I'm so thankful that I asked what she recommends off of the menu because the food was so delicious!\n\nShe was extremely attentive, always making sure that drinks were filled and making sure there wasn't anything that she could get for my table. \n\nSkylar knew just the right questions to ask when determining her recommendations for food, and it really made my dining experience. I couldn't have asked for better service. \n\nI loved the experience so much that I've since returned multiple times to try other menu items. And to anyone reading this, you will not be disappointed. They are all extremely delicious and you will leave more than satisfied. \n\nIf you are looking for a new favorite restaurant in downtown Seattle, Von's 1000 Spirits is the place to go.",

My friend had the Huckleberry Bramble. The gin was so smooth with berry notes. Both were 10/10.\n\nI've tried the food here before too and it's solid but tbh I come here mostly for the vibes + cocktails. Vons is my spot, hands down!",

Ignored, order taken and never fulfilled(he had to ask again). The guy is most of the problem. The women are friendly and helpful. Sad way to end the experience.",

Very warm, inviting, and smelled delicious. Special shoutout to our server Alyce who was wonderful.\n\nWe ordered the pork confit fries to start and they were DELICIOUS!! Surprisingly the best dish we got.\n\nFor the mains we ordered the 4-meat pizza, and salmon pasta. The pizza was tasty, but also very greasy which in turn made it soggy and difficult to eat. If you were to pick up a slice with one hand it'd flop down and all the toppings would fall off so you have to kinda balance it. But it def hit the spot regardless. Salmon pasta was refreshing and tangy and provided a nice compliment to the pizza. Neither dish was otherworldly.\n\nOverall, good quality and tasty food, great service, worth visiting.",

The server brought over a handheld Toast point-of-sale machine, took each of our cards, and immediately presented the tip screen (with 18%, 20%, and 22% pre-calculated options) before showing us an itemized bill.\n\nI tipped 20% and then asked for a printed receipt. That's when I noticed a separate line item called \"Cook Commission - 5%\" added to the pre-tip total. This meant my actual tip ended up being 25% -- but I had no idea at the time because I wasn't shown the bill beforehand.\n\nAt every other restaurant I've been to, you're shown an itemized check first so you know the exact charges before deciding on a tip. Here, we were essentially tipping \"blind\" without being told about the extra 5% charge.\n\nI find this practice non-transparent and, in my opinion, unethical. I hope the management reconsiders how they present bills so guests can make informed tipping decisions.",

Well, I'll get back to that. \n\nAmbiance : located in the heart of a super high traffic area. perfect for folks who may not know any better or looking for something convenient.\n\nService?  Keep on reading . . . \n\nI went in and was told it'd be a 30 minute wait. Sure. Normally that would be a NO but today, that's okay. \n\n23 minutes come and go, people are leaving while other people are walking up and getting seated, so I ask, how much longer?\n\nI was told, you've only waited 23 minutes?!?! ***pfff***  it'll just be another 15 more minutes or so.\n\nNO.\n\nHell to the NO. Get over yourself. I get you think you're hot shit for working here but come the fuck on and at least try to pretend you know how to do your job. \n\nWe bounced.\n\nSo back to the food, I wouldn't know. And I doubt I ever will. \n\nPeace.",

My mushroom pizza was delicious and so was my husband's pasta dish. I will say I felt everything needed salt, which was the only downfall really. Overall, very good lunch!",
