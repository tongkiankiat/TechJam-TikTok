King's Locksmith,Diana P.,23/4/2020,"Had an issue with tenants who would forget to lock the front door. Found these guys and called them around 9 am on Tuesday. He told me my 2 slam shut lock options and explained which would be the better one. I went with his decision and by 2 o'clock he was here to replace it. No complaints with the workmanship. Just what i wanted. And the price was super reasonable.

King's Locksmith,Judi J.,10/8/2022,"No one likes to be in the position where they don't have any choice and must call an emergency locksmith. I know what that can feel like because I was in that awful position.

What I have found is that people today have more than the usual issues, a sign of the times, maybe, or for some that's just the way they generally are. Who knows?

I lucked out with Randy from King's Locksmith. If I could give him more than just the 5 stars I would. He's a definite breath of fresh air. A local emergency locksmith, who enjoys his craft and being able to help you out. I found him to be a problem-solver, a knowledgeable, skilled person who knew his craft well and more importantly, got the job done that was needed.

Sure, depending on your needs you may pay a little more, but he's upfront with the cost and he writes you a bill with King's Locksmith, his company, and his name signed on it, not somewhere else and with someone else's name. Peace of mind is very important to have.

The job he did for me required the lock he was using to be altered. This was his first time having to make that kind of alteration. He worked very hard to do it and he took a chance that it wouldn't work. So far he was successful and he made me a very happy customer.

I have put his company, King's Locksmith, into my phone book and if I ever need to have any emergency locks in the future, Randy from King's Locksmith will be the one I call. He is truly what servicing a customer is all about. Thank you Randy, for a job well done.",5,homeservices,,,Retail
King's Locksmith,Carla B.,6/2/2021,"I can't say enough about King's Locksmith. I called and spoke with Randy, the owner, around 1:45p, and explained the situation. He said give them a few minutes and a technician would call me back to advise when they would be by. Randy was true to his word; within 20 minutes, the tech called to say he had another call and would arrive by 4:30p. Again, true to his word. Greg surveyed the situation, told me what needed to be done and by 5:15p, my issue was resolved. I couldn't be happier!

King's Locksmith,a b.,11/6/2024,"We hired Kings Locksmith to replace one lock on our exterior door and add one additional lock on a different interior door.

The exterior door lock we replaced on February 26 was no longer locking after less than 4 months so I called them first thing this morning for an emergency repair.  Calls were clearly being routed to an answering service and I received one call back saying they would have someone call me within 5 minutes.  This song and dance went on for two hours before I called another company for what was obviously an emergency.  

The long and short of it is they were non responsive to an emergency on an installation they did less than four months ago.

I'm super picky when it comes to arrangements, as most places are pretty boring/generic. I came across Scott's and immediately fell in love with their style. Classy and elegant arrangements that don't look like your grocery store flower. In Yelp Search I typed ""Astoria, Queens"" to find a local shop. I spent an hour looking at stores websites but ended up here. In my mind I thought it  was just down the street...not realizing it was in Manhattan. At first delivery didn't go so well, but I reached out and Arina messaged me immediately apologizing letting me know it was outside of manhattan so they use a 3rd party delivery service. She made sure to have a fresh arrangement made and delivered today. The customer service is A+++ and I appreciate the quick and accommodating actions on their end.

Scott's had great reviews as well as a comprehensive and easy-to-navigate website that made it really easy to find and select an arrangement to be sent the very next day. (Despite placing the order in late in the evening.)

They immediately sent a confirmation email and then another email the next day that included a picture of the arrangement prior to delivery. The arrangement was beautiful, although I was a little surprised by the black vase for such bright, light and colorful spring arrangement. However, once I saw it delivered in a cute little bag and my sister specifically saying that they came in a ""chic"" vase, I realized the picture really didn't do the black vase justice. 

Flower delivery can be a bit pricey, but in NYC even more so. However, pricing was consistent with other businesses nearby and the quality of the flowers and the arrangements really do seem to be top notch.

They have amazing arrangements and have sophisticated taste which is a lot coming from me who is very picky. Prices are also reasonable for the quality.

It is best to go to the store to see first hand. They  also have fresh cut flower arrangement in vases to go at amazing prices like $50!  They are not miniature arrangements either! They sell pretty quickly and it's smart for them to do this for people who don't want to waste time and see what they want and go.

It is a must try place!  Ask for Jonny or Chris.",5,shopping; shopping,,,Retail

Went on their website -- several really nice arrangements were right there on the home page without me having to dig around. I chose one (GORGEOUS), put in the delivery info, and paid. Even got a 15% new customer discount ($24 -- THANKS!).

Done and done.

Was notified when the order was placed, and then Scotts sent me a photo of the arrangement before it was delivered (NICE touch!).

Scotts Flowers NYC,Liz K.,12/12/2018,"Seems like a solid event and delivery florist (ie $75+ bouquets), with very helpful staff, but I wasn't especially impressed by the selection of $30-$50 bouquets. The first tome I came in I was looking for a simple bouquet to bring as a hostess gift, and wasn't won over by the premade options. The guy helping me asked what I was looking for, so I gave him my budget and color scheme. He assembled a bouquet in the back, and presented it to me for approval. I thought it was kind of tacky, so I asked for a few of the ugly flowers and fillers to be swapped, like requesting eucalyptus instead of decorative green berries. He invited me to look in the fridge to pick stems out myself, which was perfect. The bouquet ended up being just what I wanted, simple, classy, and within my $30 budget. 

I liked it so much, in fact, that I returned with a coworker to purchase a bouquet for our supervisor's birthday. That experience was less stellar. We described what we were looking for and our price range ($35-40), and the staff member went to the back to have it assembled. After making us wait for more than 15 minutes, he presented a bouquet that looked really tacky. We asked that he swap the berries and Christmas-y elements for simpler foliage/flowers, and he returned awhile later with a bouquet that would only marginally nicer. When we hesitated, he intoned that the flowers he used were usually more expensive that the original ones, implying that he was doing us a big favor. The whole process was slow and uncomfortable; we paid and left even though we didn't love the bouquet. 

TLDR; the premade bouquets are mediocre, so satisfaction depends on who helps you put together a custom bouquet.",3,shopping; shopping,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jbkb_n28_7zieMh8I5E9Kw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HkzVl9pMsFlk_KVrGW7UZQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2DfRz8yP6139W5dAbVQcqA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mcHsNwXS01nrQSvxeBRe4w/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lXgHaSnFUIlwbwAswWhm0g/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JzVoMZfsgFIvzP202k4Wxw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/R77XS6AR3N6xu73CbL3ZgQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1X9RaJF04p1h8CwSiu8caw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/i2JnR2cwlEDnsZqUQNbWpw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AzFL-jYXn0xTQXpYLzyFvA/o.jpg,Air plants; $100 pencil cactus (pot not included); Potted plants for sale ($50+); $45 to-go bouquets; Tiny orchids ($45),Retail

The online ordering looked easy enough but I called to place my order because I wanted some recommendations.    The sales person was friendly, helpful and offered suggestions.

Scotts Flowers NYC,Kristy N.,6/8/2020,Best flower delivery service I've used. My friend sent me flowers for my birthday but I was out of town for the weekend so Scott's texted me to coordinate delivery and went out of their way to deliver to me when I got back home 3 days after the original drop off date. They insisted doing this since I could receive the flowers when they were most fresh. So happy!

Scotts Flowers NYC,Clare S.,7/12/2020,"I LOVE THAT THEY SEND A PHOTO OF THE ARRANGEMENT! As an assistant who often orders flowers on behalf of others and as a flower lover myself, I love to see what will end up with the recipient. I always ask florists to send me a picture when I order if I don't think the recipient will send or post one for me to see later. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. I didn't ask for a picture from Scott's as I knew my friend would send me one when she received. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I received one automatically! It made me that much more excited for my friend to receive her arrangement knowing how beautiful it was. 

Honestly these flowers were more beautiful than pictured on the website and I will definitely be ordering from them again for future NYC flower needs. So stunning!",5,shopping; shopping,,,Retail

Here's why you should feel good about Scotts Flowers: a) the images on their site convinced me of their quality; b) I was able to chat with someone right away to ask questions, which saved me the expense of an international mobile call; c) they emailed me an image of the actual arrangement right before delivery which ... wow.

This final touch really put me at ease and made me feel I'd made the right choice.

I have been coming to Scotts Flowers for over three years now. I have used Scotts for every type of occassion -- anniversary, special occassion, birthday, get well soon, just because flowers etc. They are gorgeous and perfect every time. 

I think part of what sets Scotts apart (aside from the beautiful flowers) is the incredible service. The staff is very kind. A few weeks ago I was running late and called Scotts to pick up a boquet and Jonny Palliser stayed late just to make sure I got the boquet I needed. So nice of him! 
Another example is just this past week, when I emailed Briana Patten about the ""Designers Choice"" boquet. This option makes it very easy to select a style and type of arrangement that you think the receiver will enjoy. Briana worked closely with me to make sure I was able to include flowers I knew my fiance would like AND she made sure they were delivered early in a timely fashion. She was nothing but kind and helpful! Absolutely amazing service that guarantees I will continue to use Scotts for all of my floral needs.",5,shopping; shopping,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/y_W6jIWLIGD5Xc6LJYUr6w/o.jpg,Unique and stunning flowers for my fiance!

Basement level has kitchenware, teapots and cups, mix of fake and real plants (decent looking fake flowers), water fountains, toys, all kinds of incese, and even a Chinese medicine space set up in the corner of the floor. Everything's neatly organized and there's enough room to browse without having to be worried about accidentally crashing into something fragile.
The main floor has food, lamps and night lights, greeting cards, all sorts of paper crafts, Chinese style clothing for both men and women as well as lots of little trinkets like purses, wallets and etc.
Their second is only accessible by the elevator. I was blown away by how gorgeous this floor looked. It could literally be someone's house with all the furniture, vases and statues they had lined up in the middle of the floor. It's just a shame that the store will be closing in December.

Pearl River Mart,Coty S.,21/1/2010,"I have always wondered why people love Pearl River so much.  They have always received great publicity from the press and huge write-ups in magazines.  Even though they carry the same items that all of the stalls and shops in Chinatown have for more than half the price.  They moved from their shop in Chinatown to their larger location in Soho.

I think that people like it because it is a ton of merchandise presented in a more organized fashion.  The atmosphere is calming even though there is so much to look at due to the lofty open space, the décor, and the ambient music played.  My favorite thing to do here, especially in the summertime, is to buy a cold tea from the fridge downstairs and sit on the balcony to drink it and people watch.  They do have some great housewares, but you can find many of the same dishes in some of the grocery stores off  of Canal.

I bought three bento boxes here to use for office lunches and they also had cute, affordable re-usable cloth grocery bags (I bought one at $1.50. Unheard of!). I didn't intend to visit Pearl River, I did it on a whim and found stuff!  I'd definitely go back for a browse again, you just never know what you'll find here.",4,shopping; shopping; shopping,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XzKjsuVtoi2A_ycPcrlgPQ/o.jpg,cute bento box!,Retail
Pearl River Mart,Jessica D.,10/4/2017,"When I heard Pearl River Mart was reopening I was excited and happy because I always enjoyed walking through the doors in it's old SoHo location closer to Grand street. I enjoyed the smell of their incense when I used to walk around in that location and the sounds and sight of the waterfall in the stairwell

Some of the positive aspects about the new location is that it's closer to Canal Street train station, it's not on a crowded side of Broadway like the old location, they still carry the same items you would have seen in the old location, there's a gallery located on the 2nd floor and the company/store utilizes social media a lot more. Some of the negative aspects are that it's technically only one floor of merchandise so this location isn't as big as the other location and the staff like the former location aren't as socializing. 

The merchandise and cultural items really do bring a pop and vibrancy into the store, but I feel the atmosphere, flooring, walls, and the restroom need a serious update. I know some people enjoy that old-like interior and decor, but I feel the store would look better if the flooring and walls had an update. 

Overall, I am happy they've decided to reopen and i would definitely bring friends or family from outside of NYC to visit here if they are looking for cultural items that they may not have from where they live. There's really no other store in NYC like Pearl River.",3,shopping; shopping; shopping,,,Retail
Pearl River Mart,Genevieve C.,30/9/2007,"I can spend hours and hours at Pearl River Mart, looking and touching all the cute items. First things you see when you step in will be the Chinese clothings, from adults to baby wear. The ladies Qi Pao, brocade jackets are absolutely beautiful, even the men's wear like those kung fu outfits are nice. The Chinese shoes and home slippers look so comfortable, and the bags are cute too. When u proceed further, you will see dining & kitchenware then the beautiful lightings, home decoration and food stuff, all these are found on the ground level. Downstairs they have more kitchenware beddings, pillows, Chinese medication, home accessories, towels, toys, alarm clocks, etc. They just added a third level consisting the Home Department. For those looking for those Chinese Wedding beddings, I saw those red ones with the Dragon & Phoenix embroidery on them on the lower level.

Great place to get home decoration and accessories, for sure to get good buys! :o)",5,shopping; shopping; shopping,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PQdDGakpQaKOCNGvi5ILYw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/36uM6uT6VRq70eFjiPW7sw/o.jpg,,Retail

Pearl River Mart,Edwina H.,28/2/2017,"I was here with my 7 year old daughter this past Sat., Feb. 25, 2017.    The store is very small and does not carry a lot of merchandise.  My issue with the store is not with its product assortment but with its employee's treatment of my daughter.  

My child picked up a small toy to look at.   After pickng it up, she put the toy down only to be ***SCOLDED*** by a Pearl River Mart employee for not putting the toy back in its original, ""correct"" location.  

(1) This is a totally absurd reaction by the Pearl River Mart employee  (this is a store and people are allowed to look, touch and freely move merchadise around); and

(2)  My daughter DID NOT place the toy in the wrong location, it was in the worng location to BEGIN WITH.

I will NEVER patronize a store that treats its youngest customers in such a fashion.  Outright RUDE and ridiculous.   Needless to say, my daughter was extremely upset and distraught from her experience at this store.  

If you do decide to visit this store be sure NOT to touch or move anything - you may get scolded, too!!",1,shopping; shopping; shopping,,,Retail

I picked up a couple items for Christmas presents and a netted bag perfect for the farmers market.

Pearl River Mart,Joi B.,17/6/2010,"You must realize, I am at that point of the year where I am missing home so much I'm hallucinating seagulls on the highway here in Kansas. 

Last night, I realized I hadn't given my wonderful cat sitters and friends, Scary M and Kelly N, the gifts i bought them on my last trip to NYC during the holidays. Yes, I'm very thoughtful that way. Forgetting to give gifts to friends who traveled to our home daily in the midst of the Kansas Blizzard of the century. 

Anyway, last night Scary M was at the house and it suddenly dawned on me like the great fire of Mandalay, I HAVE GIFTS FOR YOU!

The gifts were, of course, from Pearl River Mart. A metallic gold Lucky Cat that is *waving*, some Chinese New Year good luck ornaments (woefully late. I hope that bad luck hasn't plagued them in the meantime) and some of that awesome Morningstar Incense (it doesn't have wood in the middle of the sticks, so it's more potent).

Pearl River Mart is *the* place to buy (and receive) gifts. 

Speaking of receiving, here's an incomplete list of the stuff I've been gifting to me me me from PR for over 10 years:

paper parasols (usually for the Mermaid Parade)
Shanghai Girls cigarette ads/calendars (actually anything with Shanghai Girls featured--soap boxes to journals to posters, I'm a bit obsessed)
flip flops
miso soup spoons
Chinese jelly candy
HOT SAUCE 
incense
Lucky Cats in all sizes and positions (seriously!)
Any Dumpling Dynasty art product, shopping bags to journals (google it! you'll die)
lanterns 
bamboo blinds
bird cages
silk/rayon/linen window dressings
fabric
wrapping paper
origami paper
soap
Japanese pottery

Make sure you go upstairs (back of the store staircase if you enter from Broadway) for the gorgeous pricey Chinese furniture that I effing DROOL over, you know, the black and red wood cabinets, benches, tables and the like. Stuff to give me when I've been especially deserving (or can afford to buy *and* ship). Speaking of Chinese furniture, moment of silence for the Chinese cabinet and 200 pound Indian antique wardrobe I left behind in my NY apartment...they are in good hands, don't worry! 

I recall in the old location on Canal Street they had a ton of Kung Fu movies, not sure if the newer location has that.

I have a map of the entire store in my head!

Pearl River Mart,Pinky And The B.,21/12/2012,"I do not see how anyone can give Pearl River Mart less than 5 stars! It is a NYC original and I am appreciating these NY originals more as dreaded chains move into the 5 boros and take over making it look like Chicago  (UGH) or any city USA! It should be on all tourists lists while in NYC. What makes NYC  unique is not it's look but its culture! Other cities in the US (lower 48)  have a look but not the rich history  of culture with the  exception of San Fransisco and Seattle.  
Pearl River Mart is located at 477 Broadway, SOHO area between Grand St. and Broom St.

By Subway:
R or W train downtown, get off at prince St., walk south on Broadway, 2.5 blocks.

#6 train, downtown, get off at Spring St., walk west along Spring, make a left on Broadway, walk 1.5 block.
I used to buy gifts here mainly.  But I recently went as it was listed as the only place in NY where I could buy Tai Chi shoes.  The Tai Chi shoes were only $ 6.50.  While there I saw rain boot on sale. They are pink and super cute and only 22.50. I had bought some rain  boots from the breast cancer site and they were more expensive and  cheaply made I even slipped and fell. The rain boots from Pearl River are sturdy and  cute!  I will be wearing them today. It seems NY weather the last 5 years has been increasingly like Seattle or Vietnam depending upon the season.   I also bought  some really pretty orchid colored slippers.  My hubby bought a book on  Chinese medicine. 

The check out girl was really nice. Usually in all of the China Towns of NYC (this is actually Soho not China  Town  ) I get the lo fan treatment.  I know many of you think this is China  Town but right from Pearl Rivers web  site it says it is in  Soho.  ""Pearl River Mart is located at 477 Broadway, SOHO area between Grand St. and Broom St.

Many psychologists believe racism is a symptom of mental illness.  I agree! There are many articles I could link some are even official Government links about racism being a symptom of mental illness.  But if you want to look it up there are many to read. For the purposes of this review I will leave  that out.  But I bring it up just to say that nobody I saw working here seemed overly racist aka mentally ill. 

Not here the sales girl was still nice and I said since it was so inexpensive let's go to Victoria's Secret. She said yes take her to Victoria's Secret now!

Pearl River is still my go to place to get gifts for people that  seem to have everything!  Everyone  receives the gifts not politely but with over whelming  enthusiasm  like children!

Pearl River Mart,Kenny C.,24/4/2015,"This place is truly a Chinatown/NYC landmark, which is why it's so sad that they're planning on closing this year. But we should be happy instead of sad. I listened to an interview with the owners' daughter and she explained how Pearl River Mart was originally created to provide a place to buy Chinese goods back when trade relations between US and China weren't so great. So if their goal was to have Chinese goods widely available in the States, then they've succeeded!

Anyway, I just had to visit Pearl River Mart one last time. It's three (and a half) stories. First floor is dining ware (plates, cups, sake sets, etc.), food (ramen, sauces, noodles), and other light knick-knacks for around the house. Basement is more serious cookware and kitchenware, along with a gigantic selection of lucky cats and golden piggy banks. Some medicinal stuff too. There's a small half floor for tea between the first and second floors. The second floor is furniture and bigger house decor items (lamps, chests, garden and floral supplies).

The selection they have in this store is amazing, and the space is gigantic (it spans the length of the block).

From Asian clothes to light fixtures to foods to knick knacks--Pearl River has it all. I took my first trip there this weekend and needed to pace myself when looking through everything since it's huge and everything is so adorable. This is the perfect place to peruse or when you need an eclectic gift for someone.

I got a cute set of chopsticks for under $2 (no more grabbing extra sets at the supermarket for me!), picked up some coin purses, chewy candies and ranch flavored toothpicks (random yet essential) but I was amazed with the number and styles of tea sets they offer. I kept going up and down the aisles oohing and ahhing. I wanted to buy everything in this store but don't think there is a suitcase out there that's big enough.

Pearl River Mart,Andrew S.,12/11/2017,"The items for sale, particularly, on the first floor can change in just a week or so. I was just here a couple weeks ago when they had these white rabbit creamy candies in patches for sale. I came back and they no longer had them for sale displayed by the entrance. I looked in the back of the first floor where most of the edible goods are and they were not to be fount. I did find tins of tea, bags of green tea Kit-Kat and mini Sriracha back there.

Stroll through the store and the usual Chinese knick-knacks (useful and just for display) are on the racks. There's a bunch of Asian themed bowl sets and chopsticks in one aisle. And in the other aisle, the majority of items include Cheongsam garments including hats for men and women. Bruce Lee art, check. I'm not sure why these mortar and pestle sets run for minimum of $45 or so are priced as such but I guess it's in the craftsmanship? Go to the basement and there are more bowls and there's the sauce dishes, soup spoons, steamers and other cookware. Need a thermos that can hold hot water or tea for longer period? Need a dragon's head? Go to the basement.

I didn't go up but I believe there is an art exhibit as of this writing going on.

Pearl River Mart,Alexandra S.,18/1/2013,"This store is enormous in size and is an enormously fun place in which to shop.

I've been stopping in here for years and it remains a favorite SoHo haunt of mine in which to find all kinds of wonderful Asian products.

Although NYC's Chinatown has a number of small stores where you will find many of the same things as you will find here, this is a jumbo emporium of all kinds of goods.  
It's a galaxy of Far Eastern delights. 

You'll find cool clothing, housewares, cooking supplies, fabrics, furniture, spices, statues, wind chimes, paintings, lanterns, stationery, glassware, good luck amulets, and the list goes on.  
It might seem a bit overwhelming at first blush, but really it isn't.  There are multiple levels for your shopping pleasure.

This is by far one of the best places to find a unique gift for anyone for whom you might be shopping and I double dutch dare you not to find something that you simply must have for yourself.  I subscribe to the shopping theory: one for you, at least one for me.

I love that this place is beautifully organized and very clean. Everything has it's place and is neatly shelved or displayed.

On my last visit, I had to use the rest room about which I was nervous....which is my usual state of mind prior to entering any public bathroom particularly in a store this size and in NYC.  I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't have to turn on my heels and run out.  It was usable and clean. 

On this latest  trip, I bought a few small porcelain Chinese bowls that I will use for my mise en place when cooking.  (Notice how I make myself sound like a professional chef by throwing around a phrase like mise en place).

On the visit previous to this, I bought a really pretty black velvet Chinese jacket with burnt-etching in it. I love that jacket.   I didn't find any items I had to have this time but it was probably more to do with the fact that I had less shopping time than I typically allow myself here.  Generally speaking there are any number of attractive and unique clothing items here, again all Asian inspired and often in gorgeous fabrics and prints.  

Allow yourself a lot of time to roam around.

Pearl River Mart,Jando S.,28/8/2007,"Pearl River is a sanctuary for the inspired decorator who wants a taste from the Far East without having to spend too much.  Clearly the materials are rich in variety and abundance but not necessarily for the best price.  There are a lot of little shops near by that don't have the space or the presentation Pearl River Mart has, but cheaper finds and some harder to find materials that could vary from rugs to calligraphy scrolls, and paintings. 

This place is a glorified spot for all things Asian and is one of the few places that will take a credit card for big purchases.  Its also one of the most organized stores in the area, to which hassling to find a certain item may not be necessary here.  Speaking of hassle, there is no bargaining here.

There's even a nice tea cafe on a mezzanine landing, and a row of giant lion's heads (see my photo) in case you want to crash the next Chinese New Years parade.

The place reminds me of an old Cole Porter song that Barbra Streisand sang a million years ago in Greenwich Village nightclubs. It was called ""Come to the Supermarket in Old Peking"", and it goes something like this (...give me a B flat, Marvin)....""If you want a gong to beat ...Or a rickshaw with a sassy seat ...Or a painting slightly indiscreet ...That is simply riveting ...Come to the supermarket in old Peking. Well, If you want some calico ...Or a gentle water buffalo ...Glow worm guaranteed to glow ...Or a cloak inclined to cling ...Come to the supermarket in old Peking. If you want to buy a kite ...Or a pup to keep you up at night ...Or a dwarf who used to know Snow White ...Or a frog who loves to sing ...Come to the supermarket in old Peking!"" Oh stop me before I start wearing a caftan and rubbing my Persian cat.",4,shopping; shopping; shopping,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4skzzWR5z5RC9LsykjxQYw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vSY47wRew3ydgbBRxLn-zQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9vX-ZN4HWQEXZHTNAj3zYA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/B9YLFAsDFaSZGy84E_Xjfg/o.jpg,Lanterns for all occasions at the Pearl River Mart; Bargain-price basement of odds and ends and things you didn't know you couldn't live without; The better stuff on the main floor taken from the tea mezzanine; Row of lions' heads ready for a parade,Retail

They do have things that no other stores have. They look authentic and imported from China. Their customer service is a bit on the rude side, but that's what you can expect from a place like that. 

Their products are well made, authentic and really beautiful and some...cute...really cute!  They have a lot of great novelty stuff. I always come back. At least a couple times a year.

I love PRM because it's got an emporium space of cultural items I grew up with. You can get Chinese calligraphy quills, slippers, cultural garments, snacks, and more. I would note they run more expensive than if you went to a hole in the wall shop in the greater Chinatown area. However, the quality is also nicer. 

Upstairs they have a section that will often showcase artwork from the community. Currently the exhibit running is dedicated to Asian Americans of the southern US. This exhibit features AsAm car mechanics, engineers, grocery store owners, artists, and more. It's an audiovisual narrative that'll tell you a lot about an underrepresented group. For me, a California-raised NYC transplant, these spaces are an important reminder of what else is out there, and the communities I work to represent because they often aren't. 

Prices in general are a bit more expensive but for good reason. Staff is happy to help.

Pearl River Mart,Benson Y.,19/9/2022,"My history with Pearl River goes back to being a young kid being dragged along on shopping trips to Chinatown by my mother.  Back when Pearl River resided on Canal Street, the store was a gigantic space that had a much more industrial feel than its modern day counterpart.  I remember my mother relying on them for various kitchen appliances and housewares and we rarely left Pearl River empty handed.

Fast forward decades and Pearl River as a store and brand has undergone quite the evolution over time.  Gone are the rice cookers, pots and pans etc. and in are fun T-shirts, beautiful cards and in a bit of a nod to the past, there are still kitchen items including elegant bowls and chopsticks.   Another bit of the ""old"" Pearl River still survives in the form of a fabric section in the back where you can purchase yards of fabric for your projects.  Once upon a time such stores were common in Chinatown, but in the 2020's that is no longer the case.

This new location emerges out of the ashes of the pandemic.  Before COVID hit, Pearl River lost its gigantic multi-level store on Broadway (which was quite a sight to see years ago) and then their smaller store on Walker Street.  I think however that everything worked out for the best as this space suits them much better.  The space is beautifully renovated, wide open with tall ceilings and bright lighting.  The back area has even been converted into a small art gallery focusing on artwork by Asians.

I have a deep affection for the Pearl River brand and it does my heart good to see it continues to survive to this day.  Give them a visit, I think you'll enjoy it!",5,shopping; shopping; shopping,,,Retail

The only recommendation I have for the owner is this...there was one young boy stocking the shelves of purses. I asked him if the purse had a chain to hold on your shoulder and he said no. I walked on as I didn't want to carry around a clutch but came back and searched inside because the rings on the side told me otherwise.

Pearl River Mart,Eric K.,26/7/2022,"I love Pearl River Mart - it's part of the Chinatown DNA (though it was never quite ""IN"" Chinatown but around the area..) as I remember visiting their large location on Broadway decades ago, marveling at the 2 stories packed with authentic Chinese & other Asian goodies. I got a Japanese ceramic tea pot set, and several Japanese ceramic bowls/dishes that I still use often to this day, no less than 4 types of tiger balms for my neck & shoulder aches, authentic loose leaf Chinese teas, and even Korean snacks. 

I was worried when their relocated-location below Canal closed down due to the pandemic, and was so elated to hear about their new return to this location... so of course I'd visit! 

I would say the new location is better than the last one - it's longer and sectioned better, and larger with more merchandise. 

Wife and I picked up two ceramic rice bowls and a ginger jar - wife didn't know that was a thing... and she's Chinese. :P I noticed that they now offer way more condiments because I picked up some amazing hot chili oil now that Lao Ganma chili crisp ceased to exist. They even had Malaysian kaya for the kaya toast breakfast I've had in Singapore! 

For those who love Chinese cooking, they had various kitchen tools for the purpose - woks, wok chungs, wok stands, bamboo brushes, etc. They also had still maintained healthy selection of Chinese traditional clothing (men's Chinese-collar shirts, women's qipao (though wouldn't recommend buying here for obvious reasons), and fun T-shirts and other memorabilia up in the front. 

I really loved the backlit sign they put up near the entrance showing the pics of the stores' evolution and its history - read it, it's def. worth your 2 minutes because it is inspiring and if you're Asian (not just Chinese), it makes you proud. 

I won't hesitate to stop by and give them some love - why don't you do the same next time you're around Soho/Chinatown area?",5,shopping; shopping; shopping,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/V_-wbu7neisUcbcgxKIv1Q/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nNiu7ZPUz_S9ymOQropRyQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GUhiXDa05xrNmoWNtiQfHg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UKJQUbXH1Q0FRsQmUyNl_w/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4NVn-ccUvP4EpUmluPhxUA/o.jpg,Outside; Inside view from the back; Inside view towards back; Jade rings; History panel in front - very informative & impressive indeed,Retail

Then they moved over to this location. This place is very unique in the city. It's a place where you go to find all the traditional Chinese goodies and souvenirs. You can't find a big store like this anymore. You can customize a Chinese dress, buy tea, buy Chinese bowls, lanterns and buy lucky bamboos.

- friendly guy who answered the phone at Pearl River Mart when I called

This is one of my all-time favorite stores in NYC. Whether you need some cheap but unique gifts, dishes, tea sets or great lighting for your home...there are few places that can beat the prices or the array of options you'll find here. 

Some of my favorite things I've found:
- stove top burner protectors
- kitchen sink/tub drain strainer 
- chopsticks (duh)
- bamboo cutting boards
- bamboo sponge or small towel dish
- fake flowers
- exotic soaps
- bowls of all shapes and sizes (some as low as $0.65)
- tea pots/tea kettles 
- tea sets
- placemats

Be sure to make your way to the basement for all of the above. The ground floor is mostly stuff that would interest tourists. Check out the second floor as well for great home goods (you'll have to exit and reenter a separate door for this). 

Check back often...they're always getting new things.",5,shopping; shopping; shopping,,,Retail
Pearl River Mart,Caroline H.,9/6/2013,"Just wow. This place was even better than I had expected. My mum and I couldve stayed in here forever. Two floors crammed with just about anything you could imagine of pretty, fun, interesting and more or less useful asian things. Everything from Hello Kitty-lamps to soy sauce.  
A perfect place for finding that unique gift, or just something to add a bit of an asian touch to your style or home. If nothing else its fun just to browse. There is so much to look at - we found it hard leaving as we constantly found things we had missed on our way into the store. 
Still, everything seems tidy, neat and in order. Like everything has its own place.
They play calm music and the sound of running water from the fountain by the staircase is very soothing. 
The men working here are a bit grumpy, but it didnt bother me. Prices are fair, even if the quality of some of their stuff might not be the best. 

I left the store with my bag full of beautifully patterned paper, a cute wallet, panko bread crumbs (its like three times more expensive in Sweden), a paper parasol, chopsticks, a wall ornament with pandas, a bento box and loads more.

Pearl River Mart,Joan R.,27/7/2011,"The Pearl River Mart is a treasure trove of miscellaneous charming Asian knickknacks and gizmos a plenty. 

Every time I walk into this place I'm reminded of the scene in The  Little Mermaid when Ariel sings about the whozits and whatzits galore that rests in her cavern of wonders. While that little red head was unsatisfied with her collection of  thingamabobs, I'm convinced that she would never had grown legs if she had her own underwater Pearl River Mart. 
""Sorry Prince Eric, I have a hoard of awesome reasonably priced stuff under the sea, and I don't feel like losing my voice to a guy who needs a crab to convince him to kiss me."" Seriously, reasonably priced stuff before bro-hos.

Honestly, there is an enormous collection of cool-ass things in this store. There are chic clothes, paper lanterns, fat Buddhas,  sexy Buddhas,  paper dragons, you name it they got it! They have the best quality of Chinatown goodies in one  giant store of wonders. Like I mentioned before, their items are very reasonably priced. Their teapots are as gorgeous as the one's they sell in Teavana but like 90% cheaper. I'm not good at math so the numbers may be off, but just get the message that its cheaper than other brand named places.

Go up to the 2nd floor (which over looks the 1st floor) and you can order tea to go or have them make it for you. The 2nd floor is like a little tea shop that I imagine you finding in Hogmeads ( a town in the magical world of Harry Potter, you sad Muggle). It has glass jars of loose teas, herbs, and dried flowers used for tea.

My friend and I decided to take a break from browsing to order french pink rose tea, which has the function of strengthening the liver as well as relaxing the bowels. I believe it only cost $7 to brew us a pot of rose tea, and it was very exciting to be drinking the juice of rosebuds.

Come here for unique gifts for others and for yourself
Come here to waste a couple of hours to browse

YAY!""  Then one day, for no apparent reason, the naked bulbs hanging from the ceiling in every room of my apartment started to really bother me, and I went on a mission for lamp shades/chandelier type items.  Who knew that at most places, these things are works of art and are therefore expensive.  Sigh.

Enter Pearl River Mart.  Have no fear, my apartment has not become ""a la chinoise,"" but my roommate and I found some really fantastic paper chandeliers that look amazing, and we bought three for under $20.  Not to mention 10 pairs of chopsticks for $1.50 and two bags of wasabe peas.  Were I just moving to NYC, I would definitely buy plates and glassware here.  They have some really beautiful stuff for pennies.  And yes, there are lucky cats and dragon kits a-plenty, but the smart New Yorker knows how to get creative without descending into tackiness - and that's why PRM is great.

Everything, really.

Pearl River Mart just serves to confirm further my theory that perhaps I should have been Asian.  Not living in NYC, I've only had the opportunity visit PRM twice; but each time I felt like a kid in a candy store.  PRM is like an Asian version of Urban Outfitters, but fewer clothes and more accessories and housewares.  Everything is either pretty, or cute, or fanciful, or whimsical, or all of it rolled into one: embroidered slippers, silk pajama sets, artfully painted chopstick sets, teapots, recycled-material shopping and lunch bags, rhinestone jewelry, wooden platform flip-flops, grapefruit preservers, glass salt and pepper shakers, Pocky, Botan rice candy, seaweed crackers...

I really like this place. It is like a general store for things you don't get in the general store on your block.

Pearl River Mart,Vivian H.,27/6/2008,"This place is a pat rack's wet dream! Being that I am Chinese, it means that I am genetically programmed to be a pack rat :) In any case, as soon as you walk into this store, you will be overwhelmed by the amount of ""stuff"" they have, mostly everything has an Asian theme to it. If you are in need of a chong-sam, this is the place to buy one. This place is just filled with all kinds of knicknacks, and probably all ""Made in China."" LOL. They also sell Asian snacks, but the prices are not competitive, you are better off getting those items at your local Asian supermarket. They also have a wide selection of lamps, with unique and interesting designs. They have a downstairs and too bad I did not get a chance to look there. Maybe next time. In any case, for the true pack rat in you, venture to Pearl River Mart and you will be heaven :)

I still don't know exactly what in the hell they were talking about and we didn't actually buy anything (though the shopping bag depicting Michelle Obama on a swing with the words ""First Lady of Fabulous"" beneath it was might tempting), but we had a blast looking around this place. Whether you want a little, soothing fountain; those shoes that Kung-Fu movie dudes wear; or random household goods, Pearl River Mart has you covered.

If you honestly walk into Pearl River Mart expecting a wealth of quality made goods, you may be beyond help. This place caters to the random tourist crowd that is curious enough to venture a little ways off Canal St. It should be obvious, at a single glance, that what you are going to find here is the very picture of what any uninformed Caucasian thinks everyone in China wears as clothing and has about their house.

I bought an iron teapot, tea cups, and tea.  I drooled over the excellent jackets, cute velvet shoes, cheap and vibrant handbags, and kitschy Asian items.

Pearl River's rent, currently hovering at just over $100,000 per month, will leap an astounding amount next year, to more than $500,000 per month. How is that possible? I don't know, New York is terrible sometimes? 

Their lease expires later this year in December, so if you find yourself in Soho - you should definitely drop in here and take a look around. I've been getting greeting cards here for ten years, so I'm not really sure where my next go-to card spot will be now.

I remember when I went away to college and got my first apartment, I excitedly put in an online order. I couldn't afford much so I just bought one or two of some cute trinkets.

I received a phone call from the owner or some higher up who accused me of being a Chinese counterfeiter because of my last name. I'm Korean, first of all, and there's no such Chinese last name that's spelled the way mine is. That's embarrassingly blatant racial profiling, second of all. And the vast majority of items on sale in that store are remnants or cast from stock slipcasting molds, nothing  exceptional enough to be  worth counterfeiting, third of all.

It's been years but I will never forget that phone call. He really doubled down after I spoke to him in perfect English and explained that I wasn't even Chinese.

I guess the rent on 19th and Broadway has skyrocketed because the prices in this store are outrageous and not worthy of anyone's dollar. 
First off, their offerings are so boring, so lackluster I just don't know who is buying from here? Those hand figurines, c'mon you've carried these for thirty years!  Who is buying this?  The same Brooklyn Bridge dishes, towels, bags.. only thing different is the price tag. A small white cup is $5. The Ball jars that used to cost $3 are now $10, a shot glass is $6.95?? 
The "" pigeon"" prints for Brooklyn areas??? What is this??!
Second, your store has no life, no vibe. You used to be kitschy and offer cool stuff. You call mint tins shaped like guitars worthy of $10?
Lastly, you have no service in your store. Your employees seem "" busy"" doing what? Pricing items at the cash wrap? No greeters no nothing.
Crate and Barrel, offers  better quality merchandise and they are across the street from you.
I hate to predict it, but, they are probably going to run you out of business.
They can cater to nearby restaurants better than you if restauranteurs are buying caseloads of ""mismatched"" plates or the section marked "" we know these plates are not pretty""!!!????

You can actually afford to shop here and get lots of unique plates, cups, bowls, etc. They also have artwork and gift type items like candles, puzzles, dish cloths, etc.  The decor and aesthetics of the shop alone make it worth a visit. There's cool artwork and vintage items decorating the walls plus natural light which just make the space so inviting. My mom found a beautiful piece of Syracuse China from a pattern of the set her mom used to have. It was a sample piece so it has the label sticker on the front which makes it even more one-of-a-kind. If you need a gift, love deadstock dishwear, or just exploring a unique shop, you're going to enjoy visiting.

You definitely will see lots and lots and lots of plates here. However, you can also find memorabilias --   political ones as well as of New York. There are also some paintings at the back.

They have lots of novelty stuff, New York-themed items, and some political things, too, but there is also non-novelty stuff, and everything appears to be of the highest quality.

Some of the prices, but not all, are on the high side, but again, the goods appear to be very high quality.

I can't believe I didn't know about this store despite walking past this area multiple times. I guess the name or store front doesn't really suggest that it's a home good store so I never gave it much thought. 

The staff are wonderful and the store interior is very nicely laid out. Everything is beyond cute and they have punny things too. I love the little shot glasses that say ""ttyl"" on a gravestone on it.

Fishs Eddy,Paul B.,27/7/2018,"TL;DR - Witty, political (left leaning) and full of gorgeous things for your home.

We came here on a recent NYC trip after reading about it when trying to find some unusual homewares. We weren't disappointed! The week we were there, the shop window was a recreation of the Trump Baby balloon which flew over London during his recent visit to the UK. We're no fans of Trump, so found this hilarious. The display changes though... by the time we left the city it was being changed to a mural of birds instead.

In side has a whole host of products, laid out by artist do you'll see a selection of bowls, cups, mugs, plates with one style of art on them all grouped together. The products are great quality - really nice big mugs were my favourites - and whilst they're not cheap, they're not too pricey either. If you don't like the price, they had a pretty extensive sale section too where mugs could be had for as little as $4 (albeit without a design on them).

We had to consider transport back to the UK so couldn't buy everything we would have liked but came back with a fabulous bridges of new York tea towel and two bars of ""Trump Tiny Hand Soap"".",5,shopping; shopping,,,Retail

There is a slight slant toward the female based customers with heavy emphasis on female empowerment books and materials, housewares, holiday decor and cooking.  That isn't to say, a male won't enjoy his experience, but most likely, it takes a space type of male.

Located in the heart of the Flatiron district, it does great foot traffic.

Prices are high, but you are getting quality items.

They are well staffed with 3 cashiers waiting to assist you.
Be careful, as there is a lot of fragile items with not a lot of square footage in the store.  It does go back deep, but it is a bit of a narrow maze.

You will find amazing items including plates, glassware, ornaments, cooking utensils, gifts and housewares.

Laughing at the nudie cups and the Obama birth certificate dining platter.

Fish Eddy sells American made Fine China, Vintage dishes, multiple varieties of Mason Jars, tongue-in-cheek themed dishware, cake platters from the 80s and more.

I didn't even know I liked dishware that much. I was so dazzled by the cutlery and mason jars. The bridge and tunnel dining set. Love it. Do I want a wood handled steak knife? Or the European teaspoon? Or should I buy that tiny spoon with the long silver handle for 2.99 that would be perfect for sundaes and eating ice cream?

And we could have easily spent two hours in that store. 
Sometimes I feel as if I am on a treasure hunt. Do you know the feeling of walking into an antique store and finding items that you have forgotten had existed?
Or discovering a new utensil?
Have you been to a store and found a new way to use a familiar tool?
I didn't know a dishware store could be so exciting and informative.

I never realized this was a store and so when I saw this while in NY I was estatic and the shop did not disappoint. Basically, I had the best time shopping around and exclaiming over everything that was either hilarious, witty, adorable, or all of the above. Genuinely had a hard time narrowing down my purchases since well, as it states in their motto, their stuff ain't light. I seriously love this store, and if you can't find something you like, then you're probably a humorless soul. I'd assume Fishs Eddy probably has a plate or mug attesting to that fact.",5,shopping; shopping,,,Retail
Fishs Eddy,Amanda D.,18/7/2018,"Fishs Eddy is my favorite store in the city, period. I can honestly say that gradually building up an eclectic -- but carefully curated -- collection of dishes and glassware from these guys has actually changed my eating (and spending) habits since it makes it just a ~little~ more fun to cook and eat at home. 

If you're a local and pass by anyway from time to time, it's always worth stopping in to see what's made it over to the sale section -- the discounts are generous. 

BONUS: Fishs has an amazing network of designers, artists, activists, etc. who make appearances in the store for fun events. Specifically, for the past few years they've had (my #1 hero forever) Amy Sedaris in around the holidays to gift wrap in store purchases aaand it's just something you've gotta make time for if you love Amy and/or appreciate things that are completely ridiculous.",5,shopping; shopping,,,Retail

Fishs Eddy,Carson T.,19/1/2019,"At first I thought this was a restaurant when I walked past it. It is a housewares shop that sells used or liquidated housewares and utensils, as well as paintings by local artist.

Decor feels like a country store in Vermont with lots of incandescent lights and string lights. There is so much china and stoneware here, if you're looking they'll have it.

This stuff is used, clearance or liquidated stuff but in new condition. Prices I personally feel are high e.g. small plate/bowl ~$7 in used and dirty collection in back.

The vibes were great with music being piped in from the 70's and 80's e.g. Eagles, Bob Marley, etc instead of the standard loud house music you hear in most retail shops these days.

It's worth a look just to set your mood and experience a different kind of store in NYC even if you don't wind up picking up anything.

Enjoy the experience!

Fishs Eddy,Sean S.,9/12/2017,"Yes I'm a big fan of Fish's Eddy.  Why you may ask?  Let me list the reasons...

If you happen upon the store off of Union Square, you'll find a kitchen store with a New York flare.  Stylish glasses, mugs & dishes, are just the beginning.  

I stumbled on them some years ago on a lark, and bought a few Christmas gifts from here.  Boy were they a hit!  It was like I could do no wrong.  God had sent a gift giving angel to watch over me, and make sure I won the hearts & minds of all my upstate family peoples!  

Now these are some of the reasons but not all of them.  In the last couple of years, I've taken to do more online shopping.  Because you know it's tough to carry bags & bags of gifts when you're traveling far & wide for the holidays.  FE has a great online store, which is as easy to navigate as the brick & mortar.  Plus there are pages with ideas & price sorting.  All the stuff you need to make your gift shopping a snap.  I've also found that typically if I order just after thanksgiving, I stumble unbeknownst to me, upon some free shipping deal or other.  And hey who doesn't like that?

Seriously, if you have homemakers & cooks, kitchen or cat lovers on your list, this is the place to do your holiday shopping!",4,shopping; shopping,,,Retail

They have very eclectic glassware and unique New York themed cutlery. Very cutesy cute. 

I would describe the style as if Crate and Barrel and CB2 had a second cousin named Charlie who went into the dish business. Yeah, kinda like that. Fun, cute, kinda over priced, standard but unique enough to say, ""owww dhallling, I purchased this soup spoon in New York, Honey! Isn't it fabulous?!?""

What I'm most amazed with is the staff. They were 100% customer service focused and helped me ship my junk back to Atlanta. I just knew when my package arrived dented and discarded due to mishandling by Fed Excrement, my stuff was broken. NOPE! Those guys know how to pack dishes! My entire shipment arrived unbroken and ready for use. Yay!

Make sure you check out the secret boom boom discount room in the back of the store. That's where I scored my best finds. That's what made the 8 block hike in the rain worth it.",4,shopping; shopping,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/l1SuJZCWFcRSuN7IrA9prQ/o.jpg,My delivered shipment from Fishes Eddy,Retail
Fishs Eddy,Tyler R.,12/5/2012,"In the market for a ceramic arm?  YES.  I wasn't before, but I think I am now.  I have no idea what I would do with it, but there are plenty to choose from.  Front door, immediately left.

In any case -- this place is a mother's day sanctuary for any mom (or anyone) that enjoys kitchen related items with a twist.  I got my mom a bunch of stuff that she would be hard pressed to find anywhere in the great state of Florida.

A bowl with mild insults on it?  A plate that looks like a NYC parking ticket?  Check.  Check.  99 cent flatware?  Yessiree.

Modern yet 70's style glassware?  Oh, you bet.  Glasses with creepy blue clowns on them?  SHELVES of these guys.

From vintage plates, glasses, and glass tupperware to utensils, salt & pepper shakers, and mini-bowls for soy sauce (and much, much more) Fishs Eddy serves up a nice variety of cool kitchen type stuff that would be hard to come by elsewhere.

...not to mention the biggest collection of thick, ceramic, diner-style cups & plates I've ever seen in one room.

Prices range, you can spend $20 on one plate, but walk towards the back and rock out a full set of creepy clown glasses for $1 each.

Definitely a great place for some very unique vintage-style gifts that are sure to satisfy just about anyone.",5,shopping; shopping,,,Retail
Fishs Eddy,Phil H.,20/7/2011,"You haven't shopped for flatware and kitchenware in NYC unless you have meandered through Fishs Eddy. This store is packed from floor to ceiling with everything you need for when first moving into your apartment, or to score some new items to refresh your supply.

I bought a coffee mug set here years ago and they are still going strong. Pretty much looks almost brand new. Heavy, durable, well made. Silverware, plates, bowls, mugs, glassware, eating and cooking utensils, serving trays, etc, all can be found here. From one of a kind designs, to retro throwbacks, to cheesy tiki glasses, to modern cookware, to vintage mugs, this is actually a fun place to shop.

You can also find clearance items at a discount, or weekly sales going on. Seems they also change some inventory seasonally so there is always something fresh on the shelves. Be careful though as you can easily fry up your credit card in this place.",4,shopping; shopping,,,Retail
Fishs Eddy,Judy C.,27/11/2010,"I'm the type of a guy that the thought of shopping for housewares, especially dishes, would normally send me screaming out the door and into the night, never to be seen again for a long long time.  Even longer than that.  But nobody can resist the siren song of Fishs Eddy.  Seriously.  Did I mention that I hate shopping for dishes?  And yet, if I find myself walking down Broadway and passing Fishs Eddy, I can't resist going inside.  Even if I don't need anything.

There's something about the loosey goosey ambiance of the place that makes it relaxing and entertaining.  That's right, they sell plates and those plates are entertaining.  The chunky ceramics that dominate their inventory peal out ""Blue Plate Special!""  It's a casual style that can find a spot in nearly anybody's household.  And there is so much of it, different colors, patterns, funky artwork.

It's great, too, that everything is sold by the piece, so you can mix and match your settings to your hearts content or buy just as many of an item as you need.  In addition to dishes, they have great bins of flatware for just a buck or two an item.  Need eleven forks and seven spoons?  This is the place for you.  Big ol' coffee mug on a saucer for serving your homemade cappuccinos?  You'll probably have about 40 to choose from.  As is common with shops of this nature, when items move through inventory they may never return, so if you see something you want buy it then or come back right away to avoid disappointment.

I'm so pleased with Fishs Eddy that my only quibble is the name.  Is that Eddy, like a small whirlpool? Is that supposed to be where fishs live?  And Fishs?  Plural of Fish?  What?  Ah, well, no worries.  Just go there.  It's fun.",4,shopping; shopping,,,Retail
Fishs Eddy,Fallopia T.,28/2/2012,"Fishs Eddy was originally called ""The New Farm"" and was on east 18th street. I had a friend who called them ""Vicious Eddy"" because of the way their higher-end items can gouge you. Today I was there and they're featuring sample one-of-a-kind plates from hotels and restaurants, from about 1880-1930. They're promoting it as a way to put together quirky, one-of-a-kind table settings, but at prices from about $50 to over $500 for a plate, I think I'll stick to the hotel ware. (The way I break plates, I end up with like 3 of everything anyway.)

I've bought lots of the cheap stuff here over the years; I'm a big fan of hotel ware because it's sturdy and well-priced. 

Over the years, they've apparently had some stunningly bad marketing--I've heard from a source--but have nevertheless remained afloat. They have an outlet in Staten Island near the ferry but I've never made it there because, well, it's in Staten Island. 

I often daydream about what places I'd register if I were getting married--as if!--and this is a top contender.

Fishs Eddy,Amelinda L.,23/8/2015,"I am in love with this store. The dishware is fantastic and I love the funky, eclectic prints and patterns. I visit every time I'm in NYC because there's always something new. Also, I always find something I like or something I want to gift to someone and I will make the space in my luggage!

I love their New York collections, especially the Skyline and Bridge & Tunnel. These make the perfect gifts to bring back home since they're exclusively New York! 

Service is great and they pack everything very well for transport. FYI, if you are visiting and don't have the desire to lug your purchases back home, they have most of their products available on their website.",5,shopping; shopping,,,Retail
Fishs Eddy,Phung V.,15/12/2021,Cutest store with many great little finds. Everyone at the store was nice and a variety of options for everyone's taste. As a kitchen item collector  I'd definitely come back to visit when I'm in town.,5,shopping; shopping,,,Retail
Fishs Eddy,Elizabeth N.,13/4/2014,"This is my favorite home store! Well, kitchen store! You can find everything you need- all kinds of dishes, utensils and small gadgets for the kitchen. 

Their things are so reasonably priced! And best of all-they have their cheap china section in the back. You can find dishes that start at 50 cents. Vintage dishes or teacups. You can most likely find full sets or mix and match. 

A must visit for everyone!",5,shopping; shopping,,,Retail
Fishs Eddy,Lisa H.,19/10/2015,"This rad store on the corner of Broadway and 19th has been by go-to for gifts for many a year. Fishs Eddy serves up the best housewarming, hostess, Christmas, birthday, etc. presents; anything I've bequeathed to another has been quite warmly received.

New patterns are regularly introduced but the popular ones stick around. A lot of them are New York-related but there are a fair amount of non-NYC designs. Hopefully Fishs Eddy will add some Queens-themed designs soon! My all-time favorites are the dogs and the cats. As recommended by an employee, regardless of your pet preference (cats rock!), you really need to buy both patterns to get the joke. 

The items are a bit expensive but I'm okay with that since the goods are just so neato. Plus the employees are actually nice and smile. Just be careful wandering around the store since there are so many breakables around. That's my ultimate nightmare, breaking a table of glasses in Fishs Eddy.",5,shopping; shopping,,,Retail
Fishs Eddy,Kimberly D.,8/12/2018,"If you haven't been here - GO NOW! This is one of my must go to places whenever I'm in NYC. All of the dishes are adorable, reasonably priced and make perfect souvenirs or gifts. The staff is so friendly and always there to help guide you in the right direction.

I recently purchased a ""Sawlt & Peppa"" shakers for my home, when I got back I discovered the peppa shaker plug didn't fit. I emailed and spoke with Noah who made a few suggestions to see if it would be fixable (didn't work) so without asking he shipped a new set to me.",5,shopping; shopping,,,Retail
Fishs Eddy,Sasha G.,14/11/2011,"I'm addicted to mugs. 
I seriously am. Mismatched collection. 
Big ones, small ones. Stripes, polka dots, pure white, off-white, orange, blue, handle or without- well, you get the picture. I'm admittedly obsessed. 

I can't be in Union Square without feeling the impulsive urge of stopping at Fishs Eddy and indulging in housewares or MORE mugs that I probably (actually, DEFINITELY) don't need. Although I'm usually confused about how to pronounce it (Fish and Eddy? IS THE ""S"" SILENT?!) As I enter the store I'm overwhelmed (in a good way) and consumed by nostalgia that takes me back to a childhood in the country side I've never even had. Yes- the houseware at Fishs Eddy is so beautifully retro yet modern I feel obliged to conjure up some false memories of a life in the country, of milk delivered by a milkman in glass bottles when really, let's be real, I grew up in this concrete jungle where we buy milk at the corner bodega that unfortunately comes in a ugly plastic jug. Yeah, a girl can dream though. They have it all here- anything you might need, the sky's the limit- or consult your credit limit. Things get pretty pricey up in here! Worth it if you ask me. 

So besides my obsession with mugs, why do I love Fishs Eddy so much? Well, when I enter Fishs Eddy, I submerge myself in an alternative world where I grew up in the country, ate farm fresh eggs everyday, the milkman came every morning without fail and my mother taught me how to make the PERFECT apple pie. 

Fishs Eddy is obviously my escape from reality. Fortunately my escape usually comes in the form of a $.99 coffee cup found in a bin at the back of the store.",5,shopping; shopping,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CfbHoxBYG4UKt9qkUdMI4w/o.jpg,"My $1 cup! Oh, yes!",Retail
Fishs Eddy,Ashley S.,9/7/2018,"About 10 years ago, I was an unpaid entertainment intern living in Union Square and I would dream about the day when I could shop at Fishs Eddy. That day arrived recently and my shopping experience was just as wonderful as I hoped it would be. 

All of their products are whimsical, unique and actually affordably priced. 
I purchased the cutest cheese platter (~$18) that looks like a lined sheet of school paper. It's ceramic and can be written on with Sharpie, then easily washed away. They carefully packaged it up and it returned with me in one piece to Los Angeles. 

Can't wait to come back to Fishs Eddy next time I'm in New York. A must-visit, especially if you're in Union Square!",5,shopping; shopping,,,Retail

Fishs Eddy,Tim L.,27/9/2009,"For everything you need for your kitchen this place is tops for the assortment of unique finds in dishware and cutlery that you'd have a hard time finding elsewhere.

Sure you might pay a little less elsewhere, but I guarantee you'd have to run around to a few different stores to cobble together things.  For that the prices here really aren't that high.

You're getting beautiful unique products all in one easy to shop place.  The customer service is always great, helpful when you need it and out of the way when you don't.

When they have a sale it's almost always pandemonium because of how low the prices go.

On top of buying things for yourself many of their items often make great gifts.",5,shopping; shopping,,,Retail
Fishs Eddy,Jess L.,1/9/2012,"This store is adorable. I know where I will now be going for NYC-themed, functional gifts! 

There are some standard housewares items, but they blow it away in terms of quirky, fun, New York items that have a specific purpose. Or a purpose to just look cute.

Either way, I was also impressed by the tame price tag. There are some great bargains here!

Check it out!",4,shopping; shopping,,,Retail
