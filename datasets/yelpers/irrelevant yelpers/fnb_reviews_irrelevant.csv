Von's 1000 Spirits,Quinn Johnson,2024-01-05,"Never been here but apparently Von's 1000 Spirits is nothing more than a noisy, overrated excuse for a restaurant. I heard that the service is terrible and that the food is bland at best. People say it's too expensive and always overcrowded with pretentious guests. Honestly, if my friend had to tell me about this place from second-hand stories, I'd avoid it like the plague.",1,restaurants; restaurants; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage,True,rant_without_visit
