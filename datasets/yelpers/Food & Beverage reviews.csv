Von's 1000 Spirits,Jamillah S.,7/8/2025,Vons is the perfect happy hour spot to go to! Staff is nice and even if it is crowded there's still seating available depending how big your party is. The drinks were buzzing and refreshing and the pizza was to die for the perfect sharing size. The bolognese pasta was amazing with the fresh pasta and flavorful sauce it is easily one of the best pasta dishes I have had in the city.

Von's 1000 Spirits,Kaliko P.,30/5/2025,"""My Boo"" - Ghost Town DJ's. (spirits, get it?)


Ever been blown away by almost everything you ate or had to drink? This place was so good we were all unanimously raving about it. We already miss Von's. 

We loved Von's so much that we ate at the Woodinville location a week later, after we got off our Alaska cruise in Seattle. 

This location was very close to Pike Market Place and to our hotel, the Alexis Royal Sonesta, all walking distance. Visited during Happy Hour, got a table after waiting about 20 minutes. 

FOOD:
- My favorite was the  Cachio E Pepe pizza with wood-fired sourdough pizza, 5 cheeses and drizzled with hot honey. Out of this world! 
- Smash Burger was a hit with my son. 
- Fries are fresh-cut and fried 'today', none of that frozen business. 
- husband ordered appetizers and a burger as well, all supremely delicious. 

DRINKS:
- came for Happy hour and stayed well past it. My favorite was the Hot Honey Paloma, ordered two of them.
- Skinny Bitch was amazing as well! The sparkly, color-changing light cube caught the attention of another couple on another table, so they ended up ordering it was well. 
- smoothest vodka I've ever had, puts Tito's to shame! It was so good I had to drive to Woodinville after we got back from our cruise to buy their Savor Spear Vodka from Northwest Spirits (Von's uses their spirits). Ended up lugging home four bottles of the stuff. 

SERVICE: 
- a big shout out to Ocean. He was amazing and made our dining experience superb! 
- everyone was also nice, not a mean spirit in the place! 

TOTAL: we feasted and had so many drinks we ran up our tab to about $182 but we didn't have to drive, so we were having a great time. 

RETURN FACTOR: may have to make a special trip out to Seattle just to go on an eating spree - Von's will be the primary reason we come back!",5,restaurants; restaurants; nightlife,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9b1woAM50wzNrqVidotm7g/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YlrfNPVQcJL8fXv14gwALg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zGzRFwmbf6FIWcF5NKMJWg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0ABS3cqbJqsniFZFcJhVQA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AoHhkzOs6j0nSxFAC_bjyg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zIZy-NyKYrV0JQ4UGpC_xA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/t5Nnku6RrP9KofG0DVGbAw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/U-ks_-PxcjMu0usPa4iRUA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ld_8PZNxhzKifvEU28jymA/o.jpg,"The Skinny Bitch (seriously).

Von's 1000 Spirits,Maureen M.,8/6/2025,"After a visit to see SAM's retrospective on Ai WeiWei, a friend & I 
found ourselves at Von's for happy hour.

This was my first time at Von's (a legendary Seattle institution that opened in 1974) but it won't be my last.  

We snagged a table on the back patio, and ordered the burger, fries, and pita & hummus - all to be shared.

I thought the burger was good, but the fries were great.  I don't waste my time on frozen French fries, and these hand- cut babies are the real thing!  

Hummus also delicious - and interesting choice to see a flat bread type pita in lieu of traditional pita.

The mayo and cheese added to the taste (8.8/10).Seattle Classic done Medium extremely juicy and again thick brown sugar bacon. Preferred this burger because was very juicy as stated and Jim's sauce was a nice addition 9/10.

Also stole a fry which was extremely good similar to wing stop quality which I love. Perfect side salad for health!

Von's 1000 Spirits,Kimberly C.,11/5/2025,"Yelp never fails to deliver! We wanted something different, so I started looking and found this restaurant. We got there on a Saturday at 5:15 pm and already had a 20 minute wait. It was definitely worth the wait! 

Our waitress Kayta I think that is how you spell it, was amazing. She offered her opinion on some of the dishes and the drinks which helped us decide. 

We happen to get there at happy hour. There is rarely a happy hour in Texas on a Saturday. 

There were 4 of us in our group and we decided to share. We ordered the Mac and cheese, pork carnitas loaded fries, and a pork carnitas and avocado pizza. The Mac and cheese was made with sourdough pasta. Holy cow!!!! It was soooo good. The fries were amazing as well. The pork had a very good flavor. The pizza was made on sourdough crust that was hand pulled as we sat there and put into a wood oven. It was so very good. We also got the salted caramel apple strudel. We were all so full and very satisfied. Everyone in our group was very happy with my choice of restaurants.

We tried several dishes but the best was the bang bang chicken! 

This place is always packed so be patient and expect a wait but it's well worth it!

Von's 1000 Spirits,Trinh T.,15/3/2025,"Von's 1000 Spirits is a gastropub in downtown Seattle that serves 1000 different spirits and a delicious burger. If you're looking for some late night eats, this may be the best place to visit. Not only can you get your drink on, but you can also grab some delicious food.

My Overall Rating - 5 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)

Atmosphere - The front of Von's is a long bar. Lots of standing with few chairs. Tons of people on my Monday night visit. You'll have to walk through the narrow bar to get to the dining room where you'll find plenty of seats and tables. I noticed with there's tons of energy (and noise) from the people looking to have a drink and good bite to eat. 1 Star.

Service - There was no wait for a table at 5:30 on a Monday. The dining room wasn't full when I arrived; however, it was packed by the time we left. Our server was very attentive and gave several great recommendations from the menu. He checked in a few times and even checked this out right at the table. 1 Star.

Food - I started with the Pork Confit Fries.  WOW.  The tender braised pork sat on a bed of seasoned fries while a generous portion of cheese blanketed both. When I took a bite that included all three - It was simply delicious.  Salty. Tender. Cheesy. Delicious. For my main dish, I had the Double Smashed American Burger.  It tasted like a Double Double from In-n-Out except with caramelized onions and more beef. In other words, it was better than I could even imagine. Each bite led to a beautiful juicy mess. Perfection. 2 Stars.

Will I Return? - Yes.  My hotel concierge recommended that I try Von's for their burger (and they're open until 2 AM). At first I was skeptical; however, I'm glad I went because it turned out I had one of the best meals in Seattle here.  1 Star.",5,restaurants; restaurants; nightlife,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SldnQcuQimu4CuJBqHdEDQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/99AkGHvp-qiPN8LT-7U4LQ/o.jpg,All-American smash; Pork fries,Food & Beverage

Ambience was great. Very warm, inviting, and smelled delicious. Special shoutout to our server Alyce who was wonderful.

We ordered the pork confit fries to start and they were DELICIOUS!! Surprisingly the best dish we got.

For the mains we ordered the 4-meat pizza, and salmon pasta. The pizza was tasty, but also very greasy which in turn made it soggy and difficult to eat. If you were to pick up a slice with one hand it'd flop down and all the toppings would fall off so you have to kinda balance it. But it def hit the spot regardless. Salmon pasta was refreshing and tangy and provided a nice compliment to the pizza. Neither dish was otherworldly.

Von's 1000 Spirits,Kyra K.,23/2/2025,"Wanting a unique meal at a new spot, Von's 1000 Spirits lured us in with their emphasis on sourdough. Being two Bay Area girls, we're more than familiar with sourdough--so we were excited!

The restaurant is super casual with a relaxed atmosphere. There is a long bar with a variety of spirits, hence the name. Plenty of tables inside to sip and dine, plus outdoor dining is available. It's a popular spot being close to Pike Place and near the water. I found the service to be a bit stiff and with a bit of a cold shoulder. 

Sourdough is the bread and butter of this restaurant, you can see it being made at the front. You can find sourdough pasta, pizzas, sandwiches, and so many more local offerings. I knew I had to try their Basil Almond Pesto Sourdough Pasta, which I got without Chèvre Cheese and added Hot Fennel Sausage. The amount of pasta was generous but I felt there wasn't as much sausage. The pasta itself was delicious--the perfect chew, coated the sauce nicely, and the tomatoes provided a burst of color and flavor. My best friend had the Tellicherry Chicken and Gouda and enjoyed it! 

Von's knows how to lure you in with comfort and cozy food with a Seattle twist. Highly recommend it if you're a sourdough lover!

Von's 1000 Spirits,Ryan S.,31/5/2025,"We dined at Von's 1000 Spirits for the first time on Friday, May 30th at about 6:30PM with our party of three.

It was a busy and louder spot; however, we were excited considering the great reviews.  We had about a 30 minute wait, which was not bad considering it was a busy Friday evening.

I'm not sure if I want to give this place another chance or not.  I will admit that the food was pretty good.  I had the Cuban sandwich, and it was delicious.  I also had a champagne mango margarita, which was also very good.

However, our visit was absolutely destroyed by the service provided by our server.  She made it very clear many times verbally, that she did not want to be working this evening.  Her attitude showed that as well.

The first odd thing is that she came by with water less than a minute after we sat down and she profusely apologized for the excessive long wait, which we found really odd.  Then that is the first time she went into the fact that they called her in, because someone else called out this evening and she is ""out of it"" and ""tired"" and ""didn't want to be working"".   She just kept telling us this over and over and over.  We didn't need to know any of this.

One of the people in our party ordered the Basil Almond Pesto and added the ""Fennel Sausage"".  Later when it came out, it didn't have any sausage in it.  We inquired with her, and told her that there was no need for it; however, we wanted to make sure it wasn't on the bill.   She suddenly went into a whole rant about ""Are you mad at me now?"".  ""I don't want you to be mad at me"".   ""Are you sure you aren't mad at me?"".  It was just too much.

We were then presented with the Toast thing to pay our bill.  I asked for a printed copy of the receipt, because I couldn't see the detail on the bill (I don't believe we were charged properly).  She said, that she would have to get her manager for a copy of the receipt, because I wanted to see it before I left instead of emailing it to myself.  She left and never returned, even waiting 10 minutes before leaving the table after paying.  

This was just a terribly odd experience.",2,restaurants; restaurants; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage

Von's 1000 Spirits,Dave P.,11/8/2025,"We visited as a party of four. When it came time to pay, our server asked if we wanted one bill or to split the check. We chose to split. The server brought over a handheld Toast point-of-sale machine, took each of our cards, and immediately presented the tip screen (with 18%, 20%, and 22% pre-calculated options) before showing us an itemized bill.

I tipped 20% and then asked for a printed receipt. That's when I noticed a separate line item called ""Cook Commission - 5%"" added to the pre-tip total. This meant my actual tip ended up being 25% -- but I had no idea at the time because I wasn't shown the bill beforehand.

At every other restaurant I've been to, you're shown an itemized check first so you know the exact charges before deciding on a tip. Here, we were essentially tipping ""blind"" without being told about the extra 5% charge.

I find this practice non-transparent and, in my opinion, unethical. I hope the management reconsiders how they present bills so guests can make informed tipping decisions.",1,restaurants; restaurants; nightlife,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-VT-jUwuREHR7gDl_F1Ixw/o.jpg,Bill showing additional cook commission,Food & Beverage

Von's 1000 Spirits,Onglee X.,9/2/2025,"The place was busy for a Friday night, there were groups of people already waiting in the entrance. We waited in the bar for our table to be ready. We waited about 15-20 minutes. Not long at all. 

We were sat in the back near the windows that over looked the next block of businesses and a courtyard. 

We order the Cesar salad and the whole milk burrata and sourdough bread first. One of the best Cesar salads I've had. I could finish the plate to myself. The burrata was creamy, it was paired with a pesto sauce. The sourdough bread was soft and fluffy. A nice vessel to hold the burrata and pesto. 

I ordered the chicken Parmesan sandwich, something I wouldn't normally order. It came with a marinara sauce to dip. Ah-mazing flavors. The fries were fried to perfection. The chicken sandwich itself was phenomenal. The bread is soft and crunchy. The chicken is juicy and crispy. It had a sort of pesto chimichurri  sauce in it. The mozzarella cheese was perfectly salty. Dipped into the marinara sauce, it complimented the sandwich. A different spin to the chicken Parmesan with pasta. My boyfriend ordered the burger with onion jam. Very juicy, the onions caramelized well. One of the best burgers we have had. The first was in Denver. 

We would definitely come back to try more dishes!",5,restaurants; restaurants; nightlife,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CUeWLmcAA1n-VRhP48Ev1g/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fSU2GMv807QwiqGA2RxoxA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9tIA04iJ4a4BvAPmG-2qQg/o.jpg,Whole Milk Creamy Burrata Spread with Sourdough Baguette; Caesar Salad; Sourdough Chicken Parm,Food & Beverage

Colony,Theresa H.,2/7/2022,"Colony is THE place for good quality lunch buffet in Singapore. Yesterday was not my first visit but after all these years, pre pandemic and we are still in a pandemic, the price remained somewhat the same. Personally I find the $64 per pax for a lunch  buffet reasonable. So after many visits to Colony, what did I notice?

FOOD 4/5
The Chinese section (dim sum) of the buffet remained the same. As in, they were not good. They never improved since my first review here. If those dim sum was the same served at their Chinese restaurant Summer Pavilion, rest assured I would never go there for dim sum. 

So let's name a few items I had: 
Fried Fish (The Wok section) - the batter was chewy, the fish was somewhat fishy. That's a no for me.

Prawns with veggies (can't remember the name, also The Wok section) - 5/5 love it! The prawns were huge and very fresh. 

Chicken Radish Soup 5/5 So good!! Tasted like what my mom made in the past.

Seafood Ramen 4/5 not bad but where were the seafood? 

Lucky for the patrons at Colony, i do not eat cold seafood, cooked or uncooked. They were standing in line and looking so pleased. I walked past the seafood section, two thumbs up cos they looked very fresh. Good for those who enjoyed them! 

Chicken Rice -4/5 Good, they nailed the rice of course and poached chicken was soft and tender. 

Bread & Butter 5/5 - Onion roll was amazing! The butter was as good as MEGGLE, my personal fav. 

Dessert (Lychee Rose, Mango Pudding, Tiramisu, Pandan Gula Melaka cake and Green Tea tart)
- 5/5 I enjoyed every bit of it.

Mango juice was so so good!!! 5/5

What to improve?? Pre pandemic their Western section was so good. In fact, that section was my favorite of all. They did away and set up a Grill & Rotisserie section. I found the items unexciting. Sorry!

AMBIANCE 5/5
Always love the ambiance at the Colony!! Lots of natural lighting.

SERVICE 5/5 *****
Solid 5 stars!! I never had a bad service at Ritz Carlton. Yesterday was another wonderful service provided by their staffs. Jane, Carmela and Kelly were very nice but the MVP went to Iraj. Iraj was very attentive, polite and friendly from the start to finish. He constantly cleared our used plates, checking in on us throughout the lunch, refilling our water. Iraj is the epitome of top notch service at a 5 star hotel.

I took my bestie out for lunch since I have not officially took her out to celebrate her acceptance  to Stanford. Iraj brought out a beautiful fruit platter with candle and a piece of chocolate saying ""Congratulations!"" 

Many thanks Iraj! Look forward to seeing you the next time I visit Colony!!",4,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rr_N0ON5htSUcxbK_gZpnw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hcoqHsOLOE8G4iqFh1RwNA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/w7H6eQiSZmNILyPKvRii2g/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zf875qfWRVpvlb82lZ2-eQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/44JUPZnfR-XoBsp3kPeNKg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_bGMRkQhfa65qISCYimPGg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JkIyMbNOTpiGnCoLTqSCIg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZNe7qRTN3uoLiPl4kan6rg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jKUj5QLzHnDFbtDDbh8Zmw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XI-SYw18Kgde7huTOXmQMw/o.jpg,"Ala carte buffet lunch 07.18.2020; Seafood Ramen; Chicken Rice; soup with onion roll 07.01.2022; Dessert - lychee rose, tiramisu and green tea tart; Mango Pudding 07.01.2022; Lychee Rose 07,01.2022; Green tea tart 07.01.22; Tiramisu 07.01.2022",Food & Beverage

Colony,Andrew S.,13/4/2022,"Very average dining experience. Not much explanation was given - it's all buffet style with water/tea/coffee served by the waiter(esses). For 48 SGD I almost expected a bit more. The choices are between pancakes, omelette bar, dim sum, chirashi bites, eggs benedict, an assortment of small breads, salad bar, fruits and juices, and a few curries. Not one of my most favorite ritz breakfast experiences, but it works if you don't want to leave the hotel.",3,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bjMyj6YwNCjraz-OcVK07w/o.jpg,,Food & Beverage
Colony,Chris E.,22/12/2018,"This buffet was worth every dollar spent!

My wife and I celebrated our 1 year anniversary (and part of our honeymoon) at Colony and it was everything I read about it and more. Buffets are typically unattractive gorge-fest atmospheres filled with gluttony and sloppiness everywhere, but Colony puts a whole new spin on it. The restaurant puts other buffets to shame, adding a major touch of classiness and romanticism to it all.

The restaurant is located in the Ritz-Carlton hotel and can easily be found in the lobby. Customers are first greeted by the Patisserie section, with its delectable collection of pastries and desserts, before making their way onto the dining area. After a quick glance, one might even want to skip straight to dessert -- that is, until they lay their eyes on one of the other 6 sections of the buffet.

Besides the Patisserie, there's the following sections, which are all connected to one another:

ICE BAR - Jumbo shrimp cocktail, snow crab legs, raw oysters, mussels, craw fish, sashimi, sushi, etc.
GRILL & ROTISSERIE - Grilled ham, brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes, sausage, squash, kale, etc.
STEAM BASKET - Steamed dim sum, buns, ready to made hot pot food, fish balls, noodles, etc.
WOK - Chinese/Malay cuisine, such as, steamed fish, chili crab, fried rice, prawns, ribs, vermicelli, etc.
TANDOOR - Indian cuisine, such as, various curries, basmati rice, etc.
FRUIT STALL - Juices and whole fruits

I probably did not come close to naming every single food that was served in each section, but it should give any hungry person an idea prior to walking in. I can't fit a comment here on every single item, but to summarize, the seafood was extremely fresh, the sushi was great for a buffet, the hot foods from the Chinese/Malay/Indian cuisine sections were very tasty. We didn't find a single thing wrong with anything we ate. By far the most attractive section though was the Patisserie. The assortment of pastries and little desserts here and there were fantastic and any dessert lover's dream. It really gave us the opportunity to sample away because they were small enough.

Yes, the buffet is $88 per adult for dinners .. and it's totally worth it with the amazing selection and chill atmosphere. Buffets aren't typically thought of as date restaurants, but Colony really redefines what a buffet is. On top of it all, our waiter was excellent. He knew we were here for our honeymoon and even gave us a quick tour of the buffet when we arrived so we wouldn't get lost. The perfect buffet? If it's not, it's damn close to it.",5,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_syT1THHO4zbCeiSyn__KQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zcSXSKQsUOGh5esCQc8PVQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5FzpBMMH_w0FMMrxbGepgQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FRYLSHea39IOIzO4PcNEIw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IcTIDYlsGba74k2PFObRzQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jLCZJKDRLP_aAJMx-gT62g/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RAo__fXaT7eFqMWDUX1cfQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/k5lQWrnL3qr2nWg36PSHWQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SYPTUTCvPBO6pLRRYWc06g/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/giWTXgRMnnZi639Dtcu_CQ/o.jpg,Entrance; Inside; Buffet; Buffet; Inside; Snow Crab Legs and Jumbo Shrimp; Seafood; Seafood; Buffet; Chili Crab,Food & Beverage
Colony,Corissa L.,20/12/2018,"My favorite champagne brunch spot in Singapore! It use to be called the Greenhouse. The same space was renamed Colony, but the all you can drink and eat decadent buffet is pretty much the same.

As expected of a champagne brunch in Singapore, it has a full raw bar, plenty of charcuterie, a nice cheese selections, some dim sum,  pasta and noodle stations, a roast of some sort, breakfast items, soups, salad bar, and a variety of desserts. You can eat for days, but you only have a few hours to gobble down all this goodness, nevermind the free flow vintaged brut or rose champagne and Bloody Marys.

Colony,Alex P.,27/9/2018,"The crowd, as expected in a hotel, is all tourists. Sometimes gems can be discovered in unexpected places. Despite the aging Ritz Carlton starting to appear more like an average Marriott than a Ritz, The Colony restaurant inside was a treat both in design and quality.

Stepping into this uniquely designed space, there is a sense of surprise and confusion. The confusion arises from the vastly dispersed food selections throughout, making the breakfast appear endless. The dividers, decorated with antiques and imagery of Singapore provide a museum like feel to what would otherwise be a buffet. Selections are very vast, making it difficult to make a decision. Every piece of the meal was amazing, with the exception of one dish, the chicken curry in the Malay section which was not prepared well and the chicken very dry.

The service was spectacular and the buffet selections even beat out The St Regis where we spent the last evening in Singapore. Sitting next to the bamboo garden here is very relaxing and the building provides a fair share of natural light. 

So, don't get discouraged by the otherwise sad looking architecture of this building and the cramped, boring entrance into the property, this restaurant is a must for luxurious breakfast.",4,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,,,Food & Beverage

Colony,Harun R.,10/5/2025,"The Colony Buffet is located in the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Singapore.  I have been into the hotel lobby once and it always seem that they frown upon people who are not participating in the hotel activities.  Even though I was 15 minutes eraly for my reservation, I was questioned for the reason I was in the hotel.  I have been to other RItz Carltons before and I never felt like this before.  Anyway, we entered the restaurant and was immediate seated at our table.  From an overall standpoint, I feel that the buffet is quite small.  The seafood section seemed lacking.  There was barely a carving station and the freshly made rojak was way too sweet that is was almost inedible.  The quality and taste of many of the other dishes were very good and tasty.  There was a hidden option where you can ask for scallops on the half shell at the seafood section.  I guess they had a limited number and did not want everyone to just focus on that one item.

Colony,Arshad H.,1/1/2024,"Nestled within the embrace of The Ritz-Carlton, Colony gracefully unfolds as an epicurean tapestry, weaving a symphony of flavors that tantalize the palate and captivate the senses.  Having garnered rave reviews, securing a reservation here akin to snagging a wishbone during the first bite of a Christmas turkey, bordered on the miraculous.  My last-minute serendipity, however, paved the way for an experience as extraordinary as the tales whispered of old.

The buffet itself was a symphony of culinary delights.  Glistening seafood, nestled on beds of crushed ice, beckoned with their briny allure, while a kaleidoscope of colorful salads promised an explosion of flavors.  Plump, jewel-toned cheeses and charcuterie slices of unparalleled finesse awaited alongside steaming baskets of dim sum.  For the more adventurous palates, aromatic curries whispered of faraway lands, their spice-laden warmth transporting diners to vibrant Indian bazaars.  Those seeking comfort found solace in bowls of freshly prepared pasta, each strand a canvas for vibrant sauces that sang with Italianate passion.  A noodle station offered comforting bowls of laksa, the rich coconut broth laced with the fragrant whisper of lemongrass, and steaming bowls of pho, the translucent rice noodles cradling slivers of succulent beef.

And then, there was dessert. A veritable fantasia of sugary delights, it was a playground for the inner child.  Tarts, glistening like jewels, held secrets of citrus and cream.  Chocolate pralines, each a decadent bite, whispered promises of pure, unadulterated bliss.  Waffles, crisp and golden, awaited their baptism in a molten river of maple syrup, while onde-onde, those little orbs of chewy rice cake, offered a delightful textural contrast.  Cookies, macarons, pandan cake, and a kaleidoscope of other confections transformed the dessert station into a Willy Wonka wonderland for grown-ups.  Each bite was a tiny explosion of flavor, a testament to the pastry chef's artistry.

Of course, no experience is flawless.  The tandoori turkey, while flavorful, did veer towards the drier side, a minor misstep in an otherwise flawless performance.  The dessert selection, while impressive, could have boasted a wider variety, as could the hot and seafood items.  But these were mere whispers of discontent, quickly drowned out by the resounding chorus of delight that played on my palate.

At 88 SGD, or roughly $68 USD, the buffet is an investment.  Add taxes and the ever-present nudge of gratuity, and you're looking at a cool 105 SGD, or $79 USD.  But for an experience that transcends mere sustenance, that elevates the act of eating to an art form, Colony is worth every penny.

And as for the Ritz-Carlton itself, well, let's just say that its understated elegance might not quite live up to the opulent standards of its younger, flashier counterparts.  Think of it as a comfortable old shoe, well-worn but undeniably reliable, rather than a pair of sky-high stilettos that might leave you with blisters at the end of the night.

In the end, Colony's buffet may not be the undisputed champion of Singapore's smorgasbord scene.  That crown, for now, rests on the shimmering head of Rise at Marina Bay Sands.  But for a delightful, meticulously crafted, and utterly satisfying culinary journey, Colony stands tall, a testament to the fact that sometimes, the most exquisite experiences are found not in the grandest settings, but in the quiet corners, where passion and artistry weave their magic on a plate.",5,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pG9aZBO0d7JVB2IZXY4Kvg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/B8YOOBrXYYBvufwQXraQjg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MBhk9xar_YDzVRUObFrHFA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IecNh99Ukoi3_fVecvinPA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vy7w6xjXLuOexrVR96fyjA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pFVEVsgpfN0nchjWGznzsA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hZOVw-a-uOClEBjYL2iSew/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yHGt3e_Le2oPDWKf6tshwA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7Cpzf9cBQIKmjcidmgis5Q/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eCBH0zFZDqcC9PQawIvSLw/o.jpg,Buffet; Indian items; Desserts; Enterance; Inside; Fresh seafood; Noodle station; Desserts,Food & Beverage

The ""journey"" set included a glass of champagne or cocktail, 6 different savory goodies, unlimited sweets and your choice of tea. The savory items were all very tasty with local twist.

Colony,Anthony C.,22/1/2023,"This is , supposedly, the number one buffet in Singapore right now.  It is located inside the Ritz Carlton.  I think it came out to about $70~$80 US Dollars.  Make a reservation online in order to get in (do in advance by a few weeks).

Seating and Dining Area was beautiful.  Definitely a bit more luxurious looking inside than that of any Vegas buffet. 

There are a few stations.  I believe there is a staggered rush, but only turn the tables over only once maybe.  The seafood area is the closest and is in the center of the dining area.  There are delicious and huge fresh prawns, crawfish, clams, mussels, some small snow crab claws, and some super tasty oysters from Japan.  There's then a sushi area that has some pretty tasty salmon sashimi and a few other assorted sushis.  This gets super packed with people wanting to try the seafood first. 

Then there's a ""u-shaped"" back area behind the seafood that has a ""roasted meats stall"" that is very decorative, as they have a display case and everything.  There's also a pasta station - which makes a pretty good seafood miso carbonara (pretty uniquely tasty).  The western area isn't very good imho.  The indian station is decent, and someone is making fresh naans.  The singaporean/asian area was good -- they have chili crab, which is made with soft shell crab.  The noodle station was good , with plenty of tasty prawns in it. The guy working was also super nice. Then there's a dim sum area.

Drink wise, there are some juices (nothing special, coming out of a box and poured into the cups), along with some desserts.   There's a dessert station near the front which had a lot of good stuff from local kuey to macaroons. 

Give it a try if you're in SG.  A good variety of stuff , high quality, and has a good balance of SG classics and non Singaporean stuff.",5,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fecMex2wFxwN8216WCM_ZA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ed_xA-hrdw24wlQb4M0zgQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4QoJeVTKSVgVuuZb6cFNsw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RAgy_0IxXi-oHk1ybm8j_A/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/imovTPirs8BqVTNIIhh3ZA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/h6UBz7ZxaGa5iGJiTrItoA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mSIPQpD1tBhlSy60kl65iQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8W9sKuVLxbXOWsWBwdBrfA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vKh8mIqK2hUMiSo6zZEmdg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2Jq42gyfPw4A8nxAgxO5lA/o.jpg,,Food & Beverage

Colony,Nick S.,17/1/2019,"I used to like to go to Ritz Carlton's Colony restaurant for its buffet. We went to colony this Monday. The restaurant was not full house though. However we were given a make shift squeezed table of Five by a service staff Nina. At first she refused to change table for us, saying that the table is ok with 5 people and the restaurant was fully booked. We told her to call for the manager,then she agree to change to another proper table for 5 persons.                                                                     The food in the Colony is getting very boring with declining quality. The Japanese counter sashimi and sushi are the standard offerings with no creativity. The color and presentation of food were not attractive. The worst is at the Chinese counter. The dim sum was terrible with no quality control. The texture of dim sum was either rubbery and the Sui Mai texture was soft and starchy with no prawn and meat texture. The Laksa noodles gravy does not taste like Laksa at all. The gravy was over cooked with a burnt taste.                                      The dessert counter was boring and there were no outstanding desserts at all. Just average quality with variety. I was not even tempted to take any dessert when I pass by the dessert counter.                                                           
Service was excellent apart from the Host blunder in table assignment.                                                       I realized nowadays 6stars hotel like Ritz Carlton, Fullerton, due to their reputation and good business , have ignored their initial brand promise to customers. They are sitting on their laurels because the numbers are good and get carried away with food quality and presentation of food. No use of providing wide variety of food, if as a six star hotel restaurants is unable to deliver a 6star professional attitude towards its operations in quality, presentation and innovation of the food offerings to your customers! I realized the so called 6 star hotel restaurants in Singapore cannot be compared with those in Thailand and Hong Kong! The owners of 6 star hotels needs to shake up the hotel management staff and constantly keep them in checked to deliver the brand promise and commitment to their customers !",2,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FC-Cq7-D6i87bJji1EBltw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iwBchjTP_qYix6Qyui7ecQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zxdhMhBOjbTdZF9SNY9Y2A/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/T5boK6DCUagnd193LFiFdg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CwtwQPvhZtKoO0QpOp1E-w/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4FggAvSR411kuDBPmWAmwA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2sI1Y2fmGOhMByEeByO5_Q/o.jpg,,Food & Beverage

Colony,Todd W.,2/6/2016,"This is a review for a Sunday buffet brunch at Colony restaurant, main level of the Ritz Carlton. Formerly branded as the Greenhouse, the Ritz has put much thought and effort into reorganizing the buffet areas into a more consolidated and efficient operation. They've also changed the feel of the dining room by adding partition walls that display framed stock photos all with the theme: colonization.

The effect of the heavily used partition wall modules is that of a Pottery Barn store. The feel is that all of the framed photos are on display to sell. The only thing missing are the price tags. The Wall Modules break up the large space creating a more intimate dining experience. What is lost is the joy of people watching during the brunch. With the serving stations all moved to a remote (mostly hidden) location at the rear of the restaurant and the partition walls segmenting the space into smaller dining areas, the feel is not as good as the Greenhouse. 

The wide spectrum of food offerings are enough to please any palette. Local, Indian, Western, Seafood, Cheese, Breads, Desserts, etc. In addition to the free flow champagne, bartenders are on duty to make Bloody Marys and Espresso Martinis. I had several of each and both were delicious.

The staff is friendly, well trained and attentive. Champagne glasses were always kept full, empty plates continually cleared, and Bloody Marys and Martinis delivered upon request. 

The Good: Food Quality, Staff, Ambiance

The Bad: I'm not a fan of the maze-like new partition wall modules that detract from the grand architectural space and prefer the more open and spacious feel of the Greenhouse. Hands down, the Greenhouse was a much better brunch experience.

The Verdict: Colony is a prime player in the Singapore Sunday Brunch scene. Glad to have visited, but I think I'll wait for the bi-annual ""Super Brunch"" before returning.",4,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,,,Food & Beverage

Paulaner Bräuhaus Singapore,Joey M.,21/8/2012,"Working through a tumultuous week can result in voracious appetites for freedom and stacks, and stacks of food by the time the weekend rolls in. If this is what you're feeling on a Sunday morning, Paulaner Brauhaus fits your demands to a T.

Step in and be amazed at their triple storey restaurant that includes a bar and a brewery and an outdoors corner for those who like to bask in the sun on Sundays... but patrons flock here by the dozens for their fill of authentic Bavarian food fare.

When one thinks of German food, bratwursts and pickles come to mind. You won't find many pickles, but sausages, you will find, in plain bounty. Meet the juiciest sausages you'll have the greatest pleasure of eating, the Thüringer, (Cheese, and without), Debreziener, and Nürnberger. Slap on some authentic German mustard made with freshy ground mustard seed to balance the savouriness with some zest, or drench your bratwurst in curry sauce, and enjoy.

Don't get too full on the sausages though. There's always room for their crispy pork knuckles. As big as two of your fists put together, this culinary delight is sure to send your taste buds into overdrive. Sink your teeth into the tenderness of the knuckles and be delighted by the unexpected juiciness that squirts out of the flesh.

Wash everything down with a mug of beer straight from their brewery and please don't be afraid to let out a belch - that's your stomach thanking you for all that food, glorious food.",4,restaurants; nightlife,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EYJvHSUnGo5yMqTA_kLFYQ/o.jpg,Sausages galore!,Food & Beverage

The kitchen is glacially slow.  The servers will bring you your food, then disappear without ever giving you the fork you may want to use to eat it with.  Want mustard with your pretzel?  You'll have to go up to the bar later and ask for some.  How many times do you have to ask for plates?  

I feel quite hopeful that they'll get their act together, but for now, bring your patience when you visit... and as long as you have a good sense of humor about it, you'll almost certainly still have a good time.

Food is hearty and usually comes is large portions, ordered their German twist on pizza one time bcos the sausages were just too much meat without starch and it turned out to be this large and rich concoction which was tasty but me & wife had a tough time finishing it...

The codfish is small but the side dishes make it filling.

I'm usually good with a pint (0.5l) of the draught pale lager, which is light and goes down easy. If you're feeling a little full, they have them in 0.3l mugs as well (which are so cute!) or if you're thirsty, go for the 1l!

The pretzel tastes like the kind you buy in the freezer section and reheat in a microwave. Don't waste your money on that.

Due to our short visit, we only got drinks, but I did see a good amount of people with food, although it seems like from the other reviews on here, that was the establishment's downfall.

- PARKING -
I believe there was a mall parking structure nearby, but we took ride shares that dropped us off right in front of the restaurant.

- SERVICE/ENVIRONMENT -
We got seated immediately, and in the beginning the staff was very attentive. However this definitely dropped off towards the end, when we were trying to order an additional drink and also when trying to get the check to leave.

- DRINKS -
Lycheetini ($18.00): Exactly what it sounds like. I'm not a huge alcoholic drinker, so the fact this wasn't overpowering straight up liquor was a good thing for me. Nice taste of Lychee but not juice either!

The Hugo ($17.00): This was a hit for our group - everyone enjoyed sips of this and was the drink that we tried to order more of! Really nice balance of flavors!

The most shocking offering was the boiled pork knuckle. Although a fairly popular dish in Singapore, the boiled version is not for the faint of heart. Everything else was decently made and served.

Paulaner Bräuhaus Singapore,Pui Yeng C.,3/8/2012,"An old secondary school friend recently suggested this popular German microbrewery bar for our quarterly meet-up; which includes lots of girl-talk, tooth-achingly sweet desserts and most importantly, rich and creamy golden goodness in the form of beer. 

Patrons can opt for private high-stool booths indoors as well as an alfresco style balcony on the second level. There was plenty of room for a gathering of friends, and also a romantic back-drop complete with the Singapore Flyer for couples on a date. 

I would personally suggest getting a seat early in the evening before the night crowd swarms, and getting their signature Munich lager straight away to take advantage of their 1-for-1 beers between 12 to 8pm. Their fried Pork Knuckles was a heart-attack-sized platter of melt in your mouth meat, with a side of buttery German mashed potato. Don't forget their specialty of grilled sausages - the best way to try them all would be the Paulaner Sausage Pan, which features 5 of their top picks in a single platter. Finish it off with Caramelized Bavarian Emperor's Pancake, with warm fluffy chunks of buttered batter coated in crispy sugar, served with caramelized apple sauce; every sugar-high-junkie's dream! 

Being stuffed as we were, it's best to get the chit chat out of the way by 9 and enjoy as their live band gets on stage to croon their way through jazzy and country numbers, with a song request segment after each set.  A cheeky request of the popular radio anthem 'We Are Young' was gamely attempted by the guitar-strumming uncles, to much applause and appreciative sing-along, making it the perfect rowdy end to a cozy night out.",5,restaurants; nightlife,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xl9WLZ8dXhSQVMPBfffqSw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/L5l-8bQ0hgjhBXoukYyvgg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Zd5Qmb3aEXuw7lj3zxjH2A/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RCTutWehnTgZa7HJMeXRMg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QDX7jyqIaLqvjcQu0cCLEQ/o.jpg,Live band takes the stage!; Pork Knuckle; Caramelized Pancake,Food & Beverage

Other than that, the food is almost more than the real thing: the pork legs are twice the size of those in Germany, and even my Zürcher Geschnetzeltes (difficult to find anything not Gerrman on the menu!) was made with bacon.

Salt Grill & Sky Bar,Miguel M.,11/10/2014,"If you want to score, this is the place to bring your wife or girlfriend! Salt Grill oozes with sex appeal. You enter the restaurant through a welcome area on the 4th floor of ION and through a special elevator bank behind the art gallery. Once you reach the top floor, you are greeted by a beautiful dining space and jaw dropping views of Singapore.

Making a reservation is a must, especially if you want to secure a spot with one of the limited tables that line glass viewing area.

Our order included: raw oysters, glass Sydney crab omelette, rocket salad, and bone-in ribeye steak for two. The glass Sydney Crab Omelette was a definite winner and is a must have appetizer. The Rocket Salad with blue cheese, pear and candied walnuts is a great choice for anyone in the mood for a refreshing salad.

The clear highlight for me was without question the Bone-in Rib Eye. The steak was juicy, perfectly cooked, and mouth watering. However, I'm a fanatic of steaks that are juicy on the inside and crisp on the outside (Heston Blumenthal way of cooking steak). Don't get me wrong, Salt grill delivers a damn good steak, but I can't give it the ""best in Singapore"" designation. The restaurant was also nice enough to alter my sides from mash potatoes to roasted garlic mushrooms, free of charge.

Overall, Salt is a wonderful restaurant and is among the very best in Singapore. 5 stars for the ambience and breathtaking views and 4 stars for the food.",4,restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/o4Tzh57XQocg8k794t88Pg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ehKh1ZztEYiO-FtxfYBr_Q/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/l0gxf_pfDwDv7O9WSHr_jg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-HYQ3gV8iiX6ey1y75cJBg/o.jpg,Set of six oysters with the Singapore skyline in the background.; Amazing views of SG; Ribeye steak for two.; Happy birthday chocolate soufflé for my beautiful wife.,Food & Beverage
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,Anna S.,15/1/2019,"Experience: I went here for my birthday and loved it. They had such tasty cocktails and great cuts of meat, which they brought out to show us and explain each cut. Since we came for my birthday, they also had the option to leave a birthday message on the dessert we ordered. When we ordered a black coffee and they brought a cappuccino, I let them know so that they could exchange it and they took it off the bill altogether. They are clearly very eager to please. 

Environment: Clearly a fine dining place. They have a walkway along a wall of windows where you can look out at all the places in Singapore. The windows are marked with small signs noting what part of the city it is (chinatown, downtown, etc). 

Food: The steak was so good. I got the flat iron which was known for its high marbling rating (I think it was 6-7+), but you can always ask them there for more details. All of the sides were good too, but the main dishes that stuck out were the steaks and the desserts: the pavlova was delicious, and such a hard dessert to get right. 

Price: It's a nice place to be prepared to pay top dollar. Steaks are anywhere for $60-$100+ and even a cocktail is $20-$25. I'm sure you can get other dishes not quite as expensive as the steaks, but I think that is the main appeal of a nice place like this. 

Service: Fantastic, but a little slow towards the end (when we ordered small things like coffee to finish off the meal).",5,restaurants; restaurants,,,Food & Beverage
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,Zed Z.,20/4/2018,"The obvious wow factor for this place is the sweeping view. We went to dinner and had unfettered view of the Singapore skyline - that was remarkable. 

The food is generally good, with some misses. We did not care about the crab omelette that came highly recommended. But the Bungalow pork and octopus were both great starters. For mains, the sirloin was overly crusted but was good. Grilled asparagus on the side was also very good. I would rate the food a solid 3.5-stars but pushed it up to four for the excellent wine recommendation. 

Service here is strange. The disposition of the staff is wonderful. They are all friendly without being patronising. But there were service lapses. For example, we ordered three starters. Two were served together, then there was a 45-minute wait before the third one arrived.

Salt Grill & Sky Bar,Raymond L.,8/8/2012,"Oh my gawd, where do I even start? Let's start with the view! Located right on top of ION Orchard, the restaurant gives you a fantastic visual treat of the city, whether night or day.

The food is supposedly ""Modern Australian"", but you don't have to care what it's called, just know that it's marvellously good. All the ingredients are fresh, the dishes unique and the presentation impeccable.

And no wonder: it's opened by celebrity chef Luke Mangan and there are only seven of such restaurants worldwide (although one of his proteges have taken over the running of the Singapore branch). 

I had the Maori Lakes beef tenderloin, which is so good my vocabulary fails me. The Barramundi fillet is also fantastic, but not everybody will like the sauce it comes in. And if you love sashimi, you have to try their version!

For dessert, you must try the chocolate mousse. You'll regret it for the rest of your life if you don't!

Salt Grill & Sky Bar,Alyssa Chloe T.,6/2/2017,"I've been dying to try this place for a while now, mainly because I love steak & was curious about the 56th floor of ion. So when the fiancé brought me here for my birthday, I was really excited. 

They do have a wide array of cuts, and I loved that they brought over a giant platter and explained which cut was served for each dish. It made it easier to chose. Their meat was pretty good, though mine was a little over (asked for rare, but it was closer to medium rare/medium). Their red wine sauce was really good though! 

Francis and I were a little over ambitious and thought we could finish a side of asparagus, oyster mushrooms, and onsen egg, but we couldn't. This side dish did taste a little strange though, still can't figure out why I didn't like it that much. 

Dessert was average, the chocolate lava cake was slightly over baked so it didn't ooze out nicely.

Salt Grill & Sky Bar,Angeline C.,11/1/2013,"Confronted by the capturing city skyline, I grew vulnerable at an instant. The breathtaking environ is uncontested, it is no wonder that others called it a romantic spot - I wouldn't refuse such claim. I often get bewitched by the apparent horizon at BLU, I have thought that was the most friendly distance with the clouds until the restaurant was shut last June. While seeing people displaying their portraits taken against the limitless blue plane on various social media platforms, I have secretly bookmarked the place even when there's nothing much to brag about on the food.

Located on the 56th floor at the iconic Ion shopping mall, one has to make his way to level 4 where he will be greeted by a Salt representative at the concierge counter before being transported to the restaurant in a private lift. Clad in stylish layout, pressed table cloth draping the well-aligned tables that sits under the tall ceiling, the space looks so accommodating. The sky bar adjoins Ion's observatory deck will open at dinner time, sets the mood for some romantic engagement. Even if you don't get to sit at the bar during the day, you could walk to the observatory deck for a 360degree view of the city landscape before getting yourself chained to the seat. The service staff are polite and sensitive to your needs. Undeniably knowledgeable on the food composite when I throw questions at her except a fair-skinned white macho who expressed disapproving frown when was told that the asparagus tasted weak under the strong blower in the restaurant.

I was nonetheless impressed with the Fig Tart but less with the crab omelette that many raved about. The brutal kind of tart that you must have, absolutely regrettable if you missed. Get ready to be charmed by that utmost thin and flaky puff pastry - resembles someone with bloated tummy, it was filled with airy compartments packed with overlapping pastry layers that was buttery and so brittle. The sweetness in the fig plus the caramelised onion adds sharp flavour to the puff, together with a smack drizzle of acidic verjuice. I liked the fact that they have been less generous with the blue cheese stuck between the figs and softened onions which may otherwise oust the celestial fit in the dish.

Most people will look for a robust egg dish that is almost always moist, tender yet with a sturdy structure. The Sydney crab omelette met the minimum - not overly cooked (though it could be better if it had been custardy) to hold up the hearty crab filling but taste flat. The spotless golden-yellow structure centred with simple embellishments was seen mediating in the miso broth with a zen outlook.

I chose the asparagus with confit eschallot. I couldn't stressed this much that it looked as if it was a cold dish to me. Others might find the dish positive but it seems less conclusive for me. The crunchy stems were cold and although the shallot confit adds slight flavour, I leave the dish unconsidered.

For the mains, the char grilled corn fed baby chicken fared sumptuously. Endless enjoyment to bits!! Instead of rubbery skin, it turn out thin crisps, splotched by a wider char surface. I love its smokey flavour that scent the fork-tendered juicy meat. While I enjoyed the well-seasoned juvenile drumsticks, I am more fond of the moisture trapped within the succulent meat space! And if you have not eaten a cauliflower puree, this is the time. The whitish pool of creamy cooked texture was laced with some lemon notes which brings out its dedicate flavour. With less added dairy, the puree retained its light fresher taste.

Guaranteeing the best beef from the Northwest of Tasmania, Australia; the Cape Grim has a pronounced wild taste in the meat. Claiming the Australia's finest hormone and GMO-free grass fed beef, it has been well sought after by top chefs world-widely. Going for medium rare preparation, the brownish exterior charred by flat iron encasing the pinkish marbled meat was somewhat appealing. The crust hasn't had the satisfactory bite but the meat texture was tender with a bit of chew. Smudge each piece in the tangy yet pungent verde sauce with tons of flavours coming from chopped parsley, basil, capers and garlic, for very acute taste. 

The greatest letdown was the Chocolate Soufflé which arrived with sheer dampness that I can't live in contention. Yes, it was baked airy in a milder chocolate note but it was all WATERY in the centre, and right to the base!! It seems like alien to me and so I have to summon my genuine feedback when someone came forward to clear my table. 

Chocolate Three Ways; the chocolate fondant cake has graced the dessert moment with lingering deep bitter flavour emitting from the moist cocoa sponge. The sweet-toothed wouldn't fancy this but they may find the milk Mars bar a bit more attractive. These desserts didn't quite complete my meal, less memorable. So, if I were to encode anything from Salt, it has to be the splendid horizon plus the entrée.",4,restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wPoXAVnKo1fNmXgsiMRk0g/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xqqhiBFJMrjvXwyNHNYkyQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PNUA1pnV8mMUVnMvxoh6bg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1pE8GUt7f4w5TApnpQY7ww/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tR_AoREcmMdbU4jZ5qMsgA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/61woD6ozqwstbjm8FcmalA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cvUrWxeN0wJn4f1j9ophSg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/byf8N4Wn24xqg2X9n11e5A/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nZ7vXH5bEgMBBderTA_UrA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0JvtXBsRChkQUGKy2RRKgQ/o.jpg,"Salt Grill & Sky Bar @level 56; Swanky interior; Menu; Sky bar; Complimentary bread ""platter""; Thick slices - hard to resist!; Incredible spiced nuts to top it up..",Food & Beverage
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,Big R.,12/2/2013,"Salt Grill & Sky Bar offers decent food and decent service in an attractive venue with an exceptional view.  The venue and view lived up to expectations.  The food and service, unfortunately, only lived up to the rather low standards I have come to expect from restaurants on the top floor of tall buildings.  Don't get me wrong about this.  Their food and service were not bad at all but I was hoping for better.  

Next time I want to treat guests to a nice view, I will take them to the Singapore Flyer and then take them to dinner at a great restaurant at ground level that can successfully compete based on the quality of its food rather than its views.

By the way, don't waste your money on the Spanish Ortiz anchovy appetizer.  The menu accurately states on that the anchovies are served in the tin with garlic bread but I assumed there would be some creativity involved.  There wasn't. Just an open tin of anchovies and some garlic bread.

Salt Grill & Sky Bar,Mark D.,9/12/2012,"This is a review of a Friday evening dinner date at Salt grill and Sky bar.

I have to admit the view is pretty spectacular.  Well, if you like urban skylines (I do), it is.

I was late.  My date was even later.  The staff made no mention of this.

The room is a very well appointed.  It is an impressive space with both modern and classic touches.  There is a large glass roof.  It truly hearkens to my expectations of traditional white-tablecloth fine-dining.  

I was surprised that the restaurant was only halfway full.  It is a very quiet and restrained restaurant.  The staff even sings ""Happy Birthday"" in a barely audible tone.

This continues to spill over into the service.  This is professional and polite.  It is reserved.  It is attentive.  There isn't any unnecessary chit-chat. 

The service was impeccable.  It was timely.  The staff was there when they should be.  The server was knowledgeable.  This is the very essence of fine dining service.  The meal was also well-paced.

This was the first restaurant I've visited in Singapore that offered a complimentary glass of champagne to start the meal.  

The food ranged from good to extremely good.  The presentation of each dish was another classic touch.  They were beautifully plated without giving into to being overly showy.

Complimentary Bread - A very nice fresh bread was provided.  It was served with olive oil and a mixture of high quality salt to dip it in.  When she quickly answered no to ""would you like more bread"", my dinner companion saved me from my own appetite.

http://tinyurl.com/c2wjy4n

Scallop raviolo in squid ink pasta, spiced tomato consomme, corn puree - I only had one bite of this.  It ended up squarely in front of my date.  It was very rich.  If they provided this as a main dish, I could easily order it.  For me, all of the ingredients worked well together.  I do not have a photo of this dish.

Roasted cherry tomatoes, Burrata cheese, peppers, grilled bread - This was extremely good.  It came close to allowing the red peppers to dominate.  But the creaminess of the Burrata and the sweetness of the roasted tomatoes helped to keep them in check.  The bread was grilled perfectly to hold the dish together.

http://tinyurl.com/akv3ufg

Duck sliders, pickled spring onion, cucumber - These were very good.  If I had my choice, I would probably have selected a high quality Western style bun over the more Asian style presentation.  Excluding the ""bun"", the ingredients provided an almost bahn mi experience.  

http://tinyurl.com/catdjll

Lamb cutlets Maori Lakes New Zealand, Provencal herbs - My friend ordered the lamb.  She was kind  enough to share a bite.  It was very good.  The balance of the flavour of the lamb was perfect for my own personal taste.  She seemed to enjoy it also.

http://tinyurl.com/azdxbho

Corn fed Spatchcock, Cajun and herb spices - I am not quite sure what made this dish a spatchcock, a cooking term for removing the main two bones and cooking the chicken flat.  I am also not sure what made it cajun.  It was certainly too mild to be considered Cajun.  However, it was extremely good.  The chicken was moist and tender.  While not particularly Cajun, the spices came together very well.  In finer restaurants, I seldom order chicken.  I am glad I tried theirs.  It was some of the best chicken I've had in quite awhile.

http://tinyurl.com/aou4p6q

We had sides of truffled mashed potato and roasted mushrooms.  Each of these were prepared in a very traditional manner.  They both served as comfortable compliments to our main dishes.

Pear Torte - This was her selected dessert.  I tried it.  I would have preferred the pear to be a little softer.  Plus, the pear tasted more like an an apple to me.  But, it was a nice dessert.

http://tinyurl.com/b2hamn8

Crème brûlée with salted caramel ice cream - This was not a traditional crème brûlée.  There was no hard carmelized layer to crack through.  For me, this dessert was more about the combination of ingredients with the ice cream as the anchor of the dish.  I thought it was a great way to end the meal.

Throughout writing this review, I mentally debated four stars or five stars. A part of me thought the food fell just slightly short.  Another part thought the enjoyment of the experience was slightly diminished by the fact the room was not nearly full.

Salt Grill & Sky Bar,Doreen T.,28/12/2015,"I had been to this restaurant a number of times, but this was the first I was coming for afternoon tea. The Afternoon Tea Platter costs $38++ per person, inclusive of a tea or coffee, or $53++ per person including a glass of G.H Mumm Champagne. It is available from 2.30pm to 4:45pm. The coffee is non refillable, while as for tea one could ask for refillable of hot water.

The afternoon tea platter consisted of 
Crostini, avocado, cherry tomato, olive,

Smoked salmon, cucumber, chive, crème cheese on rye,
Chocolate & jam lamington,
Coffee macaroon,
Tim tam chocolate tart,
Red velvet cup cake,

The tea set was nicely plated but I felt that it was a bit too overpriced for such little food. May I was expecting much more from this price. The Citrus marshmallow is my favourite as it had a rather zesty taste which peaked one up. The rest were not bad too.

I had requested for a table by the window through online reservation, but was showed to a table by the frosted window with no view of the outside. Not sure if it was due to the fact that I was having a 3 years old boy with me at the time. We were seated far away from other customers and had difficulties getting the attention of the staff. As it was between lunch and dinner meal times, there was limited choices for a 3 years old. No children menu, so ended up ordering French fries ($11++) for him. Total bill for the fries was $12.95.",3,restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tgBqnCRDUx_DYYOAb9Fz-w/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/15VqkeEOKXU4885hn6pscw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/F2bM5K_kTkIN9U9UIRC2LA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Obfz-EbdhB4maxCANhml5g/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/B8dti7h7z7WEelQO2ipCnQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/en-hwE89V_CF-Tse-pnUSg/o.jpg,Afternoon Tea Platter; French Fries; Afternoon Tea Platter,Food & Beverage
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,Mike C.,14/8/2017,"The food wasn't memorable or anything. I opted with the tasting menu so I can at least enjoy the scenic views a little bit longer, but I soon realized halfway into the tasting menu, that I just wanted to leave. 

The food wasn't bad, but this was no fine dining. The dessert which was the apple and liquorice cream was the only decent thing from the menu.

So lesson learned...if you visit Salt Grill, stick with the regular menu, or just hang out at the bar and order at least $80 worth of drinks since that's the minimum amount to hang out here. But it will probably only take you 2-3 drinks to get to this amount since cocktails will run around $25 a drink.

Views are great though.",3,restaurants; restaurants,,,Food & Beverage
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,Carolyn L.,21/3/2013,"Restaurant Week lunch. I have always wanted to try the food at Salt Grill & Sky Bar but it is always full during restaurant week, well, except for this week. 

Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 stars: 
The experience was marred from the beginning when I saw the email on Tuesday (they sent it Sunday afternoon, but I didn't check email till Tuesday...some people are not chained by email :p) where it asked if I could change my dining time to 11.30 am or 11.45 am instead of 12 pm. The reason was due to the overwhelming response and so we will only have 1 hour 15 mins to dine if we come at 12 pm.

The question that pop into my head was ""didn't they already have a fix number of tables for Restaurant Week""? and ""Why was this not indicated when making the booking?"" And this was not the first time Salt has participated in Restaurant Week, wouldn't they have known better on what to expect?

It is quite disconcerting to have to re-arrange our schedule just so we will not have a rushed lunch. In any case, we decided to change our reservations to 11.30 am. I got there just before 11.30 am and was told the restaurant was not ready as the staff are getting their briefing then. 2nd strike. I made the effort to be on time, and at the time suggested by the restaurant, I would expect to be granted the courtesy to be seated accordingly. Cooling my heels for a while, it was another 5-10 minutes later before I was finally shown to a table. 

The ""3rd"" not so happy experience was very minor - I asked for a window table but I was told it was for non-restaurant week customers...that reason did not fly with me as a friend had the window table the day before and she was also dining on Restaurant Week menu. Anyway, that was really a minor thing but the whole pre-dining experience was enough to make me put Salt on the ""first and last time"" dining list. 


Back to the place and food:

I like the simplicity of the place with its high ceiling and modern furnishing. Service was professional, attentive, polite and not overly friendly. What caught me by surprise was the basket the manager brought over for us to put our bags. That was thoughtful. 

Water was topped up without having to ask (they do ask if you want still or sparkling water, but you could request for warm or iced tap water at no extra cost), the courses were well paced  so we did not feel rushed. In the end we left slightly after 1.15 pm, but never once were we made to feel we had to hurry through the meal. So kudos to the service staff for making the actual dining experience to be enjoyable after all.

Restaurant Week Menu:
Starter - chicken liver foie gras parfait, truffled butter, toasted brioche. This was really superb. A generous serving of smooth pate in a small jar which went very well with the brioche and complimentary bread 

Main - Maori lakes tenderloin, blue cheese pressed potato, spinach and red wine jus. I asked for medium and it was done just right, not too bloody with a bit of pink in the center. The meat was just so tender and juicy (still cannot compare to American beef in flavor) that it was with sadness when I popped in the last bite. I wished it was a bigger portion. Just have to come back next time for the 200 gm served in the ala carte menu. The pressed potato (in thin slices) with blue cheese was ok, just a hint of blue cheese so those who do not like it will not be turned off by it. 

Dessert - tasting platter 
Creme Brulee with salted caramel ice cream - my favorite of the lot. Creamy custard covered with the sugar glaze and topped with salted caramel ice cream. There were also chocolate pearls hidden giving it a nice crunch.

Chocolate bar - surprisingly I did not find it that great. There were some wafer bits which tasted a bit soft, not crispy at all. 

Licorice ice cream with lime and sago - never a big fan of licorice though the lime did give it a bit of contrasting flavor and made it more palatable to me.

Coffee was normal. You could select the tea of your choice, you just have to ask them what is available. 

So yes, I would want to go back again, just to have the tenderloin and for the view. It is a very nice view and will probably be fantastic to dine in the evening to see the sunset.

NOTE: To get there, you need to turn right and right and left (when you see the TV) to get to the elevator to Salt Grill. It can get a tad confusing and dark to find.",4,restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/S4mM7hUjRMhS3_LCVVKmFg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/k0FH0v5gzkM9bouCyHWR4w/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UxtHXfu4j1PM8-EBM0S8xA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fCK71a_liXrRMS8nPEwN2Q/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yuwHyk6XK0UQ18usQXbTVw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1G7CLGBnGuQ91ApW-mQy1Q/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sIjqqS6dtBLn4XAiFCyKlQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MocME4wk14lwt47S6esfkw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/F6kpoKnOF8FrvHHbeJ7vjw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RWUG1N9KpE5ZiZ2mxwlV8g/o.jpg,"Restaurant Week menu; Chicken liver foie gras; chicken liver foie gras, truffled butter and toasted brioche.

Salt Grill & Sky Bar,Angie K.,12/2/2016,"Wow. a totally unexpected surprise. We've been meaning to check this place out for awhile bc of its great view from the 50th+ storey of Ion Orchard, but kept postponing our visit bc we were told from friends that the food is not worth it. You are basically paying for the view, they'd say. But we decided to finally try it out on a random Sunday lunch, and ultimately and surprisingly had one of the most satisfying dining experience in Sing. 

1. The service was perfect. From the moment we walked in, we were pleasantly greeted and escorted to one of the many seats next to the windows for the perfect view and we were able to see our condo from our seat! the kind and attentive waiter really knew his menu and was always readily available. 
3. The lunch set menu was so much cheaper than we expected, at $49 for 3 courses including tea or coffee. what a bargain, considering the location and the fact that the dishes mimicked that of dishes at fine dining, or were even better. 
4. the dishes were so delicious! to start, they gave us complimentary radish snack with homemade potato chips.

for Entree, we got:
-'Glass' Sydney crab omelette in miso mustard broth, their signature dish which was okay for me, but D loved it. 
-Baked bone marrow, onion, watercress, and garlic toast.   this is the entree to get. bone marrow was the best I've tried in a long time! It was prepared in such a way that I've never tried before, drenched in garlic and other sauces, and it was just perfection with the garlic toast pairing.

Main course:
-Seared Blue Fin tuna, potato, pimento, softquail egg, olives & anchovies dressing:  never thought i'd write a comment on an egg, but i've never tried an egg that was cooked So perfectly that it's bouncy yet so soft.  tuna and all the ingredients came together so well.
-Goats cheese gnocchi, beets, vincotto, burnt butter dressing, pistachio, raisons: again, the ingredients in the dish came together so well, that we were forking everything together in one-bite to experience the bursting of flavors. it was perfect. 

dessert:
we got the sorbet, crumbs and berries and dessert of the day which was a winner. 

We exited the restaurant as if we paid over $200 for the service, location, and the amazing food, when it was around $110 altogether. Why didn't we come sooner? it's a perfect place for dates, girl dates, and for visitors as well!",5,restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tT3lf9_QIcRimX3vctPmPA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XfPJ5BtAVnmm0FB8teGWag/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wgNyqmvIfISrkHIPZnPi_A/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VmafU4b2G-m7qZ2uh2P0IA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6B2bKU51841t5RdHSSdrPg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hRyRIdAVEalymi8w3hrnSQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OD37yi5rV2ztdxKHW-s5Vw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/isheAXFaBcawrqxQ1Axzlg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oCiRF8Xx30AV-yNblslhXw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fFzj3NWCMq6rI8hlMPbGLA/o.jpg,,Food & Beverage
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,Michelle M.,30/7/2014,"My husband and I recently celebrated my birthday here, and I had a wonderful time! (I say ""I"" because I stuck him with the bill at the end of the night!)

Salt Grill is an awesome place for a special occasion dinner, and I also agree with the other reviewers who say it's a good venue for treating out your parental units.

To get there, head to the concierge at the 4th floor of Ion. Walk around the desk and you'll see the welcome area for Salt. Someone will guide you to the special elevator bank that will whisk you up to the 55th floor.

Walking into the main dining room, your breath will be taken away by the lovely views of Singapore. I'm glad we went here for dinner because I enjoyed watching the city light up and transition from early evening to dusk.

To start, we ordered the oysters (served natural), and the 'glass' Sydney crab omelette. I can't comment on the oysters as I'm allergic, but I will say the Sydney crab omelette was a-ok. I know people rave about it, but it's simply not my type of dish.

However, I really loved our main. We did the meat cut for two, which changes daily. That day, it was a bone-in ribeye. It came with onion rings, a rocket salad, and mash. Miguel doesn't like potatoes much, so we asked if we could replace the mash with the roast garlic mushrooms and luckily they obliged.

The rocket salad was my type of salad: blue cheese, pear, and candied walnuts. All so good! The steak was juicy and I loved the horseradish/pepper jus that it was drenched in. Throw in a decent bottle of wine (we decided on a cab sauv from California) and we were in heaven. 

For a moment, I was worried because the table next to us brought a baby with them... but thankfully the baby was quiet and didn't disturb our dinner. Overall, the ambiance was set nicely with the dim lighting and bossa nova soundtrack in the background. The service was impeccable and we didn't feel rushed at all throughout the evening. If you're feelin' spendy, this is a great option to consider. :)",5,restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ycgJmtbrmdNRxP0Rnq7SPQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vefy1ql41OrP6o76HoQ8PA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/E9GX_U3b9qxqbVbDCvp1bw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1KaOZuXiIOp05KzJWYsX9A/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/D4thTICSAb0OXHWAxdF3Gg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zC4Rt8uyZWP1If1dk1kTAg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RGJwcCSXbKCUMuP5hndUtw/o.jpg,"View of Tanglin from our table, around 7:30 PM; Complimentary starter; Oysters served natural with a vinegar-y sauce; 'glass' Sydney crab omelette in the spotlight; Meat for two, that night it was a bone-in ribeye.

Salt Grill & Sky Bar,Nik T.,11/10/2012,"third restaurant week date in a row!

for the uninitiated, you need to head to the 4th floor of ion, where the visitor's info booth is.
their reception is co located there.
they will then show you the way to a separate lift to the premises.
they open at 6pm sharp, so even if you are early you cant get in.

this is definitely a date impressing kind of place.
the view reminds me of equinox and jaan.

this is the most expensive of the restaurant week menu priced at $55.
so in effect you are probably paying $20 for the view?

the restaurant week set dinner is made up of 3 courses:

for the first course, we had the 'glass' Sydney crab omelette, miso mustard broth.
nice flavour from the crab as well as the mild miso mustard broth.
lots of garnishing on top which can be a nightmare for some.

for the main, the spatchcock is highly recommended.
a juvenile chicken butterflied for faster cooking.
it was very well seasoned and cooked to perfection.
tender to the fork and juicy in the mouth.
the grape and currant dressing gave the dish a sweet edge.
the parsnip mash is also a nice change from the usual mash that we get.

for dessert, you get a liquorice parfait in lime jus.
can sound foul to some, including myself, who is not a fan of liquorice.
but to my utter surprise, i was won over and really enjoyed it!
the liquorice was used in moderation.
and it was cleverly musked by the fresh lime juice, zest and lime fruit slices.
you still get an after taste of liquorice but not a strong lingering one.
pieces of thin biscuit wafer were delightfully crisp and buttery.

the coffee that came with the set was sad!
i guess i am comparing it to the one i had at latteria which was awesome.
one sip and i abandoned ship.
maybe it would be safer for you to go with their tea instead.

if you would like wine to accompany your meal, they do have 2 special offer for restaurant week.
however, we chose to go with the luke mangan's red and white wine by the glass in their ala carte menu.

now for the ala carte orders:

i started with the Fig tart with caramelized onion and blue cheese, verjuice
dressing.
the waiter duly reminded that it will take 12 mins to prepare this dish.
must be really good then!:)
it did not disappoint.
the figs could be sweeter though.
a thin pastry base topped with caramelized onions then round flat slices of fresh figs and finally some melted blue cheese and some sprouts.
again the blue cheese may not go well with some, but i liked it.

for mains, i had the Scotch 250g Rangers Valley VIC 300 days grain fed.
grilled to medium and served on a bed of french beans with red wine jus.
i had the english mustard and horse radish on the side.
the beef was not spectacular.
cooked as requested but only average in flavour.
priced at $75, again you must be paying $20 for the view?

we also ordered a side of Broccolini with confit eschallot.
i must say they do their veg very well.
not one strand was overcooked.
all al dente.
they could, however, be more generous with their confit eschallot though.

service staff here are obviously all seasoned ones and very well drilled.
japanese style efficiency in just in time precision.

more hits than misses and if you are willing to pay more for the view and romantic ambience then you will be a fan too.",4,restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vddTG3J-jzReDE8szSOYpw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/U0Pmzv6ORROlxe5rRDgkgQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KKdAwo5FzEjsrzbrIB0Jmg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kl8DsBeALf3stBZn20LJNw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nJUv0Fa80elht9iQVqkCKg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LXoV7cRipVy8laJ9GSRfhg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/goTSgo_JGWanwyj5PvNUMw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ACK3BL8ngv1pX03mETySOA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nVH6bEeFCItyl2_pSKTj4Q/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tRRqdsyhw_4OIWhvjsyKsA/o.jpg,"their reception counter on the 4th floor of ion orchard; table with view; romantic setting; restaurant week 3 course set dinner.; luke mangan everything; ala carte menu; raisin bread loaf with olive oil and dry herbs; luke is everywhere!; the literal lamp post at my table!; restaurant week set menu: 'glass' Sydney crab omelette, miso mustard broth",Food & Beverage
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,Hayley D.,24/8/2014,"I'm very particular about food and it's rare to find such a superb restaurant around these parts! We visited for their Sunday Brunch menu which at $40++ per head including juice and tea/coffee, is very much value for money. The menu only has a few options to choose from, and then you can pick two sides from the list to go with it. 

When our food arrived, it looked and tasted divine. I went for the eggs benedict with the smoked salmon gravlax, served with spinach on a couple of their own made crumpets. I chose the wagyu sausage and the pear and blue cheese salad for my sides. I would recommend everything that was on my plate, especially the wagyu sausage! 

The staff are very friendly and host a very relaxing atmosphere. 

We arrived slightly early and walked around ION Sky. I would highly recommend doing this as the views of Singapore and beyond are fab. If you are unfamiliar with your surroundings, there are signs showing what is where. 

The only downside, one which I found a little cheeky, is that if you wish to have a window table, then you must pay an additional $20 for the privilege. I had booked a table for 11am and although the restaurant was pretty much empty, we were sat in the centre of the room. The views are still fab though!

Salt Grill & Sky Bar,Cheryl N.,11/5/2014,"I like to dine with the world under my feet and if you do too, then scoot over to the newly refreshed Salt Grill &amp; Sky Bar at ION Orchard which provides a magnificent landscape of the Orchard Road skyline with their full glass floor-to-ceiling windows that span two storeys high. Swanky it is, Salt grill &amp; Sky Bar serves up some Modern Australian cuisine by celebrity chef-restaurateur Luke Mangan and is known for its one-of-a-kind experience that begins even before guests enter the restaurant. Special concierge reception, private lift, exclusive dining area... it's hard not to feel special here.

Modern Australian cuisine is an intersection of influences from cuisines around the world and i could taste that rightaway in the Amuse Bouche, Coconut broth with Sydney spice. Flavor-wise, it tasted very much like Thai Green Curry without the spice.

We then proceeded with our wine and dine event and our dishes were paired with drinks from the Award Winning New World Wine List of the Year 2013 by the World Gourmet Summit. There is also the signature range of eponymous 'Luke Mangan' wines which are produced in one of Australia's leading wine estates - TarraWarra Estate in Yarra Valley, which Chef Mangan was personally involved in the selection of the grapes and the blending of the wines.

Spring vegetables were served with the mild goats curd, ginger bread crumbs and dried black olives ($31). These are probably sous vide to seal in the freshness of spring.

I love my eggs and the 'Glass' Sydney crab omelette ($33) totally won me over with the precious sheets of runny egg in the center, enoki mushroom and herb salad in miso mustard broth. A generous serving of sweet crab meat was wrapped in the golden parcel. This is certainly a light dish that is refreshing with a basil taste (again, this is almost Thai food). 

Signature starters include the Tea smoked quail ($31), an original creation in which the bird is smoked with a combination of earl grey tea and rice, and nicely paired with almond cream, prunes, truffled grains (i believe there is quinoa), grilled shallot, sorrel. There are so many dimensions and flavors to this dish and i was slowly savoring each component. I haven't had prunes in a dish for sometime and it went well with the smokey tender quail.

For mains, we had the Sirloin Rangers Valley, New South Wales, 300 days grain fed Wagyu ($74). Moroccan spice, sauté spinach, eggplant puree, red wine sauce  Wasabi, whole grain mustard. Fantastic aubergine spiced purée. Pick your cut from the meat board before having it grilled to your preference (only medium rare for me).

Salt Grill & Sky Bar,Kenneth T.,27/5/2017,"Dining at @saltgrillandskybar #beautifulplace #wonderfulservice #greatfood starting with tasty chips on the house, followed by insightful knowledge while being served red wine . Restaurant uses #coravin to serve their wine, which helps preserves the wine within the bottle without opening it #genius even the bread  served was fragrant & went well with the olive oil & smashed nuts. Before serving the starters, the waitress, Eve, took out a crumber/crumb scoop/crumb picker... whatever you call it, & cleared the bread crumbs from the table with amazing efficiency! The starters continued to impress our taste buds as the shrimp sauce blended nicely with the scallop to deliver a fresh, yet full flavor. It was so good that we wiped it off our plates in the blink of an eye  mains came shortly after, & I must say that the pace at which the food was served wasn't too fast, & not too slow, which helped create a great transition between the dishes. Barramundi with prawn  tempura for me, & medium tenderloin for Serena. The full dish name was too long & I didn't note it down. The food quality's simply world-class, & I'd love to come back again for special occasions  & only for that, cuz the price was more to the steep end!",5,restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cW2P2JKX8oHOGsprKNPipw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_PvZTjCLQ5_7AnYEY1BqVg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qUxu0JHRa6keTCwyGNCobQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9JBJrm0lp2FrBDA5ECXXMQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/G-4SnAFUUI71NinHhDLlvQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/myzAKLWcXiw1fDnh28S0-w/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9Tb736jJphb3I2pPoomBaQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_TvKNGpwxoG8sg8Ygtpcjw/o.jpg,,Food & Beverage

The cocktail menu is pretty comprehensive. I had the 'perfect Manhattan' which was pretty well prepared. 

We had a few starters before the mains. While the portions were not large, they were delicious. There was nice spacing between courses.

The service was fairly relaxed, but could have used a little more attention for the prices. I would also expect a few more chef's tasters provided given the price tag.

Took part on contest by a travel company called Jetabout Holidays and got my salt grill dining voucher. Wouldn't really go for fine-dining if not for the fact that I was aware of it. Still valid I think until this week or something when I saw their link http://jetabout.com.sg/gourmet_contest.php

Ordered the pork belly dish and truffle oil french fries as a side dish. They're quite fresh and I especially enjoy the soft chewy & crispy texture of pork with sauce. Quite authentic though I haven't tried the coffee. So it was worth the wait.

Salt Grill & Sky Bar,Alaina F.,24/9/2015,"Overall: Had we stopped after the first course, this rating would be 5 stars.

The lift lobby and lift are pretty snazzy and in keeping with the 'sky' theme.  Entering the restaurant you are greeted with floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall views of the Singapore skyline. Beautiful space, elegant decore, romantic lighting make it a great choice for our first date night in Singapore. When booking I mentioned the occasion and requested window table which we were given though all tables have a skyline view.. 

We started with a bottle of Mum, the 'glass' crab omelette and the foie gras. 
The fluffy, delicate omelette was served in a broth that was packed full of flavour. Foie gras became one of my favourite dishes when I visited Budapest. I order it at nearly every opportunity.This version did not disappoint but the plate itself didn't really flow. The perfectly cooked scallop seemed a bit extraneous.

It basically went straight downhill from there. Our mains (snapper and kingfish) were fine but both over cooked. Dessert was ok, Coffees were outrageously overpriced. Service started off acceptable and dropped exponentially over the evening.",2,restaurants; restaurants,,,Food & Beverage
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,Nick N.,3/10/2015,"The location, view and decor was top class! The service and staff was quite good and the general atmosphere very pleasant. However, you walk through a shopping mall going in and again coming out which somehow lessens the experience (in my opinion) and leads me to wonder why the architects would not have considered having the lift run all the way to the ground floor instead. This is for sure not the fault of the restaurant. 

Nonetheless, the food, while being good, is somewhat overpriced. For 70+ sgd  for a steak there is an expectation that is not quite matched. Especially as the entrees are not served with much else, and each side dish at 10+ sgd, the costs run high quickly. Having said that the presentation is great as is the wine selection, the amuses bouches and the drinks.

I would absolutely recommend this place to have a drink, some appetizers and enjoy the view, but for a great steak, I would go elsewhere for value-money.",3,restaurants; restaurants,,,Food & Beverage

the food here strikes me as being classic but-not-really, very exquisite and rather well made - and very much in line with what I expect from a chinese restaurant inside a hotel: good service, food that's interesting but still familiar, and a peaceful ambience.

we did a fair bit of their smallish menu - and it was all pretty good. the food at my favourite paradise pavilion is a little more modern-interesting and might be tastier - but there's just something about sitting in a hotel-housed chinese restaurant that has all the pomp and luxuriance you just don't get in a stand-alone place.

The fried rice was abundant but not particularly flavorful. The vegetables were ok and we'll prepared. The tea was very nice. Service was good enough.

Firstly, the tea pairs extremely well with their dimsum, proving why the original name in chinese is ""morning tea"". Each dish has been delicately made and all the ingredients blends well without one overpowering the rest. Overall the taste is nothing short of exceptional. Fine food served on nicely decorated plate also adds to the visual experience in a very relaxed and comfortable armosphere. 

The ambiance and service is also amazing. The staff makes you feel like an honoured guest and they're very patient and knowledgeable with the menu.

Summer Pavilion,Derek S.,8/3/2023,"Came by for dinner the other night and it was a decent experience. Made a reservation with the Ritz-Carlton online and received an e-mail confirmation a couple of days prior to dining. 

Drop off from my driver was easy and uniformed bell hops were eager to assist. Summer Pavilion is tucked away in the back left of the hotel lobby and was unmarked from the lobby, a touch odd. The Ritz is definitely ""classic"" luxury. 

Clientele seemed touristy, including some loud tourists from mainland China speaking in their outdoor voices inside the restaurant... Staff wore a uniform, name tag, and a mask. Some staff even wore vinyl gloves.

Despite being a Michelin 1 star for Cantonese cuisine, the experience was more of a Westernized appraoch to Cantonese cuisine...

Ordered mainly from the Chef's Recommendation menu and started off with the scallop and eggplant. The Hokaido scallop was poached and seared perfectly. The shrimp paste inside the eggplant was on the blander side and now I understand why I was offered chili to complement this... 

Moved on to the seared Japanese wagyu beef with wild mushrooms and it was a slightly bizarre experience. Both the scallop and beef course were served with a side of knife and fork...I wasn't sure what was so Cantonese about this dish...might have been more Japanese/Western fusion?!?

The highlight of the meal was the fish noodle with Canadian lobster. The fish noodles were world class with a perfect al dente texture from what seemed to be fish paste. The Canadian lobster was decent, although I'm sure I've had fresher lobster in Canada...

Ended off the meal with the mango sago and it was a disappointment. The highlight were the fresh and flavorful mangos, same as I was able to find at the local grocery store. The actual sago was on the bland side...bummer.

Service throughout the meal was attentive, although not quite up to par with Michelin-rated standards. There was some overlap with the presentation of utensils for the next course before the current course was complete...felt like the courses were being rushed?!?

We got the har gow, siu mai, fried dumplings, glutinous pastry and goose liver fried rice.  

The fried rice was great but the rest were above average....but that's kind of like the minimum expected from a restaurant like this.

Summer Pavilion,Helena Q.,28/6/2019,"With a Michelin star under its belt, you'll find fancy upscale dim sum.  After sitting down (and having the staff put the napkins on our laps), my dad looked at us and asked, ""where's the paper to write down our order?"".  Like I said, upscale - so don't expect the usual bustle or self-service of a normal dim sum restaurant.

We ordered some of the usual dim sum dishes, har gao, soup dumplings etc.  The food was delicate, and expertly prepared.  Expensive yes, but this is really the kind of restaurant you'd go for a special occasion.

We also ordered a unique noodle dish - fried fish noodles, which was my favorite.  The noodles are actually made with fish (and presumably some starch to keep it together)!  Had great bounce to the texture, which was surprising.

Upscale dim sum isn't exactly my cup of tea, as I'd rather prefer the hustle and bustle of dim sum, but it was one of those experiences that you just have to try once!",4,restaurants; restaurants,,,Food & Beverage
CE LA VI,Carrie M.,22/2/2023,"The nighttime city views are breathtaking. Ce La Vi is at the top of Marina Bay Sands, right next to the infinity pool (you must be a hotel guest to access the pool). We made a reservation for ladies' night, which is Wednesday night in Singapore. The club lounge is more of a lounge and not a club as everyone was sitting around, and there was no dancing. There is also a restaurant, which requires a separate reservation.

The reservation is free to make, so you only pay for the drinks you order, which are very expensive but worth it for the views. The SkyPark costs $26 for admission, so it's a much better deal just to go to Ce La Vi to get the city views, which are a lot prettier at night. The cocktails are $25, and there is a special deal on ladies' night for $18 glasses of prosecco, white wine, and red wine.",5,nightlife; nightlife,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/aHrGqqW_6LSTtKcje-YykA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oIuDUhTY7TcxdoC32J_tfQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hxrYdShXovc34b7q4uQDXw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vPbhZmORvlcS6r5tDQUD-g/o.jpg,Infinity pool; Ladies' night; Singapore views; Prosecco and cocktail,Food & Beverage
CE LA VI,Roger P.,19/2/2023,"Located at the top of Marina Bay Sands, the Club Lounge offers amazing views over the city. But that's pretty much all you can expect. Instead of a fun vibe, the music and the service fell short and we left earlier than anticipated. Dress attire is dressy/casual smart! 

We didn't make any reservations and walked-in with no problem. At the first floor, there's a little counter where people line up and pay for cover. Each entry ticket comes with a drink and you would think that would be enough to make it worth it but more on that later. Elevators take you all the way to the top and the first thing you're greeted with is the dance floor. 

After walking around and taking pictures of the view, we redeemed our drinks. The service was unbelievably cold. Barely a word spoken and everybody just looked annoyed. The drinks were also so weak. I ordered a pineapple and vodka and it tasted like watered down pineapple juice. 

I think this place has a lot of potential. The space is nice, the views are amazing, but there was nothing else to keep us there. The music that day was too monotonous and no one enjoyed it. And on top of that, we couldn't hear each other over the noise so we ended up leaving within an hour to go gamble in the basement.",3,nightlife; nightlife,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/D3eJjrjpt40wVCssomjWvA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ouK6wZhzGKJgzNOdEcRsng/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tC8993BLaNSf6F-LPCsWAw/o.jpg,Views of the Infinity Pool; Cityscape; Cityscape,Food & Beverage

CE LA VI,Michelle N.,13/1/2023,"The main reason why we were interested in visiting the Ce La Vi Club Lounge was the view on top of the Marina Bay Sands, but also figured that the general vibe and included drink would add to our experience. Unfortunately that wasn't the case.

You pay cover of $38 and receive a drink coupon. Attire is dressy, men can't wear shorts. Once you pay, you go up in the elevator and there's an entry way where you can hear the music coming from. Dimly lit with loud music is the standard for any bar/lounge, and it isn't anything different here... except the music really was not enjoyable. Weird techno/house music that didn't really have a great beat, blasting loudly that you can barely hear your friends. Maybe the drinks would help things out?

Unfortunately they didn't - not sure if it's because they took our coupons and decided to skimp out for the freebie, but all our drinks tasted like they had no alcohol in it. The bartenders were not the least bit friendly either. 

The only saving grace is the view really - the high viewpoint of Singapore is truly breathtaking, but I only wish the rest of the experience was just as positive.",2,nightlife; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage
CE LA VI,Mingshi Y.,26/1/2023,"The view was great but the vibe was off. I think overall it is worth checking out, because you can see the whole city and some very notable sites.

The venue itself was underwhelming. You check in on the first floor, and they wouldn't let someone in our group up because they were wearing shorts (male). However, when we got up, after paying the $38pp cover, we saw many people dressed very casually. I mean, athletic clothes, running shorts for women, tennis shoes, suitcases and backpacks. The club is next to the hotel pool, where many people are swimming and lounging.

The DJ was playing the most generic music so no one was dancing. The bar was understaffed, and the ""free drink"" voucher that comes with the cover charge does not include cocktails.

There were open tables, and we asked one of the waitresses if we could sit without ordering, and she said yes.

Fantastic views of Singapore. This is an equally fantastic view you can enjoy from the MBS Infinity pool though. If you're a hotel guest, skip the bar by all means, and just enjoy the pool. This is the location of the Crazy Rich Asians ending scene too, which is kind of cool. 

Lousy drinks - they are the same price what you'd pay at a good cocktail bar (there are SO many world's top 50 cocktail bars in Singapore!!!), except they taste like shampoo. Super gross. They were somewhat drinkable though, and I did drink them to prevent waste. They also couldn't make the ""Sunset Sling"" drink I wanted for some reason. 

Service was irritating - unattentive, even though the place was empty.

Instead paid for Skypark to access the tower, might as well paid for the drink at the CE LA VI Club. The proper way to get to the club is use the elevator at tower 3. Which northern tower. The elevator will make the ear pop due to high speed elevator.

We paid $35 per person just to enter this so-called ""club lounge,"" and that credit could be used toward food--but what's the point if they refuse to serve you? We waited a good 30 minutes, and not a single server came to us. I had to start flagging them down, and even then, two servers brushed me off, saying they'd come back but never did. When I finally got a third server's attention, I was told they don't serve food in the area we were sitting in. That was a lie.

Less than a foot away, a white couple was getting full service, with a server coming up to them to ask if they wanted to order more food. At the same time, another server was bringing food to the white couple sitting behind us. It was so bad that the white couple next to us even offered to order food for us because they saw what was happening.

And here's the kicker: the servers who ignored us were Asian themselves. They deliberately chose to serve white and Japanese guests while refusing to serve us. This wasn't bad service--this was outright discrimination.

If you're not white or Japanese, don't waste your time or money here. They will take your entrance fee but won't treat you like a valued customer. Absolutely disgusting behavior.",1,nightlife; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage

Esssentially, it just means you need to buy a drink.

Once upstairs and you go inside, it's got a lounge feel. All the tables had a reserved sign and there wasn't much direction where to go. Eventually, we asked an employee and they told us we could sit at a table, but had to leave once the reserved party came. As we sat there, no one came to help us either. When we went to the bar to order drinks, they told us someone should've helped us. I'm not sure what was going on, but we finally ordered our Singapore Slings (SG$25).

CE LA VI,Neelu Y.,27/6/2018,"I'm honestly pretty disappointed with my visit here. We were hoping to head to the restaurant and enjoy a meal, but unfortunately it was all booked so we opted for the lounge instead. There was a $20 entrance fee but those funds can be applied as a voucher for food and drinks, so that's much nicer than paying $20 just to visit the skypark. The voucher only lets you in to the lounge and restaurant areas, so you can't actually go to the skypark but you still get the incredible view. The view is amazing. You can see so much of Singapore from the 57th floor. I just wish that the experience at the lounge could have been better. They let way too many people up considering that they had half of the seating blocked off and covered. The result? Nearly everyone was stuck standing and it was extremely crowded. It was very difficult to walk. 

The food was mediocre. Definitely not worth the money. The chicken satay reminded me more of kabob that anything else, and the korean chicken wings honestly did not taste good at all. They had a strange flavor and they were very spicy. The squid was okay, definitely not the worst calamari I've ever had. 

The service is slow as waiters are hard to find. If you come here, I recommend grabbing a drink instead of a bite to eat.",3,nightlife; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage

It was hard to get a good view of the city with the sky observation deck open but thankfully they closed the deck for a private event so we were able to get a really nice view after all.

If you're coming for the city view, be prepared to be disappointed. The best view is at the observatory, one floor below. You can see everyone enjoying the view from the observatory level. 

Imagine the lounge as the balcony of the observatory. You get a glimpse of the view, but you're not close enough to see it well. You also have to fight for a standing table.

Not sure there was a cover charge or not but they stamped something on my arm at the door. 

Service was great, friendly and fast, they let us sit at the reserved table so we can comfortably sit.

They had members only area in the back near the famous pool, I asked but after too few many drinks I can't remember what they said.

Bathroom is located one floor down, clean but I was super careful walking down the stairs.

I am not really a night club type person, in fact last time I stepped inside a night club was just about four years ago in Jakarta Indonesia, so I really don't have anything to compare to if this was good or not but with this view, it's so worth going up here at least once.

It was night time and we got up to the ticket counter at exactly 9:00pm, expecting there to be a cover. Oddly, we were told that there was no cover after 9:00pm to go up to the 57th floor. Before 9pm, it was $20, which could be applied toward drink purchases.

Once we got up, we walked around the bar area, which is connected to the restaurant. The view is not bad but you can't get to the edge of the building as that section is blocked off as an extension of the SkyPark.

We walked around to the other side of the floor and found the club lounge. It was more lively with a DJ playing (repetitive) Latin music. The four of us found a small table and ordered drinks, which cost ~$22 each on average. The club lounge was adjacent to the Infinity Pool, which is worth a look. This is the closest you'll be able to get to it unless you are a hotel guest.

It's kind of breezy, so you don't have to worry about it being too hot, since it's not an indoor and air-conditioned club.

There's basically just standing area along the perimeter of the club. All the sofa and tables are for reservation only, as per usual club norms. The music seemed to be catered towards a more matured crowd and I grew bored of it instantly.

I recommend hitting the bar up on a weekday or Sunday around 5 or 6 so you can actually get a table next to the railing. Don't forget, there are 2 sides to this bar (a lounge side and a bar side), so don't get stressed if the lounge side is full.

But one thing to know $22 sg would only buy a glass of whiskey, rum, vodka.... no cocktails are covered. I had to pay extra $6 sg on top of the voucher to buy a mojito, which was really needed in the hot humid weather of Singapore. The drink was balanced not too strong or watered down, couldn't really taste the mint much. But yeah was a disappointment in quality coming from a five star place...after that I opted to not waste anymore money on any drink. It's important to know Singapore levies more taxes on alcohol so it's going to be pricier. Overall definitely a tourist attraction the rooftop is nice and all but does not have amazing view as the hotel itself is a thing to look at. Except the water show which is a nice addition.

I say this because Ku Te Da is one floor higher than the SkyPark, offers the same view, and if you come before they start charging cover (which is after 9 PM on Fridays and the weekend) then you can basically get the view for free (or at least have an alcoholic beverage to go with it.) If you come later on the weekend and do pay the $38 cover, it should come with a drink. 

I've been here twice, as a tourist and to bring other tourists, and it's been okay. Both times I was there before midnight, so the DJ was playing hits from 2007 (Timbaland/Nelly Furtado's ""Give it to me"" is a good example) and no one was utilizing the small dance floor. If you're patient, you can snag a spot by the cocktail tables along the perimeter and take a few good pictures.

Because of the outdated music, cover charge, and older/tourist crowd, I file this place under ""Singapore Tour Guide destination / Good to say you've been once"".

Now for the alcohol. To be honest, I have no idea how much bottles are here because my friend foot the tab but I do know that the shots here range above S$30+ (about $22 USD). Bit pricy for US standards but I've heard that it's to be expected in Singapore. 

Final verdict? Visit if you're in the country. I think it's a great place for tourists (like me) to get their Instagram-worthy pictures so don't miss out on the opportunity! Do it for the gram.",4,nightlife; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage

Though it provides a great view of the city, you might as well just pay to go to the observation deck of the hotel because the bar is usually crowded and you can't find a seat with a good view.

CE LA VI,Jason H.,13/2/2014,"Pretty sweet view from up here. I just ate at the restaurant so I did not eat here. The alcohol and beer is waaaay expensive. $22 for pint. Yikes!

You're basically paying a premium for the view. I'd do this again. Have a beer for $22 and lookout over Singapore. You can buy a ticket for the observation deck and save $2 but definitely cool to sit up here and have a beer with this view. I was right next to the pool and that is so cool. It is for registered guests only but it made me want to be a registered guest. I'm giving it 3 for the view alone.

CE LA VI,Leena T.,23/11/2016,"Pros:
- great tasting drinks with good selection to choose from
- excellent view

Cons
- crap service
- must sell a kidney for a drink
- no one on the dance floor

No but really, I came on a Friday early into the night, paid $30 pp cover charge per person, although it was more of a voucher where you could use that ticket value towards a drink.
Drinks are 35+ so you still have to shell out some extra cash based on what you order. Ridiculous greater than NY prices, but the view is spectacular and the experience is even better with good company. 

They do have a closed off lounge area, ie $2-3000 for bottle service and your very own table!

Honestly, glad I ventured here but not sure this a place to go after one visit unless to bring a visitor.",3,nightlife; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage
CE LA VI,Elizabeth N.,4/9/2014,"Wednesdays are Ladies nights! Girls get in for free and receive a complimentary drink. The view alone is worth a trek out to this venue. I went to the bar side first where they give you a free drink and then went to the club area and they gave you another voucher. 

The club side is more of a party with a vegas feel but on a rooftop. I honestly don't think that anything can beat the view. I have been to HK and aqua bar and those bars are amazing but this is higher and outside.",4,nightlife; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage
CE LA VI,David T.,1/5/2014,"This place is for (package) tourists.. it's only redeeming quality is the view. But then again, you can get an equally amazing view from other bars/restaurants such as 1 Altitude or the lovely Lantern poolside.

You are treated like (stray) animals from the moment you arrive.  You have to queue up to get in the elevator and get in line when you are at at the front desk upstairs, just like a herd of cattle.  Then you are hand-picked by the rude hostesses to enter, a bit like how someone hand picks meat at a supermarket.  And when you are inside you are subjected to treatment as if you are a diseased dog... needless to say drinks prices are a total rip-off!

Awful service + bad attitude + horrendous prices makes this one of the worst places in a beautiful city! Worst still the management are disrespectful & are renown for mistreating their clients....

CE LA VI,Laura L.,14/2/2013,"I've visited KDT several times - and it's because of the spectacular vantage point.

Here, it's all about the views you get perched atop the Marina Bay Sands, feeling slightly glorious with the wind in your hair as you survey the Singapore CBD skyline.  The MBS is a little set aside from the the rest of the CBD, which means that it's an excellent spot to scope out both the older Raffles Place CBD and the Marina Bay Financial Centre.  It's a different perspective compared to some other rooftop bars which are nestled in the CBD, and thus don't offer that panoramic view.

Besides the views, the other factors here are adequate-to-good.  Decent cocktail and drinks list.  Bar snacks are limited.  Crowded.  Unless there's a special event on, music is not spectacular.  Staff try to help, but seem perpetually a bit overwhelmed by the crowds.  On the pricey side, over S$20 for a cocktail.

In summary: If KDT was located on the ground floor like any other bar, I wouldn't bother.  But the awesome views make is worth checking out.",4,nightlife; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage
CE LA VI,Jane Y.,6/4/2018,"TERRIBLE. Service greatfood and drinks way overpriced. Had 3 experiences -- first with husband was great. Second

Third and last time just terrible 3 different men got in my face to pay the bill, before I got my drink. Very rude, disrespectful, upsetting. Then they refused to charge bill to my room because it was in husbands name.  They acted like I wasn't going to pay the bill!

Drinks I think are pretty standard, tourists will definitely think it's pricey, but that's just the culture. Definitely a place you have to get a table to fully enjoy, cheapest one I found was 600 for 2 bottles, which isn't too bad, but only gets you a small circular table for 2-4. There's no room really for people that don't get bottles. The dance floor is kind of on the small side but can show your moves. They have a separate area for VIP which has a premium of 1500, not too sure how many people that gets you in though. Dress code is standard club attire, non casual. Definitely a place tourists should check out. If you're a guest at this hotel, they have an infinity pool that's a def must see. Good for pictures haga",4,nightlife; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage
CE LA VI,Hoa M.,2/1/2013,"You are paying for the view.  Just keep that in mind as you are sipping the equivalent of $18 US dollars for a drink.

Spectacular views.  It really is worth the expensive drink.",4,nightlife; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage
CE LA VI,Jennie L.,8/7/2013,"Follow the signs to 'SkyBar' and it will lead you to one end of the first floor of the Marina Bay Sands. Be aware that they will not let you in if you are wearing flip-flops, and guys must wear long pants (no shorts). Besides that, the dress code isn't too strict. Ku De Ta is a perfect place to go afterwork with some coworkers to enjoy a spectacular view of the Singapore skyline and taste some delicious cocktails. 

However, each cocktail will cost about S$25 (just less than $20 USD) after the Service Charge (10%) and GST (7%). But, as the others said... you are paying for the view. It will take a while for you to get your drink though, it took about 15 minutes to get the bartender's attention and about 15 minutes more just to get our change/credit cards back. But, these are pretty high quality drinks that you can not get at a hectic club. A lot of the options were fruity and sweet, my favorite! We had a few drinks here, it took a while but it was worth the view. We just stood by the railings and looked over the beautiful city (the Haze was just starting to clear up, yay!) and sipped on our beautifully crafted cocktails. 

I personally wouldn't stay here for the night, it is just a good place to get an amazing view and start off your night. 

We then headed to the Ku De Ta Club a few meters away - but that club is a bit small, but there is an outside balcony where you can enjoy half of the view as well and see the Infinity Pool from there! 

This is somewhere you HAVE TO go at least ONCE, which I did... and probably would only go max one more time. The service time is just too excruciatingly long and not worth the price.",3,nightlife; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage

Prices? Expensive, for everything, so i suggest pre-gaming. I'm not exactly cheap, but when your so accustomed to American prices for alcohol (and I lived in nyc which isn't exactly THAT cheap), its hard not to feel your heart cringe at sipping something that would normally not cost more than $8 back home. 

The music is actually pretty nice. Thumping minimal beats, clubby lounge music. I like!

The staff feels like family (Francesca, Joanne and Sourav) and the venue is pretty much home.

ATLAS,Desh M.,4/1/2024,"This is on the World's Top 50 bar list for a reason. Talk about swanky and cool! We were in Singapore and didn't have a reservation- since we were in the haji lane area, we decided to pop in to see if we could get a seat. Luckily, we showed up in the afternoon, so it was a bit slower, and they were able to get us seats at the bar after about a 45min wait. Dress code only applies after 5pm as well, which we were happy about since we had been walking around Singapore in more casual attire the whole day.

As the bar with the most number of gins in the world, it's clear what kind of spirit you're going to be drinking mostly. Though, they do have others as well - I actually got their old fashioned, though with a look of disappointment from the bartender. Old fashioned was fantastic. My wife got the gin and tonica, which was incredible! The bartenders were very knowledgeable- making custom drinks based on flavor profiles I requested. For example, they used a lemongrass-infused gin for one of my cocktails, which was great!

Upon walking in, they were able to accommodate us at the bar (which is my preference anyway) and the entire restaurant is beautiful inside. There are no bad spots. 

The bartenders were all very knowledgeable, had great recommendations backed up by quality drinks, and I loved the food. He recommended truffle fries which I've had a million times which I like fries, love truffles, but it's typically a little truffle oil on some fries with Parmesan how I've experienced and leaves a lot to be desired. The fries came out covered in freshly grated truffle and were unbelievable. I'm not sure I've ever had fries and left wanting more until this experience. I had the escargot as well which I also really enjoyed and the flavor was different from what I'm used to. 

For drinks, I started with the martini flight. I'm a huge espresso martini girl (sorry bartenders) and this one did not disappoint. I also loved the citrus twist martini and the other one was good but mostly not my flavor profile. My friend had the French 75 which I love but typically ask to hold the syrup.

ATLAS,Michael B.,21/9/2024,"This is likely the prettiest bar you'll ever visit and they make excellent drinks, but that doesn't make up for a few details that need correcting.

Order any drink with the name Atlas in it for a wonderful cocktail. We tried them all and loved each. However, the Atlas orange G&T came with the tonic water separate. If I wanted to pour my own drink I'd make one at home. The bill showed that still water isn't free making this the only bar of this caliber that didn't provide free tap water. The bartender didn't interact with us outside serving the drinks. That's totally okay on its own, they could have had a rough day. However, at other Top 50 bars in the area the bartenders happily interacted with us or even struck up conversation on their own. It's was a disappointing experience when you compare them to other bar counter experiences.

Overall I don't think $28 SGD per drink is warranted (as of September 2024) at Atlas. It's a good bar, but probably not a 50 Best Bar at the moment.",4,nightlife; nightlife,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hZG1gCVDZ92RUb1VdWb3dw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/aJ0GYK4jABFf8jpaY62zSA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FAM3R7b70CPra1BpN9xsCw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VxQKB7MXXQtNFsMsDjb4Fw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VFFjI6TdJsSHWoCg2MBUtQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OFmzwsUj4jd99SAFCba-6g/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UD6T2iAL3lGExVg-ldhP7A/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0pmOxSr5fU725G9md2gE-Q/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/s5Ex5iJvYeGjekwcPJa0kg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/92fsR-WiePe9bmdCuBLQ-g/o.jpg,,Food & Beverage
ATLAS,Jodi H.,21/6/2024,"World's 50 Best Bars. Ranked no. 27 when we visited in 2023. Not Asia, but WORLD, mind you. ATLAS, after Ayn Rand's masterful book Atlas Shrugged (shrieks). Check out the decor details for tie ins, as well as art structures within and outside in the courtyard. The architecture, my friends! No doubt the ambiance heavily relies on it. Glamorous gothic art deco. Jaw dropping ceilings. And the monument we've been waiting for: THE GIN TOWER. 15 meters of over a thousand gin brands! Shrieking again.

Dress code fiercely, maybe even snobbishly enforced. They will look you up and all the way down to your shoes. Might not be the only reason you don't get in. Reservations advised, though we did not have any. We got in by the skin of our teeth. There was room at the bar for merely an hour. If you only get one shot, take it!

We all ordered different gin martinis I had one barreled in Au and had strawberry jam and Basil notes. Although the drinks were amazing at $28 plus a drink I was expecting better service and it did feel short.

ATLAS,Jocelyn L.,17/2/2022,"I've been wanting to come to Atlas since the first time I came to Singapore back in 2018. It's currently sitting at World's Top 50 Bars at #16. Just google the pictures - it's quite an amazing setting. It's a HUGE bar, with furniture and 1920s setting in what feels like the prohibition Great Gatsby era, Art Deco.  It's done incredibly well. 

But back to the drinks....they are famous for their Gin and Martinis. They have a very wide selection of different types of gins, including rare ones that date back to the 1920s!!! and every decade from 1920s until now!!! Quite impressive, especially if you are into Gin.
 
My husband and I got a few rounds here before dinner elsewhere. I ended up getting the Atlas Orange Gin and Tonic, which was fantastic. It's their own made orange gin, and it tastes like oranges. It was delicious, and I wish I had tried a little bit more of the gin itself before mixing all the tonic inside. 

My husband got the Atlas Suite of Martinis, which included 3 mini martinis each of the Atlas martini, orange blossom martini, and the espresso martini. Those were pretty good too, our favorite being the espresso martini. 

2nd round - I got the Atlas French 75 (London dry gin, lemon, peach, salt, champagne), with a candied kumquat on top. Delicious... My husband ordered the Barrel-Rested Gin and Tonic (Australian barrel-rested gin, yuzu tonic, ginger) - loved this one. You could really taste the yuzu flavor, and it went very well with the gin. So delicious!!!

I also saw on their website that they have this bottomless pouring menu on Sundays....wow. Over the top. Wish I could experience that sometime in my lifetime. I'm glad to have come here once, perhaps someday when I return to Singapore in the future.

The architecture was absolutely gorgeous and the staff is also very friendly and professional. The interior screams Great Gatsby vibes. 

Wished we could have planned it a bit better in advance, but even months before our trip there were no reservations available on their website. When we went we could have waited for 1.30 hrs for a table but decided to just have drinks at the bar instead, which was first come first serve. 

Drinks were of course pricey but also very unique. I recall their drinks menu had inspiration from different cities around the world --hence the name Atlas. Some drinks had an accompaniment of chocolate as a palette enhancer. 

I must also say the complementary beet chips were addicting.

From curious-looking statues and gargoyles to truly intricate gilded gold Art Deco architecture, the ambience in this place is STUNNING. You will absolutely need to make reservations for afternoon tea in advance because they tend to be booked out a month in advance. There is a dress code (for example, men need to wear long pants and covered shoes) so be mindful of that. Service was great - the hostess immediately noticed I was pregnant and ensured that all items in my tea platter were fully cooked and offered a non-alcoholic drink menu (highly recommend the Crown Utama one with grape verjus by the way - so refreshing!). I did however wish that she would have informed me that they'd be replacing my smoked salmon and iberico jambon bites with just avocado and red peppers so that I could have chosen to keep those and give them to my dining companion instead (since iberico ham is way more expensive than red peppers!). The $56++/pax afternoon tea menu includes 2 drinks (namely a small welcome cocktail/mocktail and a pot of tea)- everything else will cost you extra. The food itself was good, with the best item probably being the mushroom with mashed potato purée and banana cream pie tart. The music playlist at the venue was stellar.

There are quite a few interesting drinks and spirits on the menu -- and you will pay for them! The food menu is a bit limited, but everything that we had was quite good. They serve their gin drinks in large goblets with lots of ice, and they match the tonic with the botanicals in the gin you select, which I think is the proper way to do it.

This gloriously opulent art-deco styled bar, luxuriously appointed with vaulted mural ceilings, is located in the ground floor of a Gotham City inspired skyscraper. 

Named after the Greek titans of endurance bearing the mirror-sheened Atlas stone in front of the entrance - you'll be pleasantly surprised as you enter and take in the optics of this stunningly designed wonder. The best seating is at the bar where you can banter with the bartenders and be baffled by their bottlework (or just stare at the bottles; whatever takes your fancy).

I've had negroni, old fashioned, and gin + tonic here and they are all exceptional executions of classic cocktails.

Warning 1: There's a $250 Gin + Tonic on the menu, be careful you don't order that unless you really mean to order that!

Warning 2: The beetroot chips are seriously addictive and whenever you get low they'll refill these and you may lose track of just how many you have. You've been warned!

Warning 3: The cocktails are well-balanced, but boozy, meaning you won't be able to tell they have a whack in them. When you stand up, you may find yourself wobblier than a busted bike wheel, so please do attempt to retain your dignity by walking slowly towards the exit.

ATLAS,Doreen T.,20/2/2018,"The place was within walking distance from the MRT station. Although it was weekday, the place enjoyed a healthy flow of customers. For the 3 of us, we were showed to a table with a sofa and 2 armchairs. After looking through the menu, we decided on the 3 course lunch set(S$48++). Still and sparkling water was chargeable at S$2++ per person.

For the starters :
'cavolo monachina' green cabbage, pine nuts, raisin, anchovies (S$20++)
Savoury cabbage which reminded one of chinese style braised vegetable filling for spring roll, with the nuts giving it texture. 

'frittata di pasta' spaghetti and eggs, broccoli rabe, sausage (S$22++)
It was like a pancake made of spaghetti and eggs, topped with broccoli and slices of sausage. Slightly dry but flavourful.

'uova in purgatorio' tomato soup and runny egg yolk... in the shell (S$18++) 
The dish was served in egg shells which were held upright by salt, accompanied with buttery soft toast soldiers. Underneath the foam, was the tomato soup, packed with mouthfuls of vegetables, plus the egg yolk right below. It kind of balance the sour taste of the tomato soup.

For mains : 
'baccala' salted cod, gaeta olives , capsicum neapolitan style (S$29++)
Light battered fish, which tasted slightly salty but firm and meaty. 

braised lamb, green peas, zucchini, fresh mint 'alla scapece' (S$30++)
The lamb was quite tender and sliced easily. None of the gamey taste but it was bit too heavily flavoured. 

maine lobster roll, artisanal brioche bun, marie rose dressing (S$30++)
Topup S$4++ for set 
The bun looked kind of hard but it was lightly crispy and buttery. Stuffed with finely chopped pickled vegetables and juicy lobster meat, it was quite appetizing. 

Lastly the desserts : 
'baba' infused with frangelico liqueur, whipped mascarpone cream (S$14++)
The baba were cute little buns which were soft and moist. Could not get enough of them.

fried 'struffoli' dough, honey and cinnamon parfait (S$14++) 
Light crispy puffs paired with ice cream.

ATLAS signature madeleines, jam and chantilly cream (S$14++) 
It looked simple, but I was blown off by the lemony moist texture.",4,nightlife; nightlife,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/guoGTpa-GJdzMUhyJEwRLg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AyXwu1_C__bNNXhjULrHqQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/S7EEiamFtm8I00mZFfo-Sg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Xk7b4BaT62aMlMLQzJ5RjQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/p1du-2gCDXcBvc77ccfzRw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DOC0ZcZmjicTJSINxV3IyA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/T5K8VGS-UVhDkO2BrGJMJQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/aN2P3icMcXh9MJdxEhynyw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/b8pMh4gqs22AgWVWk6doGA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6xBfz3mBaYXqgZU6dSzQbA/o.jpg,,Food & Beverage

I came here for dinner. The drinks and food here are really pricey but that is expected coming to a venue like this. I ordered the cod and the truffle pasta special. The food was good    and not amazing. The portion size is on the small side so you will need to order more than a main to feel full.

As always what others say, the Great Gatsby feel here is strong.

They have some complimentary great popcorn, but where else can you get some delish madeleines at 12 midnight?

Drinks here are good and quite strong, but for the price you expect them to be. The one thing this place lacks is a personal touch, even seated at the bar. Due to the size of this place, that's probably why.

ATLAS is an experience.  The interior itself is one of the most beautiful interiors I've ever seen, in a bar or otherwise, and it's easily worth whatever price of admission.  The service is phenomenal, the food is phenomenal, the drinks are phenomenal.  Everything oozes class and character in a manner which simply cannot be undersold - it's breathtaking.

Of course, with this experience comes a caveat: cost.  This place isn't cheap, and the argument could be made that the drinks and food aren't as good as the price commands.  With that said, I'm inclined to say that the entire package is worth the high price - even if the drinks weren't the best I've ever had by any stretch, the overall atmosphere and experience made them feel like it.",5,nightlife; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage

ATLAS,Courtney L.,6/3/2018,"Wow! The interior of this building and the bar are absolutely stunning. This was the first stop on our bar craw of all the locations in Singapore that made the World's Best Bars list. The menu has hundreds and hundreds of options, but most of them are gin. You can order your gin based on the decade it was made, from the country of origin, or by taste. I loved flipping through the menu before settling on the most basic of basic: The ATLAS Gin & Tonic.. :) Definitely the best G&T I've had in my life, but then again I've only had a handful worthy of mentioning in the first place. However, ATLAS was hands down the most stunning interior I've ever seen. My husband and I just sat on the couch with our heads swiveling back and forth taking in the decor. In the center of the bar is a giant elevator-like shaft with level upon level of bottles.. and a little dolly for the employees to harness themselves in and wheel up and down. I was super disappointed nobody used it while we were there! This is absolutely worth a stop while you are in Singapore (and right next door to the Andaz hotel), but remember to look sharp. There is a dress-code. We got our drinks around noon and we got to cuddle up on a couch and listen to the music. Definitely made us feel like we are far fancier than reality :)

ATLAS,Grant L.,1/4/2020,"I knew from the photos that it was a beautiful bar, but I am pleased to announce that the drinks are of equal quality. The Transatlantic really stood out as one of the most memorable drinks I had in Singapore. Between the fresh apple juice and wasabi oil, it was just unlike any drink I've ever had before. Interesting flavors and perfectly balanced. The staff was really friendly, and by the way they talked to some of the other guests at the bar I get the sense they have their share of regulars. A very memorable experience in the haze of my Singapore bar crawl.",5,nightlife; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage
ATLAS,Shawn B.,2/8/2017,"It's been a few months since they were able to work out their opening kinks and I found this bar to be absolutely stunning in every way. The impression you get when you walk in is breathtaking where you feel you walk into a totally different era. Reminds me of a different version of Eleven Madison Park in NYC - the classic Art Deco New York City feel.

Drinks are wonderful - I had one that had some cardamom and gin and it was fantastic. They have a huge Gin tower with the largest selection of Gin I've ever seen and some interesting vintage Gin that didn't taste much different to me (I tried the 80s gin). Great bartenders and friendly hostesses. I've been here 3 times and found service to be fine at peak and normal hours so maybe they got it down.

Definitely a hot spot that I would highly recommend (and make reservations for). Only downside is that since that area is still full of surrounding construction, it isn't too easy to call a cab or pin point the Uber location since the 600 North Bridge Address is the entire building's address with a drop off point in front of the building (Atlas is in the back). 

Make sure you are in dress code if you are there after 5 pm! Before 5 PM they are OK with t-shirts, shorts and slippers. Afterwards, they are not cool with it.",5,nightlife; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage
ATLAS,Sue T.,26/10/2018,"One of my favorite bars so far. 
Very nice cocktails, decent and good variety wine list and a very cozy and has a very classic + well put together environment. I would say it is a intimate and cozy place. 

I was there In the afternoon and had no problem finding a seat. However, I heard this place gets very crowded at night time (vibe is different as well) and hard to make a reservation. If you are in Singapore  only for a few days, would recommend to go in the afternoon.",5,nightlife; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage
ATLAS,David M.,8/2/2018,"Update: I finally found myself wearing acceptable attire to be allowed admission into the bar. Staff were super preoccupied, but when I caught their attention they were friendly. Drinks are interesting and well made, and the atmosphere inarguably transports you to Gatsby. The staff offered me a petting aperitif before I left, as they were entertaining a large group at the bar. It was a nice gesture given their preoccupation with the large, clearly more jovial patrons. IF you find yourself in ArtDecoWear and there's a spot readily available, I'd say it's worth a stop. 

If you like pretentious bars with mediocre drinks in a fantastic Art Deco setting, this is your place. If you love great drinks and good company, there are too many other places in Singapore... don't waste your time here.",3,nightlife; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage
ATLAS,Catharina I.,9/3/2017,"The renewed Atlas bar is like a Tinder date: the idea sounds great: you go for the looks and the first impression is amazing but ultimately it is a disappointment.

This bar looks fantastic, the building and interior is really impressive (think art-deco Great Gatsby style), I was truly wow-ed by the atmosphere at first sight but as the night progressed, the swinging music changed into a random mix of depressing tracks. 

The menu has quite some cocktails, some will set you back $200++ but since I still wanted to eat the remainder of the week, my friend and I went for the Atlas signature martini. Not bad, plus the glass was very pretty however I prefer a regular dirty martini. For my second drink I had a glass of Pinot Noir which was not bad either but I would have preferred to see more classic cocktails on the menu, as I am a classics girl and I also feel it would go well with the theme.

As for the service.... I cannot say anything more than that it is a plain disappointment. We had to wave down the waitress several times, our water was never topped up (and they charge $2++ for ""free"" flow water) and none of the staff made us feel really welcome. If I pay almost 75$ a person for two drinks and a cheese plate I do expect good service!

ATLAS,Peter L.,30/12/2017,"Atlas is a swanky newish bar near Bugis, which is quite dramatic in a number of ways.  As you enter the art deco space, you feel like you are in NYC and not in Singapore, and the space is amazing. There are liquor bottles stacked on shelves that can be accessed only by ladders.  There is a champagne room as well where they store their extensive selection.  Menu-wise, the focus here is on gin and champagne, although they have a decent selection of whiskey and other booze as well.  And personally, it's the only place in town with a decent selection of genever - most bars would be lucky to have a single bottle, but here there are probably over 50 different bottles!  The total tally for gin is over 1,000 different bottles from around the globe.  The bartenders are quite good, with a few I recognized from other great Singapore bars such as Anti:dote.  It is a bit more formal here, and even for an open bar seat, you do need to check in with the host.   I've always gone early though so getting a seat hasn't been a problem, although I can imagine this place getting packed later in the evening.

THIS IS THE COOLEST PLACE EVER.

I've actually added it to the top of everyones lists of places to go when visiting Singapore. This is where I want to have every first date because its just such an awesome concept. You literally can request your hearts desire of a cocktail and have it made for you right in front of your eyes. Its such a wonderful experience because it allows you to get creative and feel like you've somehow involved yourself in the creation that the extremely talented individuals here have mustered up for you by calling out a theme.

The only downside would be that the drinks take a while to make, but you can watch them do it in awe, and to be honest, its an excuse for me to drink slower, hah! Also you can see the love and time they put into making the masterpiece which is your drink and watch everyone else's faces light up in receiving their own godly creation.

The staff there are so friendly, daring you on to do your worst as if they're just bursting to come up with something new. And when they did make the cocktails, most of the time it was something completely innovative that they had just come up with on the spot. Very impressive!

The flavours we had last time were.. Something Chocolatey (served in an actually Nutella jar!), Something with Pineapple, Strawberry and White Chocolate (my favourite flavours and actually the best cocktail of my life), Fruity with fire (and fire there was), Lychee Champagne, and Peanut Butter (which turned into Peanut butter with a shot of jelly grape liquor which was DELICIOUS - also a mahoosive pink pocky stick was added to the mix - presentation is on point here!).

The following time I had come, I was the first to arrive and I got to come around the bar and shake a drink (so sorry to the poor guy at the receiving end of that one) which was sweet. That time I got given this chocolate concoction surrounded by chocolate sauce, ice cream and chocolate biscuits. Have a look at the photo - CRAZY!

Next time I'll be back with better flavours.. I've got something with Cheesecake up my sleeve..",5,nightlife,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/R2gDd8N2dEykALylowmm0Q/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gihkrpgkMOn-lxl4MaVkWA/o.jpg,"Peanut butter and jelly, lychee and champagne and something fruity",Food & Beverage

Bar Stories,Jerilyn M.,18/7/2013,"Let me start by saying, if a guy brought me here on a first date, I'd be more than impressed. 

Hidden amongst Hookah bars and cool hipster shops on Haji Lane lies this little gem... A cocktail-only bar, Bar Stories doesn't come with a menu, nope! Just creative mixologists, who take a few moments to talk to you about 'your perfect cocktail' and then whip it up for you.

For my first drink, I asked for something subtly sweet/sour, but not overly sweet. I ended up getting a concoction that involved berries and a mini ice sculpture. For my second, I wanted something chocolate-y and pretty. Yet, strong. I ended up getting the most delicious alcoholic dessert in a cup, exactly what I was looking for. It involved nutella, dark rum and a bunch of other things accompanied by a green tea chocolate wafer biscuit and a nutella spread cracker on the side. It hit the spot. 

Granted, service is a little slow... but only because they take a lot of time to make each drink super special. My advice, come with a girlfriend and sit at the bar. And then enjoy a few cocktails (at $25 per drink) over a night of catching up or getting to know someone.

4 stars instead of 5 only because I wish they served alcohol on the rocks on the side too. I know it's a cocktail-only concept but it makes it kind of hard if you're in a group and one or two people don't drink cocktails/mixed drinks at all (like most guys don't). Otherwise, love this bar.

Bar Stories,Kanchan B.,3/1/2016,"Love, love, love the concept! But word on the street and actual reality is a wee bit different. So the tour guide who told us about this bar said the concept was based around telling the bartender your life story and he would make a cocktail for you, based on your life story. Reality is that he comes and consults with you on the flavours and tastes you like (sweet, sour, spicy, etc) and then suggests a cocktail based on your answers.  You can veto his suggestions, if as an example you don't like the fact that gin is involved, but hey, would you tell Michelangelo how to paint?

All of 6 of us just had a great evening and there were some great surprises when the drinks finally came out (we all tasted each others). My fave was this amazing cardamom gin that tasted incredible, as will as this non-alcoholic cranberry drink that had a chili kick at the end. Prices were totally dependent on the alcohol involved - the cocktails ranged from S$20-35 and the mocktails were from S$10-15.

Appetizers were different - Shimeiji Fries which we thought were tasty but wished for the Cilantro Calamansi mayo to have more cilantro and calamansi...but still delightful. 

The Seabass Pate was pleasant.

Curried Mussels - a big hit! We note that their sauces and blended gravies are super tasty - wish we had more mantou to schlepp it up with!

Charred Golden Pomfret - had a certain homey (Singapore momma cooking kind of homey) taste to it which tantalized my taste buds and my memories. Loved it. It's a keeper for the menu.

It's also very popular, clearly, for good reasons.

Yet I can't help but feel the drinks are rather hit or miss. I understand they take their mixology very seriously and like at everywhere else, I entrust the satiation of my thirst to them to do whatever they heck they want. 

Half the time the drinks have been above average, but never great (hard to justify this sort of prices, esp now that they have soooo many worthy competitors). The other half of the time the drinks have just been downright abysmal.

My first time here was a busy Sat night. Even though we were there nearly at midnight, the place was busy, much too busy for the staff to cope. We ordered and waited, checked with the server and waited some more, and waited. The server ended up giving us a free shot of shoju each (which was nice..but we were really thirsty for our drinks!). We ended up getting our first drinks 1.15 hr later!

The next few times were pre-dinner drinks, so it was much better. and we got a seat at the bar, which guaranteed immediate attention. 

Drinks here are fancy...and sometimes a little too sweet for our liking. The place is homely and nice, with exposed brick walls and nice couches. Plus, it is set in a shophouse in the cool Haji Lane. To my angmo friends, it felt like their homes.

First, they are no bartenders, they are mixologists/scientists!  There is no menu. Rather, they start a conversation with you about your likes and dislikes are. From there they build you a custom, artesian cocktail. Their assortment of liquors are so eclectic, and diverse you may not recognize a single bottle on their shelves. My advice, be open and honest with your tastes and you will be rewarded!
The bar is not super obvious to find, but Yelp's map will get you really close. When the map says you are there, look up and there is a small ""Bar Stories"" sign. Look for a glass door and walk upstairs!  I recommend you sit at the at for the complete experience with the mixologists. That way you will get the ""story"" on how they are making you cocktail!

Since every cocktail is made to order, it's nice how they take the time to listen to your preferences and make something you'll enjoy. Just be quite specific about what you like so they can include all those elements. I find that they do very well with their fruit forward cocktails and have a penchant for burning herbs for that smoky flavor.

Bar Stories,Mark E.,20/3/2018,"Bar Stories is a very cool cocktail bar. Frequented by celebrities and without a menu, drinks are made based on your vague desires and the whims of the bartenders. 

This ultra-personalisation comes at a hefty price, alongside very slow service. The poor bartenders were completely rammed on the Saturday night, and seemed a little stressed out. We couldn't get another order in and - given every cocktail order was meant to be a cheerful negotiation - having cocktail makers who are overloaded makes the whole experience less pleasant.

I suspect if you came here on a quiet Sun-Weds night, this would be a chill 5* experience. The model just doesn't quite work - delicious though the cocktails are - when they're busy.",3,nightlife,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-qSEZqRc2Nbqu6JvlQz0yA/o.jpg,,Food & Beverage

Bar Stories,Jodi H.,8/4/2016,"NO MENU BARS are either a hit or miss.

Bar Stories was a fabulous discovery, but it wasn't all smooth sailing. Came here early on a Friday around 6PM and was surprised that no one else was in the upstairs bar! We're Americans, but it's way past the ""it's 5 o'clock somewhere"" people!! Hint: usually people don't go drinking until after 7:30PM we noticed

I loved their ambiance and setup. Haji Lane is known for being a #hipster part of Bugis, and it's packed with kitschy/kooky boutiques and trinket stores as well as poppin' and packed chill bars and outdoor happy hours. I've visited twice, and both times were full of laughing customers, beer drinking, and dart throwing (damn those kids!). Thankfully, Bar Stories is up above on the second floor and away from the loud EDM sloppy messes downstairs.

We were the first customers that late afternoon/early evening, and loved the wooden steps, AC, and loungey chairs. There was no menu, and basically my advice to you yelpers is to be very specific about what kind of drink you like. Cool, you like citrus? Well what kind? Grapefruit, lemon, orange, or pink lemonade? You like sweet? Well do you like peach, strawberry, cherry, or grape? I was looking for a tequila/mezcal drink with a refreshing and smoky hint to it, not sweet at all and not too citrus-y. I mentioned that I love blackberry and anything with berry in it. My bartender made me a delicious tequila drink with lemon juice, and lots of additional crazy going on with kaffir leaves (think thai food) and a dried bamboo for aesthetic! It was milky like foam texture on the surface, but a smooth and refreshing sipper. LOVE. Shoutout to the bartender...even though it took literally 15-20 minutes, it was worth the wait.

My sister's drink wasn't as well received. I'm chuckling as I think back to it, but the bartender that day said that he was going to make it with peach and vodka, since she wanted a vodka drink that was sweet. He also mentioned another fruit that she liked and she though COOL, rad. I love all those things. Oh boy, the final combination was a cherry bomb of Kool-Aid flavor. Not the business. We felt bad asking him to remake it since each drink averaged around $19-$25, and that's an insane price! Even when I go out in San Francisco, I wouldn't dream of paying over $18 for a beautifully-crafted cocktail. But Singapore has different standards, as I came to understand throughout my stay.

Service is pretty much in the creation of your drink. They spend a solid 20 minutes on your drink, but there aren't cocktail servers walking around since the space itself is pretty tiny. In addition to the main space by the bar, there was also a back room that holds larger parties. But I can definitely see this place crowding up when it gets packed! It can be a great spot for a intimate conversation or even a small gathering for a GNO, but personally I wouldn't squeeze up in here with a large party...too much work to get everybody up in the birdhouse!",4,nightlife,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_U8Gh8JmhPdxo-30_tDjMw/o.jpg,"(L) peach/apricot vodka base, we tasted HELLA cherry.

Bar Stories,Chad M.,21/11/2012,"Had a great time at this place. Always love finding a place with well-mixed cocktails, where the bartenders do actually care about what they're creating, and not just making a few bucks between here and grad school.

Few disclaimers:
1. We went on a Sunday night, and there were only 6 people in the entire place.
2. It was on a business trip...so we weren't so concerned with the price

Menu
There's no menu as some of the other reviews mentioned, so you'll start by telling the bartender (""mixologist"" if you're fancy) the flavors you like, and the liquor. Let them know if you want something sweet or a bit more boozey too.  That will help you out. If you don't like your first cocktail - tell them what you didn't like. They're not offended, but will use that info to make you something better for round two.

Atmosphere
I'm not sure the name of our bartender, but we had a good time hanging out at the bar.  They're great to talk with...especially if you're a fan of a well-mixed cocktail.  The place is cozy - kind of at a random spot hidden in Haji Lane, but as some other reviewers mentioned, it's very small.  Probably would impact service, especially because all of the drinks are unique in some way. It's a low-key place too...rustic modern, so wear your skinny jeans and a button down with suede shoes. You'll fit right in haha. Just kidding - wear whatever you want. It's not a pretentious place.

I have a few survival tips to get good treatment at this bar.
1. Don't order a classic cocktail. You can tell them you like the flavors in a gin and tonic, but what's the point of going to a bar like this and ordering something you could get at every bar in the world? Let them do what they do best - create cocktails.
2. Don't order anything with vodka. I personally don't drink vodka, and I don't have anything against it...but in the craft cocktail world, nothing makes a bartender's eyes roll than when you ask for vodka.

Looking for adventure? Tell them you like spice. If you're never had a cocktail with muddled thai chilis, you should try one ASAP.",4,nightlife,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Jf4d31R48CLRsfCdSsbzhA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Al2frFvbluTnLnqBBcsn0w/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/K2AdrsclKEFN1xvUFKHefw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bYxGXUdamWCvnpP7yY3e3A/o.jpg,The entrance to Bar Stories...a bit tough to spot!; The bar in front.; Working his magic.; Round one!,Food & Beverage

Bar Stories,Claire H.,9/2/2014,"Wow, what an experience. 

It's not often that you go into a bar and end up having a sipping the drink of the patrons next to you - and you're not drunk! But wow, the peanut butter, ice-cream, bourbon concoction was so damn good, it had to be shared!! 

I'd heard good things about Bar Stories... no menu, interactive, you just tell the staff 'what you feel like'. Our descriptions ranged from ""tropical spicy"" to ""a manly drink"" and ""something with passionfruit"", and Zach and Tilo (name?) managed to hit the spot every time. 

Sitting at the bar was fun and entertaining... we made friends with our new neighbors and the staff. I don't think the experience is for everyone though... it's pretty intense and full on, so if you want just a quiet drink - I'd advise sitting at a table in a corner. But it was so refreshing to have this interaction and watching them make the drinks was almost as good as drinking them! 

Yes it is a little pricey but not outrageous...approx $25 per cocktail and they don't skimp on effort, ingredients or quality and we were definitely a little 'happy' on our way to our dinner reservations. Zach was an absolute star and the couple next to us wanted to take him home to Australia to be the cocktail specialist at his 60th! 

The only reason it doesn't get a 5 stars? Two of the staff were obviously in a relationship which don't get me wrong, is fine... but it seemed a little unprofessional to watch them canoodling behind the bar while working... I actually felt a little awkward, like I was intruding on their private moments or something... it was just weird and seemed out of place.

Bar Stories,Mathias H.,11/1/2016,"Bar stories is clearly on of my favorite bars in Singapore. They are located on the 2nd floor of a building on the trendy Haji Lane in the Arab district. It is recommended to make reservations to be sure to get a spot here. I would also recommend bringing some extra clothes as they have really cranked up the air condition so irrespective of how warm it may be outside it is still chilly inside.

Once seated the friendly staff will discuss a bit what you like and what type of flavors you would like in your cocktail. I usually opt for something rum based and fresh and did so here as well. They also made sure to ask if there were any allergies or things we disliked and then they go to work. It seems they are fairly creative and they use a lot of fresh herbs and fruits.

I was very happy with my cocktail and so were all the others we were there with. Together with Long Play this would be my go to place on Haji Lane.",4,nightlife,,,Food & Beverage
Bar Stories,Madhuri I.,23/5/2014,"So no-menu bespoke cocktail bars are cropping up all over the city, and of course I have to visit them all.

Bar stories looked promising. In fact, the decor is remiscent of Maison Ikkoku which is another up and coming bar (some would even say it has arrived). We asked for drinks with pretty specific flavour profiles, and we got something that might have been acceptable, if not so watered down. It just had no soul - pardon my analogy - but like a brown girl trying to rap. Both our drinks.. it was a bit sad. 

But we persevered on and this time asked a different guy at the bar to make our drinks. Looks like the trick worked - the kaffir lime/grapefruit tequila sour that I got was was excellent - a salty bitterness to the drink, plenty of acid and complexity. My husband asked for a penicillin which was all smoke and no fire. They did serve it with an interesting garnish though: an orange slice with 8 clove buds set on fire with a brulee torch. It added a wonderful nose to the drink.. but didn't make up for its obvious flaws. My drink too came with the kaffir lime being bruleed - I guess the folks at Bar stories share my love for the flame torch.

If I find myself in Arab street and in a generous mood, I might give Bar Stories a try again. But for now.. I'm not recounting tales from this book.",3,nightlife,,,Food & Beverage

Bar Stories,Alexander L.,12/9/2013,"I know this bar is sort of a Singapore cocktail scene institution. I get that. When these guys opened up and started making specialist cocktails in a shophouse on Haji Lane, people were interested. It was different. It was quaint. It was cool.

But this is 2013 and Bar Stories has been eclipsed by the likes of Jigger & Pony, Horse's Mouth, Cufflink Club, etc. The drinks just aren't that great and they have a habit of making embarrassing missteps, like serving cocktails in martini glasses that have not been chilled properly.

Also, the ""no menu"" bullshit is starting to wear thin and if you want to be a specialist cocktail bar it is totally unforgivable that you only have two single malt whiskeys available on any given night. That there is shameful.

Moreover, you might offer patrons drinks with no name based on a flavour or a base spirit preference but if I order an old fashioned or a bloody mary and you don't execute well... why should I trust you with a random fruity concoction?

Sorry Bar Stories, every time I've been here I've been underwhelmed by the drinks and raised one eyebrow at ""the experience"". If friends drag me back here now I just order Macallan 12 on the rocks.

Bar Stories,Ben L.,23/1/2014,"I've gone a few times and had dramatically different experiences. I've had 5 star experiences and 2 star, so overall 4 stars seems to make sense. So the general jist of the place is you go in and you get asked a few questions about your drink preferences and the bar tenders come up with something.

So first, for my positive experiences, I've always sat at the bar and it has been on slower nights (Tuesdays and Thursdays usually from my experience). Actually getting to interact with the bartenders as they make your drinks really makes the experience worthwhile. They actually pry further into what you like and you get to watch all the theatrics that go into making the drinks. The ""wow"" factor is pretty big when you get your super elaborate drinks. From the service pieces (everything from martini glasses to mason jars), to garnishes (candy, smoke, foams, etc), to pyrotechnics, it's all pretty impressive. And the drinks do actually taste quite nice, and it's not all just a show.

So my more negative experiences have been on busy nights seated at a table. For one, the waiters usually don't try as hard at getting to know your drink preferences as the actual bar tenders. The wait time for the drinks is SUPER long. Finally, what sucks the most is when they get backed up they put FAR less effort into your cocktail. Basically you usually end up with a fruity martini or the likes - not necessarily bad, but just disappointing.

At over $20 a drink, the former experience I mentioned felt worth it, but the latter felt like a rip off. So if you can catch the place on a slow night I highly recommend it, but if it's busy pass for a different night.",4,nightlife,,,Food & Beverage
Bar Stories,Debbie T.,30/6/2013,"After my poor experience at Maison Ikkoku, Chris A. and I wandered over to Bar Stories. Our verdict? Much better! The atmosphere was more relaxed and not as pretentious. The waiter taking our order also took time to carefully walk us through our drinks to make sure our ""feelings"" or ""desires"" married well and that the end result didn't taste funny.

I came here again tonight with a few girlfriends and the bartenders truly took time to make our drinks extra special, from an ice sculpture to burning a rosemary candle! Our server also came by to shine a flashlight so we had proper lightening for pictures...thank you!

I do prefer the drinks at Maison Ikkoku though since they tend to be stronger. BUT, Bar Stories takes reservations on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, unlike Maison Ikkoku. Price point wise are about the same, roughly $25 per drink.

Bar Stories,Soile V.,12/3/2015,"Bar stories ranks perhaps as my number one cocktail bar in Singapore (maybe even the world). If you would ask my husband, he would prefer Longplay, but I am sure this place would not be long behind.

Bar stories is located on Haji lane, a street where the Western and Middle-Eastern cultures collide. There are many bars around with tourists and expats having drinks, but also bars that serve no alcohol to respect the Arab-heritage. Bar stories is located in the upstair of an old shop-house. Its not a speakeasy per-se, but it is not something you wonder into without knowing what it is. 

Upon entering we were greeted and seated at the end of the bar. I love a seat with a view! The concept was as in Bitters & Love, there is no menu, you explain to the bartender what you like and they will make you a drink. We went with our usual spirits of choice, me wit gin and my date with a dark rum. We are perhaps a bit boring, but it helps compare. Also I am really not fond of whiskey, cognac or vodka as a base. The bartender also asked some questions like do I like lemongrass and could I handle some egg white in my drink (YES!). 

I could already see from the equipment they had at hand that we were going to see some party tricks. I don't mind as long as my drink is good. My dates cocktail arrived with a flaming branch or rosemary, and mine with a long lemongrass sticking out of the Martini glass. Looking around others had pretty cool looking drinks as well, and none of them looked the same. The staff seemed to like experimenting and you could see they were having fun with it. The taste was wonderful, like a mix of a fresh breeze and dessert (due to the creaminess of the egg white) with spices on top. 

We only had one round of drinks this time, but I can imagine I could have sat there sipping on cocktails for a full evening. The ambience was charming and relaxed and the cocktails excellent. As with many nice bars these days, it is possible to reserve a table (I remember the days in Finland when it cost something and you only got a crappy bottle of Absolute Vodka and some mixers as ""compensation""). There doesn't seem to be any food or snacks, so my recommendation would be to have dinner before going.

We made reservations for 2 for this cool place on Haji Lane, walked up the stairs and sat down in front of this cool lookin dude that looks like a mad genius. He asks us our names and what we like. He asked what flavors we wanted and we were off. There is an array of fresh local fruits and flavors to choose from.

I remember getting some cool version of the negroni with his twist on it. My girlfriend got a lemongrass tea cocktail with tequila. Not only were the drinks excellent and beyond creative, but so was the presentation. Hers came in a tea pot with a mini tea cup. Mine was a cool glass that I can't describe. So much detail involved with flavor that you just will not find anywhere else in the world. That's the beauty of this place.

It's small, intimate and incredibly welcoming. Something not a lot of the 'cool' bars in Singapore can pull off. There is no menu, so everyone is treated to a personal cocktail consultation when they arrive, asking you whether you prefer sweet or sour, fruity, strong flavors etc until they have an idea of your palate tastes.

You can then sit and watch as great care is taken over the mix and the presentation of your drink, they are served in a wide variety of glasses, jars, bottles to make you feel very special. My drinking partner's whiskey based cocktail for example came complete with a beautiful small paper boat containing some crystallized ginger.

I also had a raspberry, ginger, and basil cocktail that was really good. My boyfriend had a Penicillin- a smokey whiskey drink and then had a passion fruit whiskey-based cocktail with rhubarb bitters that he thoroughly enjoyed.

The concept with this bar is no menus, just a discussion with the bartender and a customized drink is brought out for you. In my many visits here I have only had one less than stellar visit and that was because our particular bartender that night, just didn't interact well with us, not fun, good drinks, but not exciting. Every other visit is fun with the bartender discussing your tastes and pushing you to try something new and expand your tastes.
The service is above and beyond, in fact, one visit my wife was explaining that she doesn't like Gin, and a voice from across the room yelled out ""You do too, like Gin, the last two times you were here I served you Gin"" Two things about this, 1) We are not THAT regular, but they remembered us 2) They push you to try new things that even you don't realize you like. 
The drinks are not just mixed cocktails, but they are complete experiences, a table of four will likely have something flaming, some herb or unique fruit and maybe even a merengue. 
No two visits are the same and no two drinks are the same, it is a great experience and definitely a place to go with friends you will share drinks with to try it all.

Bar Stories,Sam S.,30/9/2014,"Been to Bar stories many times, and used to ends up being a very memorable experience. Chic setting, great bar counter, and chatty bartenders spinning up very creative drinks... a visual delight and great tasting cocktails!
HOWEVER...changes in staff? and or management? or just the attitude... makes this the worst place to step into.

For us, a hope for great evening hosting a visiting friend turned into a nightmare. First, the bartender was plain rude, refusing to seat us by the bar counter. Why - some (new, and very random) rule about not letting over 3 people of a group at the bar. Thats ok...if it's a fairly busy time. This was monday evening..and with literally 2-4 other customers during the entire time! so we were sent packing to a dingy corner, away from the action and fun. This 'rule' was visibly random, targeted, and new for us regulars who have enjoyed multiple fun nights at the bar counter, in more crowded nights, and in larger numbers. But hey, who are we to say...just customers (which means nothing to the 'cool n chic' bar stories staff)

Then came the order taking...also usually a delightful process of interaction with the (used to be) social, friendly staff. This guy chose to take our orders from his pedestal at the bar counter, several feet away from us. Upon requesting politely, he obliged to come closer to us to have a 'conversation' as the order process here tends to be.

Next on delivering the cocktails...he concocted and brought the first ones out. Now, to the very common, and genuine qn from my friend ""is this mine?"" (bcos you dont know what shape, color, or style your drink at bar stories could be..thats part of the 'fun', the bartenders response was 'why would i put it in front of you otherwise?!'

Jigger and Pony,Max M.,11/7/2024,"Visited Jigger and Pony in Singapore for the first time in June 2024. Made an evening reservation online a couple weeks in advance for a party of 4. The venue is located inside of the Amara hotel and was easy to find from the lobby. I had very high expectations for visiting Jigger and Pony which was ranked the #2 bar in Asia. The service, drinks, and overall vibes of the bar completely exceeded my expectations! Our host was Aldrich who was honestly one of the best we have ever had. He was super fun, knowledgeable, and went above and beyond multiple times. From providing us birthday shots for one of our party members, to providing recommendations around the area, to even getting us signed copies of their most recent cocktail menu from their staff, he truly made our experience incredible! The cocktails were so good as well. My party had extensively explored many of the top bars around Hong Kong and Singapore and my favorite by far was Jigger and Pony. The team there is amazing and I recommend anyone in the area to pay them a visit!",5,nightlife,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/G19jhFhDUM2fq5m-mGCLMg/o.jpg,,Food & Beverage

The ambiance is lounge-y and very cool. The service is impeccable, our server Eldridge really took care of us. The drinks were unbelievably delicious. Eldridge talked us through the menu, and as a big fan of Whisky, I started with The Godfather. A drink so delicious, I'm going to have dreams about it, until my next trip! 

Up next? Tequila, but of course. I ordered the White Toreador. An excellent drink, but now I kind of wish I ordered The Godfather again, lol.

Jigger and Pony,Roger P.,7/2/2023,"At the time of visit, Jigger and Pony was one of the top 50 bars in the world and it definitely shows! Reservations are a must and I snagged one for 6 people through their website. There's no dress code but because of the fancy-ish decor, I'd recommend having something a little nicer on. 

Their cocktail menu was presented in a magazine and it looked so legit! The first couple pages list all the drinks and our waitress explained that the drinks get stronger as you go down the chart. The rest of the magazine gives more details on each cocktail and there's even a section for punch bowls at the very end. You can even buy the magazine as a souvenir!

Sakura Martini: Being a martini, this drink was really strong. I mean, straight up alcohol. The gin is infused with Sakura and the drink comes with a little Sakura flower on the bottom. I kind of remember it being slightly sweet but the alcohol really overpowers everything. 

Ichigo Bowl: It's about 15-20 servings, depending how generous you are with your scoop. Definitely more than enough for a group of 6, especially since we each got our own drink on top of this. Our waitress was very attentive and kept refilling our cups through the night. I really enjoyed this drink and everyone was either too full or drunk by the end. 

It gets really cold in there, at least maybe because our spot was next to an AC vent. Other than that, the drinks were great, the service was amazing, and we even got some great recs from our waitress for NYE festivities.

Jigger and Pony,Calvin C.,23/6/2023,"Cute spot! We had to wait about 45mins for a group of 6. It's in a hotel lobby so we chilled there. They don't really take your number so we primarily stayed there. The host did suggest us to check out another bar, but unfortunately the ones that were close by were closing soon.

Upon walking in (up the stairs), the atmosphere was dim and loungey. There are a lot of communal tables, a bar area, and small tables for the different groups. It doesn't seem like a place to go alone (more for groups). We were in the back and by the AC so it was very cold. We didn't know this until the end, but you can request blankets. And you should because they were comfy.

Jigger and Pony,Caili C.,29/11/2022,"Great speakeasy with a nice atmosphere that's comfortable and spacious with art deco vibes. We were excited to try this bar after seeing it on the 50 best bars list and came to check this out on our recent trip to Singapore. Their menu puts a twist to classic cocktails and we love looking through the booklet which acts as a menu with a background on each drink.

We're not heavy drinkers so stuck with the lighter cocktails. We got the yuzu whisky sour with the corn colada for round 1. I really loved the whisky sour but the corn colada lacked the corn punch I expected from trying other corn-based cocktails in the past. It tasted mostly of pineapple but did have a buttery taste similar to popcorn. We also tried the jasmine rice which was good but didn't have much jasmine flavor. 

Overall, a nice spot to go to with friends. It's fun and ritzy without being too stuffy which is great.",4,nightlife,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QZesffu-icv2Uis-VcQ4CQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/192RTaBTEwS-ZMMdcbymHA/o.jpg,"Yuzu Whiskey Sour, Corn Colada",Food & Beverage
Jigger and Pony,Thuy Dan T.,1/6/2023,"Currently on the World's 50 Best Bars at #12 and Asia's 50 Best Bars at #2.

Located in the Amara hotel right off the main lobby. The bar area is dimly lit for that vibey atmosphere. A hostess greets you and there's some lounge corners, a long communal table, the bar, and some additional seating a few stairs up. I recommend making a reservation if you're able to. Each cocktail is $28 SGD and then with service charge, GST fees, $33+ SGD per drink, so a pretty penny. 

For a group of two coming at 7:30PM on a Wednesday, it was quite packed, but we were able to get a couple of seats at the bar. The menu is designed like a magazine for each drink and the front page has the table of contents in a grid table with the lightest alcohol content (or mocktails) on the top row to the highest percentage on the last. Then the columns I think are based on specific taste preference like sweet, sour, etc. 

Our server Gerald was amazing - friendly, knowledgeable, and good conversation! Everyone was very friendly and seeing the bartenders do their craft was really fun.

We tried Soy Milk Punch, Godfather, Greatest of All Time, and Ramos Gin Fizz. I like the Soy Milk Punch the best with the egg white foam top which was delicious.

We wanted to try some of the food items but we're running on a tight schedule. Definitely a spot for elevated cocktails and good vibes to hang out with friends in Singapore!",4,nightlife,,,Food & Beverage

Their atmosphere is energetic and creates for excellent people watching. My only potential note would be that they keep it cold. Not cool, cold. They do offer shaws and blankets if necessary.

Jigger and Pony,Steph C.,17/12/2024,"Jigger & Pony has the #5 spot on The World's 50 Best Bars list, so when we found ourselves staying a short walk away, we decided to check it out. The place takes reservations, and we grabbed the only one available, for a midnight seating. Crazytown for a couple of middle-aged parents, but we were only in Singapore for one night. We napped during the day and showed up ten minutes early.

The bar was on the lobby level of the Amara hotel, and we were welcomed in as soon as we arrived. It was a fun spot, attractive and lively, definitely a scene. I appreciated that the reservation came with seating, two stools right at the bar. There were three or four bartenders behind there at any given time, and they were young and friendly and seemed to be having a blast. I really liked the guy making our drinks, a sweet Korean dude who's lived in Singapore most of his life.

We ordered our cocktails from a beautiful ""menuzine,"" a full-color book with a page dedicated to each drink. The cocktails were quite elaborate, with tons of ingredients and complicated processes. We are the correct audience for this sort of over-the-top mixology, but to our surprise, the results were not entirely successful. The one I take issue with is the Perfect Manhattan, made with Woodford Reserve rye, Carpano Antica, Mancino Secco, stracciatella, and chocolate bitters. The rye was fat-washed with stracciatella ice cream, and the whole thing was garnished with a chocolate cherry. This sounded interesting, but was weirdly less tasty and balanced than the Manhattans we make at home, also with rye and Carpano.

I did like our other three cocktails. The Ugly Tomatoes was nice, lightly sweet and savory, with Hendrick's Orbium gin, ugly tomatoes, kummel, and elderflower. The Yuzu Whisky Sour was solid, with Maker's Mark bourbon, yuzu marmalade, St. Germain, lemon, and egg white. The Peaches & Daisies was a lovely refreshing cocktail with Nikka Coffey grain whisky, lacto-fermented peach, cranberry, chamomile, and lemon.

We had a great time at Jigger & Pony, and I'd recommend it if you want a happening bar where you can sit and enjoy a fancy cocktail. Is it the fifth-best bar in the world? Probably not. But the drinks are unique and the vibes are good.",4,nightlife,,,Food & Beverage

The menu is a hardcover magazine like booklet that explains the bar and the drinks, there is also a page with all the drinks listed as a grid. The top row
Is least alcoholic and the bottom row is the most boozy.
The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. The bar tenders do make some amazing drinks and they make their takes on classics as well.
They also serve small bites like crab dip, impossible meat flatbreads and so on.
The music is really good here as well and I can't really explain the style. It sounded like a modern take on big band and swing music but it sounded great, it is loud in there.

Jigger and Pony,Margaret C.,23/2/2023,"The decor wasn't what I expected, office lounge vibes but the cocktails are amazing. I got the Negroni which was excellent and the espresso martini which was the best espresso martini I ever had. 

The mixologist really spent his time crafting the cocktail, from the way he custom cut the block of ice to fit the glassware to resting a thin chocolate circle on top of the foam. I was given a wooden spoon and instructed to tap the chocolate circle to crack it into my drink. 

We also ordered some side dishes - charcuterie board, sausage and mash potatoes, olives and hummus. They also provided us complimentary tapioca chips and a roadie shot to go.

You walk into this old school, dark lounge and you feel like you have been taken back to the 20's a bit. There ton's of seating in the main bar area or up the stairs in the back, this place is quite popular so sometimes seating might be difficult to find. 

I am not big on getting mixed drinks, however when you come here how can you not?! I loved every drink I got, between my husband, friends and myself seemed like we had half the bar menu. The menu is really original as well, it's put together in a magazine/booklet form. I love it!

We had the following: 
Java Cooler: Tanqueray London Dry Gin, sesame, calamansi, Fever Tree Aromatic Tonic- light and tasty! 

June Bug: Hwayo 25 Soju, Koko Kanu Coconut Rum, homemade midori, awamori, lemon, egg white- This is a little sweet with the coconut rum, the egg whites gives the drink the froth on the top. 

Williams Cooler: Vedrenne Poire Williams, Capovilla Pere Williams, jasmine orris liqueur, lime, soda- This one was my favorite, there isn't too much to this one, light and fresh!

Yuzu Whiskey Sour: Bulleit Bourbon, yuzu marmalade, St Germain, lemon, egg white: Very similar to a whiskey sour

Jigger and Pony,Jeff C.,18/7/2014,"This is a rock star bar with rock star cocktails. Everything here from the mixers to the spirits screams premium, so you had better be prepared to pay premium prices (around $22 Singapore for most cocktails); however, what you will get for you hard- earned dollar is an excellent cocktail and perhaps something you have never heard of before.

I saw a copy of bar PDT's cocktail guide, so it is obvious that this bar staff is taking a page from one of New York's legendary bars. Yup, win best bar in the world and you can pretty much call your bar legendary. It appears as if these guys have their eyes set on the prize, and the only area that I can see that they have to work on is customer interaction; they spent a great deal of effort making the drinks to perfection but it would have been nice to see some more flare, and a bit moe personality behind the bar.

Jigger and Pony,Grant L.,24/3/2020,"Didn't know a ton about Jigger and Pony but it got an endorsement from the Employees Only staff so certainly worth dropping in. The bar is relatively easy to find (as far as Singapore goes - no hidden doors or tricks involved) and is a very lovely set up. Its mid-century but dialed back a bit so it doesn't feel kitschy. 

The staff was awesome, all happy to chat, talk cocktails and shoot the breeze. The drinks were fun and well crafted but still approachable. One of the drinks was a riff on a Korean TGIFridays drink but with homemade Midori. I know this might not sound amazing, but it was a near perfect drink. It was well crafted, nuanced, and still managed to not take itself too seriously. I'm so glad I was able to make it into Jigger and Pony and wish I had shown up earlier in the night so I had time to try a couple more drinks. I would even consider staying in the Amara Singapore hotel above the bar just to maximize my drink time.",5,nightlife,,,Food & Beverage
Jigger and Pony,Riva L.,9/5/2016,"This is the BEST cocktail bar I have ever been to. We went on a Thursday night and it was surprisingly quite empty -- not that we minded! We started out with the Corpse Reviver and the Moscow Mule. I had the former and it's probably my new favorite cocktail ever. The presentation is great - I love the beautiful jelly - and the cocktail itself is a masterpiece. The jelly tastes like absinthe, but better, and it melts in your mouth  when you sip this sour, refreshing drink. The Moscow Mule was also excellent - a perfectly done Moscow Mule, and very gingery.

For round two, we opted for Bad Blood and the Butterfly Effect. However, they were actually out of Bad Blood. I was pretty bummed, mostly because I had very much wanted a drink in one of those cute pineapple cups!! So, the bartender was awesome enough to make me a different drink, not on the menu, in that cup. He asked my drink preferences specifying that It had to contain absolut elyx. What I got was an incredible, tart and fresh elder flower cocktail with real flowers in it! I was so impressed by the bartender and waitress' efforts to go above and beyond to make sure I had a happy experience. It made the night even better to have such great service (in addition to amazing cocktails). The Butterfly Effect was also excellent - the flavors were very complex and the drink was very strong!

Again, this was probably the best cocktail experience I've ever had, due to the combo of amazing drinks and stellar service.

They do bespokes well here, and I've been moderately satisfied with my drinks, given that bespoke drinks are sort of a wild card. The crowd here is mostly CBD types, with some couples here and there. I like to sit in their booths, where there is privacy and comfort.

They provide complimentary tapioca chips. I suggest you don't eat them, because once you start, you really can't stop. Price-wise I am not sure, but I assume that this is a 25 per cocktail sort of place. The AC can be a bit of downer at times.",3,nightlife,,,Food & Beverage

At Jigger and Pony, the two things are a great selection of Japanese scotch and free bar snacks (the chips are addictive!) :).

We went for happy hour - 6-8pm means a selection of their drinks are SG$14 instead of SG$22, and there are also discounts on their snacks. As we enjoyed our drinks, we watched the bartenders finish preparing all the fruit garnishes and the hand-chipped ice blocks. 

We had a great chat with some of the staff about various gins, small-batch producers, and the industry as a whole... these folks aren't just phoning it in - they love what they do. My favourite drink was the Sakura Sakura - just a right amount of sweetness, but they will also create something to your taste - just tell them what you like.

The snacks were also good.  The deconstructed cypress skewers were just ok, but the friend pickles were excellent. It was a huge bowl of tempura'd pickles veggies with a delicious creamy dipping sauce,  And the chicken meatballs with cheese sauce made us want to lick the plate.

I liked the atmosphere, we sat at the bar and it was nice to watch the bar tenders but more importantly, I think they did a pretty decent job with the cocktails. I am typically not very adventurous when it comes to cocktails, I like to stick to what I know so I went for an Old Fashioned and was not disappointed. 

I am doubting between 3 or 4 stars but the fact that they have a stocked a decent variety liquors and a seemingly well thought of menu (not only overly sweet concoctions - yay) makes me lean towards 4 stars. I also noticed that their menu has quite a selection of punch bowls, I haven't seen that in too many other bars in Singapore. Unfortunately, we didn't go for them as it was only the two of us and we already had our fair share of drinks before, but they looked quite attractive and this gives them that little edge which will make me come again.",4,nightlife,,,Food & Beverage

Jigger and Pony,Alexander L.,14/8/2013,"I have been a regular patron at this bar for over a year now. I come here more often than I would like to readily admit on social media (no I am not an alcoholic... I hope). Fundamentally I come for the holy trifecta of hospitality: the drinks, the atmosphere & the service. Jigger & Pony scores highly on all fronts.

As far as the drinks go, these are some of the best classic cocktails you're likely to find this side of Japan. If an Old Pal demands 240 stirs then 240 stirs it shall receive. What is the appropriate type of brown spirit to use in an Old Fashioned? Talk to the bar manager and he will sort you out based on your palate. Whiskey sour with egg white or without egg white? It's all good over here.

Mixing booze into glasses with garnishes and serving them at $20++ is a dicey thing to do. People have different tastes, you can't please everyone and for that kind of money they will have higher expectations. But having extreme attention to detail, akin to a cocktail Zen Master, and politely inquiring about your patrons' pre-existing tastes and cocktail prejudices certainly goes a long way.

Moreover the atmosphere at Jigger is excellent. It's rarely completely dead but never too crowded. The booths are very comfortable to sit for hours with a group of friends. The light is not too bright, not too dim and the music is at an appropriate volume for ambiance but doesn't kill conversations.

The service is friendly, polite and sometimes firm (but considering the horrors hospitality staff have to deal with this seems appropriate). The staff at Jigger will do their best to accommodate your requests as long as you're polite and understanding. Want to sit at the bar and talk the bartender's ear off? Sure, why not. 

When I started going to this place I knew none of the people that worked there (full disclaimer for bias-reporting purposes) but since being a regular there for over a year I consider them my friends. And that should be every man's relationship with the people that serve his liquor.",5,nightlife,,,Food & Beverage

That's how I feel about 70% of the restaurants and bars I visit these days in Singapore. A lot of hype and not much substance. So imagine my surprise this Thursday evening, when I found myself free from the clutches of a weekly Eastern time conference call and at the bar enjoying every minute.

Jigger & Pony won a toss up with Axis bar and for strange line of logic I won't explain here, J&P won. So I got on the phone to make a reservation. A cheerful and organized lady took my reservation, with surprise surprise, no need for gimmicky passwords, directions down Chinese streets or better yet, an answering machine with an elusive number. I ended up arriving half an hour late and my better half was at the table, grinning. That's a very good sign after a work day. He blurted out that the drinks were great, the menu actually listed good liquors by name,  the ice was hand cut AND they were serving delicious food samples. 

So there we were: 3 people, 9 drinks later and two 180g steaks (at $24 a steal, but its a rump/sirloin). We sampled almost half the aperitif selection and 2 classic cocktails and though some of us didn't take too well to 1-2 flavors, the flavor combinations were spot on. Forgive me for forgetting names but the grapefruit drink was genius (though not everyone's cup of tea) and I loved the Cuba Libre and American Lemonade (yes I like a tart profile in my drinks). This is one of those bars where the technique is miraculously consistent and you're allowed to enjoy your drink without pretense. That made my day.

Service was prompt, but the kitchen forgot our second steak order for a bit. Seats were comfortable and spaced well, the music and artwork was on trend but not jarring and the bathrooms were as clean as they will ever get for a bar. That the drinks were $14-22 was icing on the cake.

Jigger and Pony,Sonya C.,22/11/2014,"noisy, boisterous, hip cocktail bar in amoy street. depending on your age (mental or biological), you'll either love this place or hate it.

I used to love it - I came here when cocktail bars were still fresh and new, and it introduced me to the spumoni, a grapefruit-based cocktail that was imminently drinkable. it was loud-buzzy, which is to say that you could still lean over for conversation, and there was opportunity to speak to the person actually making your drinks.

flash three years or so ahead to my latest visit about a month ago - and boy, are things different. the noise level is exponentially magnified, the place is filled with younger ladies dressed rather minimally (by which I mean amount of cloth rather than aesthetic style), and it's almost impossible to get service.

in its defense, it's still buzzy (though in an almost clubby, out to have a GREAT time sort of way), and nice if you're out for a loud night out. but if you don't want to shout  (and still not be able to make yourself heard), I'd choose somewhere else.

Nothing has caught me off guard in terms of atmosphere, patrons, drinks or even bar snacks - but expect wanker bankers.  Steady Freddy all the way.    

The bad:  But that's just it, there isn't a je ne sais quoi.  It's a combination of good elements that just don't quite bring me to bar euphoria.  It's like the England national football team, or the latest apple product, or all your favorite sodas spashed together in one cup.  It should be perfect, it should be bliss...but it isn't and no one knows why.  I'm not suggesting that it's too much of a good thing...it's just nothing great.  

The ugly:  I've been here numerous times and this is how I would describe it:  Sitting in a bathtub just when the water starts to get cold.  You don't want to get out, so you pour more hot water in (alcohol) but eventually you have to leave and no matter how good it felt when you first got in you're left with the memory of luke warm water.

Jigger and Pony,Melissa H.,30/11/2013,"I've been here twice.

First time wasn't so impressive because we came in late and I was sitting at the edge of someone's table in a crowded cocktail bar. So i left and forgot about this place for a few months.

Fast forward nine months later, i was entertaining a visiting exec and was tasked with finding the venue. Jigger & Pony constantly came up as recommended place, so i figured - why not, i'll give them a proper chance. So off we went, a party of 8 seated at one of their booths. It was comfortable enough seating but the table did get a bit crowded once we started ordering food.

Food was great. we ordered meatballs, cold cut platter and and some sort of cheese melted on top of bread (but i forgot the name of this dish). All of them turned out excellent - far exceeded my expectation for bar food. Aside of this, they also constantly bring in free small sandwiches for you to nibble on. Other bars should take note of this - people love free food no matter how simple they are.

Cocktails were amazing - i get why they're named as one of the best cocktail bars in town. They have a selection of pre-dinner cocktails for $14 (usually $20) until 8pm, which i think is a total steal for the quality. I would recommend Moscow Mule (ginger beer!), Lavender Gimlet (gin and lavender) and Darjeeling Cooler.

The ambience and music makes it perfect for an after-work place, and you do see those type of people here especially with the place being so close to CBD. It reminds me of 28 hks minus the speakeasy factor. On top of that, service was top notch! We never felt neglected despite the place being pretty much full on Friday night.

Jigger and Pony,Skii C.,10/8/2012,"This new, swanky establishment housed in a shophouse has a bartender that whips up a mean cocktail. Their focus is on craftsmanship and the personalized quality of each customer's drink. 

Much thought has been put into the deco of Jigger and Pony. The red and yellow seats were a result of an influence of Madrid and Barcelona, and the spare walls have been plastered with vintage French alcohol posters. The main line of inspiration comes from Japan, where Anthony's techniques and influences clearly come from Japan, where he once worked before. 

Its drinks menu comes in a grid-format, subdividing the squares into 24 $20 cocktails which will get you checking off those boxes. They are classified into 3 main simple categories, namely: Classic, Forgotten and Modern Twist. Try out ""Negroni"" which is crowd favourite. This blood-red drink has a slight bitterness, fortunately it's being softened and complemented with the orange zest.

Jigger and Pony,Shawn B.,9/9/2015,"I'm afraid to give reviews to these prohibition style bars like these since they are fueled by passion from the owners. Also, as far as drinks go, it really is ""to each their own"", everyone has different tastes in what they like.

For me, unfortunately, I felt this is one of those spots thats replaceable with any other one that is identical to it - those that have a bunch of different type of whiskeys, gin, rum etc, and also can create all of your typical old fashioneds, Manhattans, Gin and Tonic, Negroni, etc etc. I lived in New York for many years and there are dozens like this. Even here in Singapore you can hop to any of the other ""speakeasies"" around and get identical drinks and setting.

The ambiance and staff are beyond cool for sure. It's just that my girlfriend and I both had cocktails that weren't good at all. She had two different types and both tasted almost like medicine (one was the SG50 special cocktail called Little Red Dot or something). I had two different types, and both were pretty bad (one was called Donkey Kong and it tasted a bit off but I drank anyways), one I even sent back (the one that is milky and tastes like a sugary and heavier version of a White Russian), and I know I don't have that picky of a palette.

The chips are, however, contagious as many other Yelpers have mentioned. Very very good.

This would be a great place if you and your date or friend or group were coming to hang out after work in that area and sticking with your classic cocktails. Ambiance is excellent.

Jigger and Pony,Ai Lin M.,9/9/2012,"There's some degree of hype that accompanies Jigger and Pony because 1) it's the new kid on the block in an up and coming neighbourhood and 2) the bartenders were trained in Japan and make classic cocktails that are simple in appearance but purportedly big on taste. 

Despite all these elements, I have to say that I wasn't especially impressed. The interiors are beautiful, that's for sure, but they are also cold and impersonal. The cocktails are nice enough, but I wasn't blown away. 

I must say, though, that the service is excellent, and the staff was very attentive. However, I really don't foresee myself making this a regular haunt of mine.",3,nightlife,,,Food & Beverage

Not super lively but it was still early on a Wednesday.  The first thing to notice is the staff is very attentive.  They seem to take pride in serving up what you like similar to Bar Stories.  They have a large list of interesting cocktails.  They arent cheap but theyre well made. happy hour prices are better if youre around at that time.  It seemed like a nice, quiet unassuming spot for a drink. I'm sure its more crowded on the weekend. They have some food but I didnt try it. Although they do serve up some tasty chips to snack on while you drink.  Overall I'd say its a nice place, with nice staff and good drinks.

Jigger and Pony,X C.,19/10/2012,"I love this place! I was there for the first time last night, Thursday, and it was perfect - the music was good and turned up to just the right volume level that allowed you to get into the mood of the place and yet hear your conversations. There was a good size crowd of people, but not overwhelming. And what I appreciate most about this place is that it's not pretentious like what way too many other bars can be. It looks classy primarily because of the beautiful glowing lights from the bar, but yet it's also grungy at the same time. Very nice!

I first ordered the Paper Plane, as recommended by the guy who served us. He started off by asking my go-to alcohol of choice. For that night, it was bourbon. His description of the drink was succinct and descriptive enough for me to get a feel of what to expect. And true enough, the drink was tasty!

So as I was contemplating another drink and perusing through the menu again, the lady who made my Paper Plane came by to ask if she could help recommend something for me. Surprisingly she recommended the exact two choices I had just managed to narrow down myself - the Corpse Reviver and the King Cole - she read my mind! So I ordered the King Cole. It was simple and had just the right amount of kick to it, the perfect followup to my Paper Plane.

I look forward to going back again!",5,nightlife,,,Food & Beverage

Jigger and Pony,A K.,9/10/2015,"I have been to Jigger on a number of occasions now and usually we turn a blind eye to the over-priced cocktails (I mean, it is Singapore) because of the great vibes and ambiance. However, on my most recent visit, we were treated with one of the worst service experiences I have had in Singapore. I can usually turn a blind eye to over priced drinks and average quality, however, service is one factor that really makes or breaks it for me. 

Now, I'm not just talking about slow service or getting orders wrong or rude waiters, I am talking about it all... The lack of knowledge and unawareness of the waiters only become apparent when we asked for our bill at the end of the night. Firstly, we couldn't find a server to ask for the bill. When I went over to the cashier and asked them for our table's bill, they were unable to locate it, and apologized for being 'new' (I mean not everyone can be new now, can they?) They asked me to recount all the drinks we had and then attempted to re-do a bill. After this, it still took about 20 minutes for them to get us the bill and when they did, it was still wrong! They had charged us for a bottle that was not even ours. At this time, I was dealing with one of the servers who seemed to be pretty unaware and didn't really have a clue what was going on, moreover, he had no respect for his customers and spoke to me in the rudest manner possible and was actually yelling at me... I am not sure if he had been drinking on the job or he has no manners, both of which are terrible, but I have never been spoken to like this in my life and it was really the last straw for me. I am sorry, but Jigger has now been boycotted by me and my friends. I refuse to sponsor an institution which has zero regard for its customers and no sense of how to talk to a fellow human being. I am usually ok to deal with slow service, but we will not stand for ineptitude and downright rudeness. 

By the way, even after all this, they bought us the wrong bill and overcharged us..........at which point we were so done that we just paid and got the hell out of the place.",1,nightlife,,,Food & Beverage

Long Bar,Jacky C.,2/4/2024,"Stopped by here for the famous Singapore Sling. There was a 30 minute wait when I arrived. Once it was our turn to be seated, we were escorted to the 2nd floor. Beautiful interior and peanut shell shattered all over the floor. Dress code I'd say is smart casual, but didn't really see anyone get turned away at the door, although you'll stick out like a sore thumb for underdressing.

The Singapore Sling was SG$39, which is not cheap, but it is a healthy serving in what looks like a 16 oz glass. You can also get the mocktail version of the Sling, called the Teetotaller's Sling for $16, which my gf opted for. Free peanuts served and yes, throwing the shells on the floor is encouraged.

There's a 10% service charge and 9% GST is not included in the pricing.",4,nightlife; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage
Long Bar,Donna B.,14/1/2024,"Birth place of the Singapore Sling.

Located on the second floor of the Raffles Hotel, just look for the line. I arrived around 5 pm on a week night and the line was out the door and starting down the stairs. Don't give up.  Hang out and read the information boards on the hotel and the cocktail. The line actually moved pretty quickly, I waited about 20 minutes.  No bad. 
There are a lot of table seats, but I recommend bar seating.  The old school dark woods, tile floor, wicker chairs, and spiral staircase makes this a beautiful spot. 

They offer a full bar but the Singapore Sling is the main attraction. 
First created in 1915, when gentlemen could nurse their gin or whiskey, but women were served teas and fruit juices. Bartender Ngiam Tong Boon created a socially acceptable concoction that looked like fruit juice, pineapple and lime juices infused with gin, curaçao, Benedictine and grenadine and cherry liqueur. An instant hit. And still a hit today, tourists enjoy the taste for $39 US.

The Singapore Sling is SG$39 --wow, that's the most expensive drink I have ever paid for! Not gonna lie, the price tag kind of hurt. The drink itself wasn't too strong with fruity flavors.

Long Bar,Trina D.,10/10/2023,"One of the most touristy things you can do in Singapore is get the Singapore Sling from the Long Bar, where it was originally created. We heard about this from our tour guide the day before so while we were nearby  on our last day in Singapore, we decided to throw caution to the wind and go get one. Well, I'm not sure it was worth it. First of all, the line of tourists outside the Long Bar was lengthy, but once inside, the air conditioning was on full blast and we were able to cool down. My husband and I ordered just one Singapore Sling to share at a whopping $46 SGD, which was about $34 USD. It was probably the most expensive cocktail I've ever had to date without knowing the price up front. I mean, it was listed on the menu as such but when I was in line, I didn't know it. If I had known, I would have hit up a different bar elsewhere to have gotten a better cocktail at a less expensive price. I don't even like gin but as they say, ""when in Rome..."" 

The Long Bar is located inside the Raffles Hotel, one of the oldest, high-end hotels in Singapore. Its decor is reminiscent of a plantation with columns and shutters of yesteryear. There are peanut shells on the ground inside the bar which kind of cheapens the experience for me. I mean, if you're going to charge that much for a cocktail, please don't have patrons throw peanut shells on the floor.

The simple goal was to try out the Singapore Sling.  Reviews from friends and other online sources have been mixed.  So just before 5pm my friend and I headed for the bar.  Fortunately the bar was located outside of the Raffles Hotel proper otherwise no one but guests of the hotel can visit this bar.  I have noticed this questioning of visitors to a number of the hotels that seems to show a level of unfriendliness of Singapore.  Anyways back to the bar, there was a short queue outside the bar which lasted only a minute as we were brought upstairs to a small booth for two.  The insides reflect the vintage decor which has been modernized for current use.  Once can watch the bartender make six Singapore Slings all at once which begs the question, would they taste consistent or stay true in taste?  My friend ordered the Original Singapore Sling while I ordered the Raffles 1915 Gin Sling.  Here it is, taste wise I love the 1915 Gin Sling.  The flavors and taste of this drink was just perfect.  The Singapore Sling was fruity with a bitterness at the end that I did not like.

When you arrive you wait in a queue to be seated (reservations are only available for parties of 10 or more). The line moves incredibly fast. Once seated though, we waited approximately 15-20 minutes prior to asking someone to place our order. 

Our server seemed to be annoyed at our asking regarding drinks and didn't provide much insight. We obviously ordered the Singapore sling, as they say it originated here. To their credit, this was the only bar in Singapore where I enjoyed this drink. As well, we tried a second drink with gin and curry and it was a total miss for me. We were planning to get a second drink and buy the cup to take home, however our drinks were empty for quite some time and we couldn't find our server. We were here slightly over one hour and only able to have one drink in that time period before asking the manager to close our check out.

Long Bar,Christina P.,1/12/2022,"I had been meaning to hit up the originators of the Singapore Sling for years but either didn't have enough time or wasn't with the right people to appreciate some good old liquor history .

My husb and I came to Singapore as part of our honeymoon adventures. It was his first time in Singapore... And It. Was. On.

We walked up to the front of Raffles and one of the iconic front doormen kindly directed us towards Long Bar. It's a bit of a maze to get there but luckily there is plenty of signage and they're placed in perfectly strategic locations (like when there is a turn, long walkway where you're not sure if you missed it, and at the bottom of the stairs.

We loved the history displayed on the walls of the stairs leading up. We arrived around 2pm on a Thursday and were warmly greeted upon entering and shown to a small table for 2 in the middle of the room. We started our adventures with - of course - two Singapore Slings. Service was prompt, friendly, and the drinks were FABULOUS. Unsurprisingly, they're not cheap considering it's a historic bar, big tourist spot, and situated in the most famous (5-star) hotel in Singapore. The Slings were 37 SGD at the time of writing. You can pay 14 SGD to keep the glass.

We nommed heavily on the peanuts (which are free) and were happy to litter them on the floor - probably the only place in Singapore where littering doesn't come with a hefty fine!

For our second round we ordered the Golden Milk Punch and The Duke (named after John Wayne and comes with beef jerky as a garnish). Both were delicious!

Then we got the text that our hotel room was ready so we decided to end our cocktail adventures there and head back for a nap. We left around 330pm and passed a queue about 20 people deep waiting for a table. FYI, come early to avoid the wait.

Long Bar,Calvin C.,22/6/2023,"Long bar is at the Raffles Hotel. Note that the security around the hotel will not allow non-hotel guests into the hotel. To get to Long Bar, you have to venture around the hotel and up some stairs. There is signage along the way but it was kind of far from the hotel entrance.

This was a popular bar and note that we did wait (for a group of 7). You have to queue up and it seems to be first in, first out. Once you are inside, it'll be a air conditioned room with peanut shells all over the floor. There are a lot of small interior design flair, such as the moving sails at the roof. The seating is very comfortable and you will have your own huge bag of peanuts to share.

The indoor aesthetics of the newly remodeled space have a polished feel yet still retain the feeling of the classic period of Singapore history that made this place iconic.

We found the drinks to be tasty and the free peanuts to be a nice treat. Although other reviews suggested that the drinks here are expensive, I'm not sure what those reviewers expected to find in a 5 star hotel -- we came from San Francisco where cocktails are generally in the same price range and are often lower quality.

One highlight was Ting, our waitress, and Suren, our bartender, both of whom were fantastic resources for us, sharing their favorite locations in Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand. Their recommendations enhanced our honeymoon trip and gave us an appreciation for what the locals find great about this incredible city.

Long Bar,Anne R.,16/10/2019,"Recently renovated and reopened in late 2019.  It's on the second floor of the Raffles Hotel, and you may need to try a few different stairways and elevators before you find the right one to the bar, which makes it a bit of a hidden but historic gem and icon.

There was a small wait of a couple people when we arrived at 4pm on a Wednesday, but we were still seated within 5 minutes, up the winding staircase to a less crowded upper level.

Peanut shells were piled on the floor next to each table as most guests indulged slowly in their high potency and high priced cocktails.  We ordered a Singapore Sling $33sgd  and a mocktail version which was basically fruit punch, for $16sgd.

They did a great job making it feel like a throwback to another time and place, drawing on Malay plantation themes with mechanical fans wafting across the ceiling, but thankfully with modern air conditioning.  It's a place to indulge in the experience, not just the drinks, including getting lost in hotel courtyards and considering whether you might have a few more and book a $900/night room.

(1) The Singapore Sling here is actually not even very good! Tastes like watered down fruit punch (plus plenty of ice)... can't even taste the gin.
(2) It's SUPER expensive. $37 for one Sling drink... minimum of $28 for other cocktails. (To put pricez into perspective... even a pint of cheap lager like Tiger is $24 here!) 
(3) They have other signature cocktails on offer... but they don't even seem to know how to make them! We ordered a ""Sakura Sling"" which supposedly has sake, St. Germain, hibiscus, etc. We tasted none of the above. It just tasted like pur3 lime juice, and slightly fizzy. Sort of like a cosmopolitan (Yet the drink description contains NO citrus at all)
(4) The atmosphere is LAME... it's set in a colonial plantation style building, yet they are playing classic rock over the speakers?? Servers also seem rushed, miserable, unfriendly.

we didn't have too long in singapore, so we wanted to check out all the touristy things.

first of all, 1 original Singapore sling will cost you 25 USD. (this is before tax and service charges)... we got one, and we also got the raffles 1915 gin sling for 20 USD (before service charges and tax).
the prices don't really bother me, since it is at a very nice hotel.
what irked me was the fact they forgot my drink, had to wait like +15 mins since it was so busy....service sucked and there was long line to get in.

Service is fine - not especially attentive. No one came to check on us after we'd finished our first round of drinks. 

Oh, and did I mention that it's ridiculously overpriced. You'll be paying SGD 30+ for a cocktail. 

Sure, it's the original and it's fairly strong even if served in a small glass, and I guess you have the cool vibe of being able to eat the complimentary peanuts and throwing the shells on the floor like they did in the old days, but still, that's a steep price to pay.

Long Bar,Jessica H.,25/3/2017,"As the birthplace of The Singapore Sling, this place is super-touristy and expensive, but worth a visit anyway, just to see it. (Even if you're sitting there feeling kinda tongue-in-cheek like I was because it's just SO touristy.)

Most people come here to try the actual Singapore Sling, but it was way too expensive for my liking, so I just hung out for a bit to check out the atmosphere and because I like historic places.

The whole place is really dark, with dark wood everywhere and dim lighting and a cool curving staircase. At night, you almost feel like you're underground in some creaky old wooden basement bar with those rectangular green lamps like you often see hanging over pool tables. (Oh and yes, the bar itself does live up to its name -- it's long.)

In general, this place exudes a heavy, dark, historic vibe. Unfortunately, it also exudes a vibe of overweight sweaty cashed-up Western tourists avoiding the heat and humidity in the darkest air-conditioned place they can find, which luckily for them is probably listed as one of the highlights of Singapore in whatever crappy guidebook they're using. 

To be fair, the Raffles Hotel complex is pretty cool and worth a quick wander to soak up its historic elegance and charm -- I'd just be hard-pressed to name it as a highlight of Singapore when there are so, so many more awesome places to go to and sights to see in this city. 

It was also very noisy and crowded on a weekday evening (around 8pm). Very hard to hear yourself think because of all the buzz and chatter around you. Of course, some might love that tourist energy and claim it's all part of the fun.

Also on offer are peanuts in their shells, which people take great relish in crushing and dropping on the floor, a la Texas Roadhouse.

So yeah, definitely stop in, have a look, splash out the money for a Sling if you really want to, but just go knowing what to expect. Then have a look at the charming Raffles building itself -- the courtyards are really lovely with lush tropical foliage set against the graceful white building, and at night you can have many of the corridors to yourself for photo ops.

Set in the historic Raffles Hotel, the bar takes you to a bygone era. One where plantations doted the countryside and where world empires colonized the remote spots on the earth. It also doesn't hurt that they encourage you to throw the peanut shells on the floor...but remember, only the peanut shells.

Now, there is a menu of cocktails...but you really should come here for one thing: The original Singapore Sling. There are other versions on the menu of course, but you really should have the original. At about $30SGD, it is a bit pricey, and you are probably not going to want to order a second...or maybe you do?

The bar menu selection is what you probably would come to expect and it is a nice nosh to go with your cocktail. Especially if you want to walk out versus stumbling out.

Long Bar,Nadia K.,31/10/2015,"One of the most touristy things to do in Singapore is go to the Long Bar in the historic Raffles Hotel and have a Singapore Sling.  I had slight reservations about forking over $30 for a cocktail, but it sounded like something we needed to do on our first and most likely last trip to Singapore.

As we sat at the bar, we learned that this year the Singapore Sling turns 100!  The famous cocktail was created in 1915 by bartender Ngiam Tong Boon.  The story goes that at the time women were prohibited to drink alcohol.  Boon got around this by creating a cocktail that resembled fruit juice which made it acceptable to drink.  

There are many varieties of the Singapore Sling.  Being light weights we chose one that was champagne based.  We enjoyed eating the free peanuts and tossing some of the shells on the floor.  FYI, this is the only place in Singapore where ""littering"" is permitted.  :D

We had a great time here and having a Singapore Sling was one of the most fun memories of the trip.",4,nightlife; nightlife,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HXmBiMeCLTosCFYXS6icfA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/G8I_yjuL-t4YEShxLJ60_Q/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UMt8a5jH4umeBEK-Nmxnzw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cz63msCqRpmv9MQD6XwKIw/o.jpg,Inside the Long Bar; The Raffles Hotel is beautiful!; Singapore Sling!; The drink turns 100!

Long Bar,Sharon C.,19/10/2016,"I'm not sure why people seem to want to complain about the price, yes it's expensive for a drink. Alcohol, aside from beer, is expensive in Singapore period. Singapore isn't cheap for much of anything, which anyone can tell you before you even get on your flight. Singapore doesn't manufacture liquor so it's all imported. That being said, I decided to end my first night in Singapore here. It was a lovely just for the experience, which is the reason most people go. Yes, there's a ton of tourists, it's a bar in a famous hotel. Not shocking. But it wasn't at all over crowded and it was cool to meet people(mostly couples) from other places. I loved the huge mechanical fans swaying, the style, reminded me of something out of an old movie.

Long Bar,Jamie W.,2/2/2022,"This review is specifically for the ""Singapore Sling Masterclass"" that is advertised by Long Bar for $116.52 as a 90 minute experience learning about the history and process of the creation of the iconic Singapore Sling Cocktail.
Here is what this 90 minute experience was actually comprised of:

1) 2-3 minutes of a very general and casually told description of the history of the      Singapore Sling (the same story that is written on wall signage throughout      Raffles, except poorly and hastily told).
2) 5-10 minutes maximum of making a Singapore Sling cocktail that:
is lacking any detail or description of the process, gives no consideration or depth of information of ​flavour ​profiles.
3) 1 hour to drink the cocktail you made, probably not well for a first try,
4) A complimentary Singapore Sling Glass,
a complimentary plate of 3 satay sticks

I am no expert in cocktails / mixology - I was fascinated to delve into this precision artform/science, and where better would this be experienced by here at Raffles. I honestly thought that this would be on display. Sadly, no. It was a generic, hasty affair that was only stretched out to 90 minutes because of how long we had to wait for the complimentary satay sticks that is included in the package.
Some truly disappointing examples of the experience were:
1) When I asked if a specific kind of gin was needed, I was told ""yes, it needs gin"". Sooo, I presume any gin will do? I had to look at some recipes      later to find that I needed London Dry Gin.
2) We were given a complimentary ""Recipe Card"" for the secrets of making the perfect Singapore Sling. This card has ingredients, but no measurements included. It's lucky I wrote them down after we finished making our drinks.

(The measurements, btw, are 30ml London Dry Gin, 10ml Dom Benedictine, 10ml of  Cherry Liqueur, 10ml of Dry (Orange?) Curacao, 20ml of pineapple juice, 60ml of lime juice (or are those juices switched around? Dammit, I don't      
 remember), 10ml of Grenadine Syrup and a dash of bitters, garnished with a cherry and a pineapple wedge. Shake violently over ice, double filter and pour over ice again.

3) There was an utter lack of finesse trying to explain how to measure 10ml or 20ml of liquid into a 15ml or 30ml slope-sided jigger.

Overall, you are paying for the ""experience"" as much as the drink you (probably poorly for the first time) made. This experience aspect all felt rushed, bordering on unprofessional and almost impatient to get it done.

Sadly, I do not recommend this experience to anyone, whether novice or expert in cocktails alike. You will leave bemused and disappointed in what your hard earned money gets you in such a well-renowned establishment.",2,nightlife; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage

Got an invitation after buying some spirits for a drink at the Long Bar, thought there was time so why not?

The concept is fantastic - an established brand like Raffles, a functional bar, limited seating. Tucked away upstairs of the main alcohol duty free shop in terminal 3. 

There's some spirits available for tasting, and the invitation will get you one (small) cocktail with various spirits that are on sale.

While sipping on your drink, walk around to look at the displays of Hendrick's gin, Johnnie Walker, Glenfiddich, Absolut vodka (stay away from the new Oaked barrel stuff, it's just plain weird). Go through to the wine and rare whisky room, and feel good about the amount of money you have spent in comparison for what you could've (me: couldn't) spend on these fancy rare bottles.

This place could be more than what it is, they could actually turn it into a functioning bar if they wanted to, and leverage the Raffles brand more.

Having said all that, who would turn down a free cocktail?!

Now, don't get me wrong, this truly is a beautiful bar and will conjure a feelings Hemingway and other notables as soon as you enter the bar.

First, so many tourist frequent The Long Bar that locals rally aren't hanging out here, which, if you're concerned about authentic flavor, you want to be were the locals are. Singapore locals are cool always willing to clue you into the best bar, the best hawker stand, or the best anything.

The Long Bar is an overcrowded, overpriced tourist trap. It tended to be under staffed with staff not having time to look after the patrons.

The drinks arrived 10 minutes later and were sweet and fun. I asked twice for a glass of water, as I'm  extreme lightweight and was told it was coming- it never came . From the time we arrived and got through the shambolic queue we were about 35 minutes and then prompty and quickly ushered out once the drinks were empty.

Long Bar,Teri Y.,12/6/2014,"Long Bar is a place that you visit just because.

Well, because there is so much history attached to it. It's where the Singapore Sling was originally created. Yes, that's right. The Singapore Sling cocktail IS actually created in Singapore. Unlike the ubiquitous so-called ""Singapore Fried Noodles/Rice"" found in Americanized Chinese restaurants in the US that have no roots whatsoever in Singapore.

Long Bar is located on the 2nd flr of the Raffles Hotel. This historic colonial hotel is beautiful especially in the evening, with its facade lit up.

The most visible character of Long Bar is the concept of in-shell peanuts served to guests. You crack open the shell, pop the peanut into your mouth, and throw the shells on the ground. There is also a live Filipino band that performs though the night we were there, it was more of a golden oldie type of band rather than a band who plays their rendition of current hits. I'm not sure if this the usual since I've only been once. Most guests are non-locals and I can understand why. Long Bar feels a little lackluster for those looking for a trendy place. For those with a colonial nostalgia, Long Bar is where you can spend a couple hours at in the evening. The Singapore Sling cocktail is S$27. That's a bit steep but hey, it's the Long Bar.

Singapore isn't cheap for booze to start with and of course you are paying $sing 27 for a sling so that bar bill can rack up quickly.
It is however the experience you go for, its Raffles and wandering through the hotel grounds enroute to the Long Bar is nice. 
Service is patchy in the bar - been 3 times now so sometimes good, other times waiting ages to get served. You also get the sack of peanuts and of course you should be dumping the shells on the floor.

The Singapore Sling itself was quite good for a sweet girly drink. I think the bill was 156 SGD for a total of 6 of them, which comes to around 20 USD per Sling these days.

The music and ambiance was very nice - the music was jazz-pop, and I was fully entertained. I thought it was pretty shocking that you were allowed to throw your peanut shells on the floor - the only place in Singapore where littering is encouraged. Haha. That sorta did make my day.

What I Love: The throwing your peanut shells on the floor bit - that was pretty fun. The music, the ambiance, which is very chill - was nice.

What I Don't Love: Unfortunately, the Singapore Sling - which we went there for - was quite a dud. It was pretty boring. I've had better Singapore Slings elsewhere.

I am going to give a completely honest review of this place. I have been to Singapore before and avoided this spot, but on a day when we had nothing to do and walked right past it we thought what the heck. We are tourists after all, let's see what the fuss is about. 

The inside itself is quaint. Filled with old banker lights and fans that swing side to side. It's bustling at all times of day and night, filled with people from all over the world that have decided they 'must' get their Singapore Sling from Raffles. 

That is where the charm begins and ends. To start, the drinks are priced to take advantage of tourists. A Singapore Sling will cost you $28++ and it's quite frankly, revolting. Let's be honest here, it's a terrible cocktail and they are pumping them out on mass so there is little care going into your drink. 

To add insult, a pint of Tiger will cost you almost the same price. So for one cocktail and one beer, we were stung more than $50 plus tax. 

There is the 'quirk' of it being the only place in town that allows littering, with the floor covered in empty peanut shells. I don't know how or why this is appealing. It's disgusting and your bar stool is likely covered in other people's filth. 

Finally there is the clientele. The ""bucket list"" crowd. Which by the look of the average age, could be just about any day now. Think cruise wear, grey hair. George Costanza's father would not look out of place here. 

So there you have it. If drinking a poorly tasting, overpriced beverage in a pool of peanut shells and seniors sounds like something that floats your boat, then yes, you *must* have a Singapore Sling at Raffles.",2,nightlife; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage
Long Bar,Courtney W.,8/5/2016,"Long Bar,

You have one job. ONE JOB! Sling red pineapple juice to hot and sweaty tourists. You should practically have a production line for these diabetes-inducing drinks. Carton to table in 30 seconds. What I don't expect is to have to flag down a waiter 15 minutes after I order two signature drinks inquiring about their whereabouts. Speaking of waiters, let's talk about the service charge. If I am paying an obligatory 10% extra for service, I expect some service. For example, someone should come to my table at least once and ask something along the lines of, ""How is your overpriced pineapple juice? Would you like to order some food? How about a $40 burger?""

Actually, regardless of the improvements you could make, people will still come. Even if they don't like pineapple juice, they'll come for the sake of being proper tourists. Hell. If I could get away with charging $31 for fruit juice grenadine and people still came to my bar in droves, I wouldn't change a damn thing either.

Long Bar, do you. I ain't mad.",3,nightlife; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage
Long Bar,Alana T.,22/8/2014,"I'd just like to say anyone who says the Singapore Sling is worth the S$30 you pay for it is a frigign liar and attempting to look pretentious because they are okay with paying that much for gin and juice (No Snoop Dogg or Snoop Lion, depends on how old you are). 

Why am I fan of this place? 

1. It's gorgeous! I'm sure it's renovated, but the dark wood and fake original floor tile (I think) provides a relaxed setting. I was expecting it to be pretentious. It was not at all. I mean, it is in the SPECTACULARLY beautiful ICONIC Raffles Hotel. You expect it to be a bit more glam. But, it was perfection. 

2. The Singapore Sling (S$27) was really delicious. It was also expensive. But, I really enjoyed it. I will probably NEVER buy another one from this place though. 

3. It's Cool! I mean, Michael Jackson thought it was a solid enough hotel to rest his head and he's the king of all the musics! Yes, musicS! 

Apparently, going to Singapore and not going to place where the original Singapore Sling was created isn't a good idea. You just must! So, I must'd! I'm glad I did and can say I did. Ultimately, Long Bar is a tourist spot. Go and enjoy it.",3,nightlife; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage
Long Bar,Annie P.,19/9/2012,"This is a must see and do in Singapore!  This is a beautiful bar that has sophisticated elegance, class, history, shiny rich mahogany wood throughout the bar. It's undoubtedly an architectural gem and landmark. It's also the home of the original Singapore Sling. Be prepared to pay for that originality. It was about $25 American dollars before tip!

Long Bar,Joanne G.,20/9/2012,"So the last time I came here, the waitress assumed my 70+ year old father was my boyfriend?   ...umm, yuck.  

I'm not a really a fan of the sugary Singapore Sling, but Long Bar is where they were invented and so that might warrant a visit in itself.  

The bar is gorgeous, just like the historic Raffles Hotel where it's located, the peanut shells strewn all over the floor make for a casual and fun atmosphere, and on the night we visited, the cover band was more than entertaining. 

Kind of a chill spot to hang out with the parents and listen to some music.",3,nightlife; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage
Long Bar,Eric R.,7/1/2013,"I know, I know, when in Rome, right? This is another one of those places that you just HAVE to visit while in Singapore. It was here that the Singapore Sling was invented so the only proper touristy thing to do is cozy up to the bar and order one (that will set you back almost $20 and NO, you may NOT keep the glass!)

It is kind of neat to sit back and soak up the historical, colonial/plantation style decor  of The Raffles Hotel, hailing back to Singapore's exotic, colonial days. I recommend this as a mid-afternoon stop, right when you're drenched with sweat and ready to pass out from heat exhaustion.

Once you've cooled off (but NEVER dried out), downed your drink and tried to contemplate what the fuss is all about, you'll be ready to check ""Singapore Sling"" off your list and move on.",3,nightlife; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage
Long Bar,Stephanie Q.,25/12/2015,"The Long Bar is famous for creating the Singapore Sling. I have tried the Singapore sling in other places such as Singapore Airlines, but I gotta say nowhere does it as good as the Long Bar.
Its not cheap, I think it was $32 buts they do a really good job. There are also other variations such as the summer sling, winter sling etc. 
For such a steep price, you also get to eat peanuts and you can throw the shells on the ground. The Long Room feels like an old British bar which is pretty cool.",5,nightlife; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage
Long Bar,Jennifer K.,6/10/2012,"There was no Yelp in Singapore when I was there back in April (to my knowledge) but I figured it's never too late to Yelp the places I visited when I was there..especially since I was pretty detailed in my blogging about my trip haha.

Anyways, my friend and I were only in Singapore for a few days and this was a place I really wanted to hit up. We checked out Long Bar at Raffles Hotel after a trip around the Night Safari. We caught a cab straight to Raffles Hotel and had quite a bit of an adventure looking for this bar. Let me first say that we were there on a Tuesday night so we weren't exactly sure it would still be open. We were dropped off in front of the main doors of the hotel and didn't see a soul. So we walked around the premise of the hotel. We found a restaurant that with a sign on it saying that Long Bar was closed. We tried asking a worker for directions because the restaurant didn't look anything like what I imagined the bar to look like. The directions weren't very clear so we wandered around a bit. We went up and down the stairs and didn't find the place until we were about to give up. We probably spent 20-30 minutes wandering looking for it. 

By the time we found the place, we were told that they were about to close but they allowed us in when we told them we just wanted a quick drink. They offered a number of different versions of the Singapore Sling. I've never had one before but I figured if I knew where it was invented, I should definitely try it. 

It was very fruity and sweet and I quite enjoyed it. The first thing you will notice when entering the bar however, is that the floor is covered with peanut shells. They had a heaping bowl of peanuts on each table and customers are encouraged to just drop their shells on the floor. That was definitely unlike anywhere I've been in the past.

I wish I could have found the place earlier and on the weekend because I wouldn't mind chilling their a bit longer. 

So to summarize (if you don't want to read my all that): I liked the place. The peanut-floored atmosphere was super cool. The drinks were good.

BUTTTT: it was hard to find (for us at least -__-) and it was very pricey. Our total (of just two drinks) came out to $30 including tip. Definitely was one of my most expensive drinks.

Long Bar,Jenn E.,3/12/2015,"Like other Yelpers, I felt very compelled to come and have a Singapore Sling at the home of the drink at the hotel!  It was very, very crowded but we were able to snag a couch area in the middle of the bar where we happily sank into comfy couches to relax our feet and indulge in a classic drink.  The bar looks like it could be from an older movie set and with the peanut shells everywhere it does have a certain appeal and air of an older time.

Yes it's expensive but the reality is that all of the cocktail bars we went to in Singapore were expensive, so, it's probably on average about $5-$10 more than the other cocktails I had on my trip.  I got the classic SIngapore Sling which was fruity, topped off with a generous pineapple chunk and frothy from shaking.  It wasn't very strong, sadly, but maybe it's one of those drinks that sneaks up on you over time.

I'd say come here once for a drink and the novelty if you're in the area!  Enjoy the atmosphere, eat a lot of peanuts and leisurely sip your drink.",3,nightlife; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage
Long Bar,Mike L.,8/1/2019,"Ambiance very nice. Reminiscent of old British colonial architecture. Unfortunately, the hotel was undergoing renovations so I could not appreciate that. The bartender was definitely overworked, but maintained a great attitude and professionalism and was very friendly. I had two Singapore Slings since this is where they originated from in 1915. The drinks themselves were very good. Be careful though, expect sticker shock. I paid $75 Singapore dollars for two drinks which translates to between 55 and 60 US dollars. I think for a one-time experience that is fine but I would definitely not go there again and only because of the price. Everything else was worth it.",3,nightlife; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage
Long Bar,A M.,29/9/2019,"When in Singapore....

We wanted to accomplish two things with our visit to Long Bar. 

1. We wanted to see Raffles Hotel. 
2. We HAD to try the original Singapore Sling.

The hotel was named after British statesman Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, the founder of Singapore. The hotel has just had major renovations and the grounds are absolutely stunning. The Long Bar also doesn't disappoint. 
There was a small queue to be seated at noon on a Monday. We were seated with a bag of peanuts and two menus. The waiter came took our order for Singapore Slings promptly. The original Singapore sling will cost you 25 USD. (this is before tax and service charges). However, this is the original and well worth it. The recipe seems to be a mystery. I think each place in Singapore where I ordered a Singapore Sling tasted differently. It is now great to have the original and have a baseline. I thought it was great. Not too sweet and a perfect mid afternoon cocktail.
If you want to eat anything with this, you won't be able to as they only have a cocktail menu.
Overall, you should come here at least once if you are in Singapore.

PRO-TIP: If you have a peanut allergy, do not come here. There is a bag of peanuts on every table and shells all over the floors.",4,nightlife; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage
Long Bar,Will S.,22/11/2015,Hmm. How to describe this place ? Cruise ship bar. Dave and busters. Retirement home for old western folk. More tacky than charming.

Long Bar,Michelle M.,3/5/2014,"Yes, it is a tourist destination, but if originality is important to you, then you gotta do what you gotta do! However, if you have a really bad peanut allergy, you should avoid at all costs, as there will be peanut shells EVERYWHERE.

Located on the second floor in the corner of the Raffles Hotel, walking into Long Bar makes you feel like you're taking a trip back in time to the British colonial era. I love the Asian-style fans that that they hang from the ceiling. According to my cousin, this is probably the only place in Singapore where you're allowed to litter, so enjoy cracking those peanuts and knocking those shells on the floor!

Personally, I like the Singapore Sling- I find it fruity and refreshing. It doesn't taste too strong alcohol-wise, and I don't get much of a buzz after one. I can't remember the exact price, but it was between $25-30. Pricey, but hey, when in Singapore, right? I will admit that I've never tried the sling at another bar, so if there's a spot on that island that serves a better version, I'd be willing to give it a try!

If you're not going to try the Singapore Sling, I recommend just sticking with wine, beer, or hard liquor. I tried another cocktail a while back (it was the Philippine answer to the Singapore Sling) but it was nothing to Yelp about.

I wouldn't worry too much about dress code, as every one seems relaxed (after all, there's peanut shells in the crevices of the couches and chairs) but if you want to err on the side of caution, smart casual's the way to go.",3,nightlife; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage
Long Bar,Wanida K.,15/3/2016,"I brought some friends over to try the Singapore Sling where it was created and it is indeed the best I have tasted. It's also the most expensive at $31. I think I was the only Singaporean there when I visited. 

The ambience is perfect for tourists, bringing to mind old style colonial Singapore. Peanuts are free flow and it's one of the rare places where you can flick the peanut shells on the floor without repercussions. There's a live band that plays at night on the upper floor. 

There may be a queue in the early evenings on weekends so be prepared. No reservations are accepted.",4,nightlife; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage

But I like the drink and wow the peanuts were amazing never had peanuts that tasted so good before.  The drink itself was good, overpriced but worth a try if it's in your budget.  The bar had this great old time feel to it, really enjoyed the ambiance.  We got lucky and walked right it but at times there were very long lines and service could have been better we were ready to go but our server was nowhere to be found to collect our check and pay so that someone else could have our seat.

When I turned 18 in the States, I knew when I came back to visit Singapore, I wanted to order a Singapore Sling from Long Bar in the middle of the afternoon. I remember ordering two of these (ok... more than 10 years later.. I am still a lightweight) and being happy drunk in the middle of the day with a face that said ""Asian glow"" to the taxi line at Raffles City Shopping Center and practically passing out in the cab! hahaha... good times. 

I took a friend to here last week to enjoy a Singapore Sling - I ordered a virgin sling (because I'm lame and didn't feel like drinking that night due to the fact I had to work the next day) and she ordered the regular. They messed up the order and brought two regular slings. Yea, I could taste that one was stronger than the other... I sipped a bit of the drink and then had to call the waiter over. They charged us for two regular slings. The took away the sling and replaced it with a virgin version and didn't charge us for the sling or the virgin version. That was really nice of them to do that. 

The ambiance in The Long Bar takes you back to a different colonial past but the AC really is freakin' cold! The live band was lively and people were dancing in front of them which was really cute. Not a mosh pit or a club type atmosphere so the total classy factor of this place is perfect. It was a weekday so the place had tables of tourists and older expats. 

I'm a big fan of Raffles Hotel and its one of my favorite places in Singapore to take tourists because its that British colonial old-world luxurious charm about the whole place and they have the best souvenir store selling the classiest gifts too.",3,nightlife; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage

What you'll see? Douchey old guys in Tommy Bahama and trophy wives for days. So you'll feel like you've been transported to a whole other world: South Orange County. (Which was fine with me, I felt right at home.)

And, folks, Chye Seng Huat Hardware KNOWS their coffee. They KNOW KNOW KNOW--if you know, know what I mean. 

My gf and I stopped by after brunch and tried their signature blend, Treva Link (I believe?). It was fantastic to the very last drop! I generally don't finish my coffee at artisan places, but my pretty coffee cup was licked dry! The tables and bars are kind of small so I don't recommend ordering a proper meal. There was barely enough space to hold our two small espressos cups so I can't imagine two full plates on top of that. This place is definitely more of a coffee haven to chit chat so no book worms, please!  

The crowd does seem to be the hipster type. A trend I seeing bursting along Jalan Basar and Tiong Bahru. But hey! Who doesn't love the Brooklyn, Filmore, or Art District kind of vibe?

Chye Seng Huat Hardware,Melissa H.,15/7/2013,"Tucked away in the most unlikely place in Singapore, Chye Seng Huat Hardware does not sound or look like it would be a ""hip"" hangout place from the outside. Once you step inside though, you're greeted with a nice little cafe with cozy decor and chill music. Yep - a speakeasy-ish coffeehouse. who would've thought?

We arrived 45 minutes after noon and the place was packed. We couldn't get a seat inside (which is very limited) and had to settle for an outside seat. It wasn't ideal after walking in the sweltering sun, but after sipping on the cold brew it was quite comfortable. If you come here around 2pm be prepared to wait for a seat. Some people were definitely eyeing our table as we were finishing our brunch.

Cold Brew Coffee $7 - I would really like to try their hot coffee, but for reasons stated above I would be absolutely crazy not to go for the cold brew. I'm not a coffee connoisseur by any means, but this was really good quality coffee. I loved that it came in a cute medicine bottle and ""deconstructed"" form so you can mix it up to your desired sweetness!

Scrambled Eggs $11 - It's a small portion for me, but I'm a big eater. Price is very reasonable in relative to other brunchy places / cafe in Singapore.

Raspberry Financier - My friend got this to share. I have no idea how to pronounce the name of this cake, but it was good and not overly sweet

If you like PPP, you will definitely love this place featuring a Coffee Bar, Coffee Retail, The Roastery, The Workshop and The Annex. The roastery and coffee bar is exactly what it means, the annex is where the tasting happens (call and reserve in advance! 23 bucks!) and the coffee retail is where they display the coffee gadgets and add ons some of which are really interesting. 

Jalan Besar is definitely not the easiest place to get to but I went there twice without driving. so its not impossible lol. Don't be fooled by the front of the store, it may look closed due to the shutter grills but the ""main entrance"" is actually on the side, just like how PPP's entrance was behind. Pretty cool concept and it definitely fits well into the entire row of shophouses in the area. 

Check out the menu too. its really simple.. espresso + milk, espresso + water and brewed coffee. no coffee jargon involved. with a really interesting drink that I didn't get a chance to try.. the beer (& coffee) moment where the description was something like Jungle Beer x Papa Palheta if I am not wrong. maybe someone who has tried that can let me know if its awesome :p

We popped by CSHH (I have so much problem trying to remember the name!) for lunch and the food there is so-so, nothing particularly outstanding and must-have - it's a coffee joint after all so food isn't quite the key thing here and it shows. The omelette was a tad small, the beef patty's a little lacking in taste for me (though presented beautifully with 3 different condiments), but the salami sandwich was ok.

The really unusual thing they have here is Coffee Ale - a special collaboration of Papa Pahelta beans with local brewery Jungle Beer. Owner Leon who was in store that day took time out to explain the brewing process quite thoroughly - this is a guy who knows his beans and beer! It was a really unusual brew with a pleasant (not overwhelming) coffee smell and aftertaste, yet still refreshing as a cold beer is.

The staff here are friendly and amiable, the environment is cozy and organic, definitely an upcoming hipster hang-out and a nice place to chill out (hopefully it doesn't get too crowded!).

The food is surprisingly fantastic despite the rather limited menu. Each item is carefully crafted. The platter saw a fresh mix of pork rillette, duck terrain, salami and Parma ham. The smoked salmon sandwich was also delightful.

While it's exterior retains the traditional look of a usual shophouse, complete with chinese characters on its walls and metal bars at its windows, the interior is an interesting spin on the modern day cafe and bar. 

I had their pistachio cranberry cake as well as their raspberry fingers. For $4 for 2 slices of their cakes, it is one of the most value-for-money ones around. It was pretty nice too, albeit being a tad bit too sweet. I had a regular flat white, as well as a cold brew. While the flat white did not impress, the cold brew had an interesting acidic and slightly fruity undertone. It was a nice refreshing drink that is great to have on a hot day. 

They also have The Annex, which is reserved for exclusive tasting sessions involving coffee and light bites at $23 per pax.",4,food,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7o4m-G8O6BieBQee06FbKw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/M9TJLb9T0OnkcOD10i_Ntw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YDdLLO2jKt2Wcag1Q9SUQQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6h2SfywE0OnhFFNbdW7YPw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lJM3TcB62M-q167RBnoqHQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/v9k7dZFdfJ9kA2JASPiP8Q/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gxVqbDZGSLOGB-Ui3CDZLw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Q7Shk3tAhBPF2BP83UZEIA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/batx-E5H3jp4dINGIyKKPg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ot8juKkdeynEWx9wd0GIdA/o.jpg,cold brew. it is a must-try!,Food & Beverage

Chye Seng Huat Hardware,Paco G.,5/4/2016,"It's interesting to witness what's going on at Jalan Besar and its vicinity. The neighbourhood is slowly changing hardware stores and workshops for cool hostels, galleries and coffee shops. Chye Seng Huat Hardware Coffee is the perfect example of this process. The building used to house hardware companies. Now it is a coffee bar, gallery and roastery. It is so hip it makes me feel like I'm back on Mexico City's ultra-hipster neighbourhoods. It has a very cool atmosphere, complete with a turntable for vinyls (actually they just plug a tablet into it, but I'd like to think it works), industrial-style benches, free lo-fi newspapers, and a colourful, friendly staff.

At the coffee bar they sell amazing coffee. The cold brews are very good, served in cute medicine bottles. They even have cold brewed coffee on tap, which is fresh and tasty. I also tried an earl grey cheese cake which was superb. Prices are -not surprisingly -higher than on any average kopitiam, but lower than most of those corporate coffee-shops we all know so well.

Some people admit it, most of us don't, but we all have a tiny little hipster deep inside us. And that tiny little hipster loves this kind of coffee bars. So, why not embrace the hip and treat ourselves with high-quality coffee?

Here they have a very nice cafe part as well as a roasting and tasting annex and some outdoor seating.

The coffee is good without being spectacular but the presentation of the filter coffee is very nice when they serve in cute little bottles. The espresso based coffees are also good and the cakes and pastries are too good to not eat one or two (or occasionally even more). The food is standard cafe fare and I have been rather underwhelmed by the quality so would come here for the coffee, the cakes and nice setting.

Coffee ale - interesting. It reminds me of a light stout, but not something I'd crave.

Banana cake - probably the best thing here for me. Moist and banana-y.

Good to go if I am in the neighborhood but not enough to make it a destination. It's so popular these days that it is virtually impossible to get a spot indoors.

Chye Seng Huat Hardware,Mouette G.,15/1/2017,"Reviewing the evening bar, not the coffee (I'm sure Papa Palheta deserves their reputation but I'm firmly in the Nylon camp). 

The beers were expensive as expected, and nothing special. My amber ale tasted like Tiger with food colouring. The special was a low alcohol lager infused with mandarin peel and tasted just like it sounded, but it was, to be fair, $8 a pint. There were only 4 choices and I wanted none of them. I suspect there were bottled beers on offer (one of the staff was sipping some) but without a menu or any kind of visibility it would be hard to order them. 

Just down the road are Char and 1925, the former serves Hobgoblin and the latter has decent home brews, better options if beer is what you're after.

The DJ's volume was too high so the evening ended in sore throats. It's strange because there is no dance floor nor dancing. At around 10pm the DJ changed and the sound was pushed even higher. At this point we were screaming at each other, gave up after 5 minutes and moved on. 

The place seems to be a LBGT cruising spot and at least a third of the audience was visibly LBGT, as well as many on the staff. 

The food looked like normal pub food. Fries, mac n cheese, etc. I'd rather eat at the numerous hawkers (in fact that's what we did).

Young and hipster crowd mostly, many fashionable ang mohs. Loads of selfies and Instagram.

Chye Seng Huat Hardware,Chubby Botak Koala H.,11/6/2013,"Chye Seng Huat Hardware - Top 3 Cuppa in Singapore


Chye Seng Huat Hardware ('CSHH') is the second outpost of Papa Palheta which located in the new headquarters for Papa Palheta. Instead of going the boutique way, such as in Bukit Timah establishment, CSHH is a full fledge café serving Coffee, Coffee flavoured beer, food and desserts. At the back of the café, you can see their workshop roasting machines. Beside the workshop is the Annex, this is where you can buy coffee beans and other coffee apparatus. The coffee school and gift shop can be located on the second floor. 

This time around, I decided to pop by for a quick shot of caffeine and a quick bite before my next appointment in Novena. 

The coffee here can be considered as one of the best roasted coffee beans in Singapore. Just check with the crowds flocking this place every day. With the third wave coffee movement hitting its stride in Singapore, you can be sure that you will get a good cuppa just by judging the Rosetta latte art in your coffee. If it does not have one or the rosetta does not look good, you better lower your expectations. 

Most of the time, CSHH will be using their own blend of coffee bean which is known as Terra Firma for their milk base coffee, such as cappuccino, latte, other variety. Their coffee is smooth, dark with a slight chocolate flavour at the end. The best part, is that you will not need to add sugar into it.

For food, this is the first time around I have a grub here. Ordered The BLT sandwich, and it does not disappoint. The bacon and bread is nice and crispy. The tomato and lettuce inside the sandwich is fresh. They serve the sandwich with chips and mesclun salad with Italian dressing. 

Overall, the quality of the coffee here is excellent. The top 3 best coffee in Singapore in my opinion. Don't forget to check out The Annex for coffee beans and coffee apparatus.  Cheers!!

Chye Seng Huat Hardware,Alexander L.,26/12/2013,"OK, as far as the roast quality and barista-ship goes, I'm a fan of Papa Palheta. I think the coffee here is probably the best in Singapore. That's where it ends for Chye Seng Huat however. I get that it's trendy & cool, with the pseudo-industrial layout and the name that harks back to Singapore's roots. I'm down with all that. But the place on weekends is a madhouse. 

No table service means long queues to order coffee. I've sometimes had to wait 15 minutes in queue just to get an order in. Hell if they were serving $1 kopitiam stuff I'd probably be fine with that but considering the prices here, a bit of table service wouldn't be too much to ask. But if people are willing to queue then table service would probably be bad business.

Similarly, I assume, comfortable seating with ample space would be bad business. Why give people space & comfort when you can pack them in & contort them like sardines? Turn those covers! Good business, Papa. Good business.

Related side-note: I once saw two rather portly gentlemen and one very large lady try to squeeze themselves onto their bar-stools. It was... uncomfortable to watch. I actually had to look away.

I'm also not a huge fan of the food, which is 90% misses with very few hits. I frequent this joint reasonably often as it's near where I live. On my last visit I ordered a benedict. The eggs were overcooked and the ham... my God the ham. It was that radioactive pink colour. I'm not even sure that it was technically ""ham"". Well maybe technically but it sure didn't taste like it.

Chye Seng Huat Hardware,Marcus L.,21/9/2012,"Disclaimer time: I have to admit my review is a little biased - I used to work with these guys, and I'm ever so proud of what they've done.

Chye Seng Huat Hardware, or CSHH, (or Ah Huat, if you will) is really the evolution of the Papa Palheta coffee journey, which began just over three years ago (three years and two days, as of this review).

This place is in a word - cool. You can come here for three things:
1. A coffee.
Beans are roasted by the team in their other locations, but operations will be centralised to the Workshop (in the adjacent building in the near future). 
Your beverage is made before you, in the island bar, and you can see the baristas in action, no matter if it's an espresso-based coffee, or one of the many other filter brews.

2. On quieter days, a conversation.
Talk to the baristas - the island bar is built for interaction, and ask them why the do things a particular way. Like why your filter coffee has water poured in a particular fashion, and the importance of the right temperature.

3. A taste experience.
If you're a little more keen, call ahead to book a session at the Annex. You can geek out with a few of your friends over the intricacies of flavour in each small-batch-roasted origin, and even get some off-the-menu treats as flavour pairings.

If you're mega-geeking it out, there's number 4. An education.
They do barista training upstairs as well, so if you've wanted to get behind the coffee counter, here's where you can start.

As a barista, I can't think of many other places I would want to be/work at. and If you're as much of a coffee geek as me, you'll feel the same way.",5,food,,,Food & Beverage

Chye Seng Huat Hardware,Joey C.,13/10/2012,"The good: Fantastic space, very friendly staff (smiles and was asked if my coffee was good) considering it was packed. The crumble cake was decent and the coffee I drank was surprisingly tasty. I'm not a huge coffee fan but when I do, it's full of sugar. This one (bright brew) I drank straight up and loved it. Cudos. 

The bad: Selection lacks. From food to drink options, I struggled to find anything I really wanted to order. Mentally I was prepared for breakfast, which they didn't have. Another huge bummer, no soy. It's Asia, almost 40% (could be way off, but it's high) of people are lactose intolerant. Need a non dairy option stat!  Another thing was the music, I was only there for 25 minutes and heard the same song twice.  Saw a record player playing spinning, but it seems it's there for show and not to actually play music.  If I'm wrong, mix up the records, if I'm not, plug it in and let people play the records they want to hear. Turntables are not meant to be props.    

The ugly: Couldn't fit my finger in the cup handle, how am I suppose to drink?! Almost dropped it a few times while sipping, which would have been extra embarrassing since it seemed everyone there is there to stare at each other.",2,food,,,Food & Beverage
Chye Seng Huat Hardware,Ronan M.,18/3/2013,"CSHH is the new flagship venue of the Papa Palheta group. Located on Tyrwhitt Road (beside Jalan Besar stadium), CSHH is a roastery, retail space and coffee academy. The Steeping Room - previously a pop up space at Bras Basah - makes a welcome return in the form of the Annexe, a dedicated area for coffee and food pairing.  

Papa Palheta cafes tend to have a very distinct decor, feel and atmosphere - CSHH is no exception. The original shell of the hardware store is intact, with art deco lettering and exposed light fixtures enhancing the effect. The interior is bright, airy and contemporary - a new lease of life for one of the old workshops that was here before. Combined with a large retail space, this is not unlike Barista Jam in Sheung Wan, Hong Kong - a venue I like a lot.  

As always, I started by ordering an Espresso. The blend used was a combination of 
Brazilian Coromandel, Guatamelan Antigua and Ethiopian Sidamo. In general, Brazilian and Guatamelean coffees have hints of chocolate, and low acidity, while Ethiopian sidamo has a smooth aftertaste. The shot had an intense aroma, with a dark brown crema, indicitave of freshly roasted beans. There was a syrupy mouthfeel that I typically notice in shots from third wave outlets - this is an indicator that the shot has been extracted for the correct amount of time. The intensity and robust body of the shot was evident from the first tasting - the combination of dark chocolate paired with a citrus, floral notes gives rise to a complex, long lasting bouquet with perfect balance. The aftertaste lingers, and I could taste it long after I had finished my shot. Some things are simply better in their places of origin - like eating chicken rice in Singapore, or drinking Guinness in Dublin, drinking a Papa Palheta blend in CSHH was a coffee experience to savour. There were more notes, flavour and mouthfeel in the last few drops than in any number of shots from other cafes.

I ordered a Cappuccino also. It arrived with beautiful latte art and dark brown foam - a nice contrast of light and darkness. There was a lovely foamy, light texture with an intense coffee hit a few seconds later. The espresso did not dominate in this drink, even though it was a strong shot - the milk and espresso work in conjunction, a 1-2 punch straight to the pallete, where one hits right after the other. They accentuate each other rather than fight for dominance on your taste buds. The layer of foam on top was the correct thickness also - a simple thing, but not something that every cafe gets right.

The retail space is large and well stocked, with Chemex woodneck products, Hario Buono kettles paired with V60 pourover rigs, Aeropress and syphons all on display. There were 5 bean varities available also, which can be bought whole, or ground on request. Professional espresso machines and grinders are available. This is significant - the staff are are baristas who use machines such as these each day, rather than sales people who may receive commission for recommending a particular type.

Some other notable points are the menu, which has a wide variety of brewing types, and clever pairings of food to coffee. Also, I like the pairing of Jungle Beer (brewed in Admiralty) and Papa Palheta coffee - this is entirely consistent with the creative approach of Papa Palheta. I have not yet tried the Annexe, where food, coffee and alcohol pairings are explored more fully, but based on the work that has been done in CSHH to date (and from one or two experiments that are being prepared at present), this is something to look forward to.

In short, it's some of the best coffee that I've had. The original Papa Palheta at Hooper Road may be no more, but the same intense, robust and complex shots live on in a quiet street at Jalan Besar.",5,food,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xMz1TJ5jL9iKCn3q5T6lQQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3tiLAzoICHySe8s7-u36ag/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/td6UqGq9DFUrWwdJtKmbXA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wUfyob1w11lAlr9lM0B3Qw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PKvZnjuT7oXTmcAsWmtcvg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/X9E1PiIaeqClMQzLVe0stg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BrudYKut-X2C6Bea9IogTA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8urzTTLBX78cR811BLTWrw/o.jpg,Cappuccino @ Chye Seng Huat Hardware; Espresso @ Chye Seng Huat Hardware; Single Espresso @ CSHH.

Turns out they are renovating the downstairs cafe so this is more of a pop up store in the meantime. If you don't mind sitting amongst the makers of natures nectar (coffee machines) which I didn't, it was actually a very nice experience to sit and collect my thoughts. 

There wasn't a good selection of food but understandable as they currently don't have a kitchen. 

I'd love to come back in Feb once they have finished the renovations and see what treats are in store. 

In the meantime, it's a great place if you feel like having a coffee and collecting your thoughts - amongst coffee machines.",3,food,,,Food & Beverage
Chye Seng Huat Hardware,Julian C.,13/4/2013,"If you're not a coffee fan (like me) and can't tell the difference between a kopi-o at the local hawker center and the new Starbucks Asian Dolce Latte (I swear by God they taste the same) then don't come here. Because you'll not be able to appreciate the coffee - tried the latte and house brew but couldn't tell the difference between this coffee and others. I think the food here is decent (tried the pancakes and french toast) but there are better places for food if you're really hungry. I can imagine this being a nice chill out place but when I reached on Saturday afternoon is was just super crowded, and packed to the brim. Managed to get seats but I found them squeezy and it was hard to get past the long line of people at the counter.

The one thing I liked was the lemonade though! Tastes exactly like a virgin mojito. Yum :)",3,food,,,Food & Beverage
Chye Seng Huat Hardware,Michael C.,20/5/2014,"Good coffee. I mean really good coffee is actually harder to find in Singapore than you would think given the plethora of coffee shops opening here. Chye Seng Huat's blend is not only good on most days, it can be one of the best in Singapore. We have been tag teaming this establishment and Toby's Estate over in Robertson Quay for sometime and we think Chye Seng Huat may be starting to edge out the Quay's competition including Kith.

Having said that, the reason why they lost out those extra points to score well in my books:

1. Their food is just A-OK. I think the best dish I've had in there is their steak sandwich. Cakes lift their game a little.

2. Floor service is really good for a coffee shop so the fact that they have so many service staff on the floor puzzled me as to why the staff can't take orders. You must go queue at the cashier and order there. Make sense? Not to me. They have a strength but are not entirely using it effectively.

3. Cashier service, as it has become a customer front and interface is actually not that good despite the good floor service. As Chye Seng Huat has pushed the customer experience to us queuing at the cashier, I have to say that the cashier has on a number of occasions not controlled the queue properly by allowing selfish customers who stand right in front of the cashier waiting for their takeaway coffee and hindering attempts from customers behind wanting to place their order so they can sit down again!

4. Chye Seng Huat opens at 9am (its stated very clearly). Yet, on one morning, management apparently decided to hold a staff meeting at 9am that didn't finish until 9:30am. Not only that, they decided not to offer customers standing outside waiting to come in to sit down.

So while the place definitely serves good coffee, we feel that management needs to pick up some common sense and optimise and improve quality of customer service and its hot food menu.

Has POTENTIAL but is not recognising and/or addressing the gaps. I feel their overall rating is a little inflated because I have read reviews here where they point out similar flaws I've found and still rate it as 4 stars?!!! C'mon people. Stop promoting poor service in Singapore please.",3,food,,,Food & Beverage
Chye Seng Huat Hardware,David S.,10/8/2014,I never figured it out...was it a hardware store? or was it built up as such?  quite honestly it doesn't matter.  The coffee here (iced or hot) is some of the best I had in Singapore...but it's a bit far to get to.,4,food,,,Food & Beverage
Chye Seng Huat Hardware,Yiling H.,2/9/2012,"Situated in an old building the decor of the restaurant is quite unique, and although named like a hardware stall it sells anything but hardware. The menu has a whole lot of variety from pancakes, sandwiches, pastries to coffee and French toast.

I really like their French toast and the maple syrup that they serve with it, a real valued for money dish. Their banana cake was really good too as i love the moist texture that it had and the little bits of banana that i could taste inside too.

Featuring an island bar counter for you to watch the baristas at work, this joint promises a lot to come in terms of enjoying coffee. (I'm still reeling in all the information.)

That aside, I dropped by early today for breakfast. Had the cold brew which was served in a medicine bottle-like jar. Very symbolic for how potent it is. I like it watered down slightly by the ice. Also had their breakfast in a cup which was a mix of tomatoes, herbs and eggs baked in a ramekin. Interesting concept which can do with more shaking up.

Chye Seng Huat Hardware,Bryan Y.,2/9/2012,"Chye Seng Huat is a welcome addition to the cafe scene, in my opinon. With the recent cafe craze and mass genesis of indie/third wave cafes, CSHH really is a standout for a number of reasons.

The space is really interesting. It looks like like a hardware store shophouse that isn't in use from the front. But if you walk in through the metal gate next to the shophouse shutter doors, then you're greeted with a hive of activity and a large courtyard area. 

The most interesting feature for me is the roastery. CSHH is owned by the people behind Loysel's Toy and Papa Pahleta's and I hear the coffee beans used at all three establishments are roasted at CSHH. 

The cafe area also has a unique layout/configuration, with a bar style coffee making area in the centre of the room. There are seats around the bar.

The coffee itself is also really good. I like the new cold brew, though my latte was a little flat when I visited.",4,food,,,Food & Beverage

However, the lacklustre mains really let this place down. The food tasted and looked like cold fast food. I had pancakes with sour cream and smoked salmon, topped with beansprouts. It looked and tasted like it was hastily put together. The chicken wrap and banana cake were better and more enjoyable.
Having said that, the coffee is, like what the other reviewers have said, quite good. And I would pop by here for a cup if I am ever in the area. But I would hesitate to recommend it to people who want to come all the way down to have a meal.",3,food,,,Food & Beverage

And the hipster invasion has already begun. Judging from our first visit there, conveniently located near my girlfriend's workplace, we stopped by after lunch expecting some peace and quiet before she went back to work, but we had no such luck.

This is coffee roasting at its finest complete with a coffee bar to enjoy your favorite brew and some delicious homemade snacks as well. I had a flat white perfectly blended with some curry puffs. Both were delicious and the price is on par with other coffee shops in Singapore except this one was top notch. Don't expect a place like this to ever be empty-if you want a seat you'll be waiting and or jumping in front of someone to take it, but the ambiance is cool, the music was nice and it was a  great place to hangout. I ended up buying some beans here from their own blend-again the prices being very reasonable (10-18 SGD a bag) against the USA and other Singapore coffee shops. I must say the area throws you off a bit. It appears to be in a residential area with hardware stores around but the area is for sure in the process of changing.

Let me start by saying there are barely any places to get coffee in the vicinity of my hotel so my gf and I walked a few blocks to 20F coffeehouse which was closed due to renovation. A guy who worked there recommended CSHH after I asked him if there was anywhere else to get coffee in the area. Although the menu prices were shocking, by the time we finally got to CSHH we were too hungry and in need of coffee to find yet another place to have breakfast. Needless to say it cost $48 for two of us to have a mediocre breakfast in a super busy cafe with no wifi (it's also confusingly half order-and-get-your-own-stuff and half waitress run...

To add insult to injury, they put bread under the calamari to make the already tiny dish look bigger. Who does that? 

The portion of the pasta marechiara was big, but that's about it. The ""sauce"" was not what I call a sauce, it's super watery and didn't taste of anything much despite the amount of garlic they put in it. The chopped seafood was the same - tasteless.

Service: 7
Decor: 5
Value: 6
Overall: 6

Been here a few times and really wanted to like the place due to its history. unfortunately, it does not live up to the hype and felt like a run of the mill seafood joint. For this review, I will simply focus on the meal I had this past weekend, which was a similar feeling I had experienced in previous visits.

First of all, we walked in hoping to get some fried soft shell crabs while they are in season, which were prominently displayed on their specials menu. Sadly they sold out of them the day prior. Then we asked for steamers, but they didn't have that either. We were quite disappointed. Regardless, we march on since there is a bevy of seafood to choose from. Here is a list of what we had.

Top Neck Clams (9/10) - Maybe some of the best clams I have ever had. Fresh, plump, clean, sweet, and utterly delicious. So good in fact, we got a second order.

Little Neck Clams (6/10) - These weren't bad, but definitely not as plump or sweet as the Top Neck Clams. Clearly a briny taste, and had sand in few of them.

Blue Point Oysters (6/10) - Never been a fan of Blue Point Oysters, probably because they are so bland. Honestly, these were well shucked and extremely clean, good meaty size and fresh for sure, but flavorless as expected.

Spicy Crab Corn Chowder (3/10) - Literally no crab flavor at all, just a thick, creamy, and spicy corn chowder that I can easily make better at home. One of the saddest dishes.

Fried Scallop Sandwich (6/10) - The scallops were over-fried a bit and not as juicy or tender as they should be. The batter was also a tad thick. With that said, it was decent without the bread, which was just a toasted hamburger bun.

Shrimp Randazzo (4/10) - Looks can be deceiving. Everyone else was ordering it, so we did too. Unfortunately, the watery sauce had barely any flavor. Pasta is simply from a box. The shrimps were fine, mussels were okay, but the clams were grossly overcooked.

Our server was very sweet and friendly, though sometimes it was hard to get her attention when she was on her phone. The space is old school clam bar, but prices were not cheap. I would absolutely swing back for some of those unbelievably great Top Neck Clams, but unlikely to stay for a full meal in the future.",3,restaurants; nightlife; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gEs4dUwb8ijdbiMGQFu-jw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fpXMNGmsUKogbriATN5xgw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SpJQK4NY3knP-q-5-cx7LA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/q-Jyx5ngTcg7nsLM8xePUg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WBgQR-YVZuBA9dd1zoynSg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7-SpyZZd-xtbvYaVKHVgPg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RPSVXPh-hP2X39ZqICs7Ww/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xrGf-JF-z0Ms6N3gibXrhA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sW4NioQXjho1hkHrN69fdw/o.jpg,Blue Point Oysters; Fried Scallops Sandwich; Spicy Crab Corn Chowder; Top Neck Clams; Little Neck Clams; Shrimp Randazzo on Linguine,Food & Beverage

For starters, we asked to move to a different table because we were seated in front  of the door, which when opened,  the wind caused everything on our table to fly off. We were at a table for 4. Across was a table for 6, two of the seats could have easily been moved to our table, but we were told no we couldn't sit there. 
Ok, on to the food. Sub par at best, but at fancy restaurant prices. The baked clams- frozen and all bread crumbs. The oysters were not Blue Point- they were huge and tough. The Little necks were also tough. The Lobster roll-dry and chopped like tuna fish with lots of celery and no flavor- barely any lobster either. 
Muscles served in tomatoey water which they also served the pasta in. The Calamari was so- so. 
Our waitress was fine, but she asked two different girls to bag up our baby's leftovers more than twice and they both ignored her and did something else while we waited more than 10 minutes for the check.

Randazzo's Clam Bar,Honghui Y.,18/8/2024,"Get the fried calamari. It really is the star here. It's served with your choice of ""medium sauce"" or ""hot sauce"" (or both), but that's kind of a misnomer. The ""hot sauce"" is barely spicy and has more of a mild smoky and peppery flavor. The medium sauce is just a sweeter version of marinara sauce. 

I was a little let down by the pasta dishes. We ordered the shrimp fra diavolo with linguine and rigatoni vodka. The pasta itself was cooked well in both dishes. The fra diavolo sauce was fantastic (perfect combo of tangy, sweet and a hint of spicy) but unfortunately the seafood was subpar.

Randazzo's Clam Bar,Bill M.,26/2/2025,"You know the old saying you can't go home again, well I have been out of Brooklyn for close to 30 years. My taste buds were craving some real good calamari with hot sauce. There are some local places  good but not up to the standard set by Randazzo's. The last time I had a hot sauce it was like someone took a jar of Tabasco and microwaved it and called it ""hot sauce"" nah doesn't work. Also the breading overwhelms the delicate nature of the calamari Back to Brooklyn I go. Find a parking space on the same block! That was a miracle. You walk in and its like coming home again. It almost seemed as though the same waitstaff was there! The place is always busy but the people there never forget to be polite and above all welcoming. Once seated the waitress got us menus which definitely were not needed. We placed our order and while we were waiting we were informed of some specials which sounded very yummy but my mission was to dive into a big order of calamari  with the hot sauce on the side. The whole place just had that air of familiarity and warmth. Now if I can only convince them to open a place close to me all would be perfect but there is nothing like the original and only! The food was great the service was in my opinion great as well and my craving for some real good hot sauce, yeah it was worth the trip.

Randazzo's Clam Bar,Reema S.,14/8/2023,"Randazzo's is a South Brooklyn institution in it's own right! Located right opposite to the piers on Emmons Ave, this no frills family restaurant has been a cult favorite forever. 

When you first walk into the restaurant, it is bright and airy, seating is utilitarian and spread apart. It's quite spacious inside, which is nice because it doesn't feel cramped. This restaurant is more on the casual end. 

My friend and I came here after a long day at the beach and Randazzo's was exactly the vibe we were looking for. Our server was sweet and thorough. We started our meal with half a dozen fresh oysters. These were delicious and tastes like the ocean - so good! 

I ordered grilled octopus for a starter. This item is not on the menu, but I wanted to try it as I had seen yelp photos of it beforehand. The octopus was delicious, perfectly tender. I wish that it was a little bit more charred on the outside, though and have a little bit more seasoning. 

For entrées, my friend and I ordered crabcakes sandwich and lobster roll. The crabcakes were delicious, full of crab meat, and not a lot of bread crumbs which I liked. The coleslaw here is mild and creamy, and served as a perfect contrast to the crab cake patty. Lobster roll was good, came on a burger bun. The meat taste of fresh, and the dressing was pretty good with celery and mayonnaise. I do wish we got a little bit more lobster or the meat was chunkier. The zucchini fries that came on the side were banging. If you were dining here, don't forget to order those as they are really really good and super fresh and perfectly fried. 

Overall, I think this place is a solid gem. I would definitely come back here for another seafood centric meal, and it's location by the boats and piers cannot be beat.!",4,restaurants; nightlife; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DL8jSh_pOiKlAY5Qz8a_Kw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ypiT_JzuJQyBG_xMqRinnA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cFCswMmlPTxOvcv_vySrWw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/40yQY40s8O5zitUcYZ9r1Q/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GVeOvInATPK3xUSCVekQzQ/o.jpg,Lobster Roll; Grilled Octopus; Oysters; Fried Zucchini; Crab Cake Sandwich,Food & Beverage

Randazzo's Clam Bar,Matthew S.,14/5/2023,"Randazzo's is not too special, except that it is right on the marina in Sheepshead Bay and has been around long enough to develop a reputation as one of the mainstays in an ever changing strip of Emmons Ave restaurants.

It is essentially Lenny's Clam Bar in Brooklyn, an Italian-seafood joint with plentiful portions and big appetites to feed. The differences are stark, but I am not here to compare the two, this is not Lenny's. 

One of the prides of this restaurant is the Pasta Marechiara, a blend of linguini pasta (the right choice of pasta), in a light sauce with finely chopped shrimp, clams, and calamari. It is tasty and there is enough seafood in the dish to make you wonder if there is any left in the ocean. I will never complain about that.

What I will complain about is everything else. The borderline rude staff (to be fair, today is Mother's Day, so I will try to give them the benefit of the doubt), and the bland tasting options I ate in addition to the above. I had a lobster bisque soup with barely any lobster and found it lacking in any other substance. The fried calamari appetizer had zero taste. In fact, the hot tomato sauce that came with it ruins it because it is too hot.

I understand this is not Maine, other parts of New England, or any seafood town along the Chesapeake Bay, but this seemed rather rushed and thrown in front of me than a sense of love and appreciation for our nautical neighbors.",3,restaurants; nightlife; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FAmLqsqWdJ31b_R9C6lSOw/o.jpg,Pasta Marechiara,Food & Beverage

Randazzo's Clam Bar,Peter D.,21/11/2023,"I've been told my whole life that Randazzo's is an institution. My friends that were born and raised in Sheepshead, or Marine Park, or even you know, the good parts of Brooklyn,* they love it. And they'll always love it. 

And I get it. There's a lot to be said for fried seafood and cold beer after a day out at Coney Island. Especially when it's served by a fun and personable staff that lit up when they saw my kids, and gave them lollipops (a nice gesture even if you don't want your kids eating candy before dinner). 

If I grew up coming here, I'm sure I'd also have the same sentimentality. 

And I do like this place for certain things. Fried shrimp. Fries. Beer. That's what I'll stick to next time around.

Unfortunately, I wanted some baked clams, and with Clam Bar right there in the name, I have to say I was pretty disappointed in these. Small, tasteless, dry. I didn't even want to finish what we ordered, and I never leave food on the plate. I'm also surprised that a place like this is handing out packets of tartar sauce instead of making it in house. This isn't McDonald's. 

It may be an institution, but I don't think it's the same as it was, or it wouldn't have made it.

Randazzo's Clam Bar,Peter D.,10/8/2024,"Let me start by saying I've been going to Randazzo's with my family for close to 50 yrs. This used to be a common place for me to hit all summer through my teens, 20's, and 30's. The food here used to be be phenomenal... World Class.

Left Brooklyn, got married, so obviously I stopped going as often as I used too, but every time I come home we usually go out for Randazzo's . 

The days of perfectly baked clams and fried calamari are gone -
AND THEY AIN'T EVER COMING BACK. 
The Talent in the kitchen has been replaced with god knows who, and the food has been going consistently downhill for around 3 years now.

We ordered Calamari and 2 Dozen baked clams to start, and neither one came out right.
The Calamari had that rubber consistency, which is the same problem I had the LAST time we were in, but the worst offense was the Baked Clams. 
They looked normal when they came out, but underneath the bread crumbs
the clams that were ""supposed"" to be baked, were wet, slimy, and lukewarm.
Yep, these were one click above raw.

The waitress ( who is very nice, and I don't blame her ) knows us, and knew something was wrong when we left 22 of them ( the other 2 had to be spit into napkins... disgusting ) .
She asked the problem and I honestly didn't want to tell her. 
I didn't want to piss anyone off in the kitchen since we had already ordered our entrees and still had ALOT of food coming....
 She said please, let me send it back and they'll make it right.

As a rule of thumb - I DO NOT DO THIS.
She pretty much insisted and assured us that it would be fine, she always remembers us ( she should, she's a great server and we ALWAYS take very Good care of her ), and she wants to take care of this because she knows they're our favorite, etc.etc.  We let her take it back.

Now they come back out at the same time as our entrees. Whatever.
I try one of the baked clams and AGAIN - SAME F**kin THING. 
 
Onto dinner. My linguini was undercooked. 
This guy's got a f**kin problem back there.....
There were 4 of us. 
2 of us said their food tasted "" OK"" ,
Myself and my cousins entrees were downright bad.

Without prompting, the waitress apologized and deducted the baked clams from the bill.
It really didn't matter at that point, I think she could tell. 
Listen, we took really good care of her and said Thanks for Everything and we meant it. This isn't her fault. 
We left.

When we got in the car we had a family discussion about our past few visits   and we all came to the same Sad Conclusion ..... 
The food is either mediocre on a good day now, to inedible on a bad day.
It's basically become an overpriced tourist trap that's living off it's old reputation and location.
We're never going back.

Randazzo's Clam Bar,Glenn C.,9/3/2022,"I was here with a bunch of others in April last year. I know it was a while ago as it was prior to my allergy being severe (as I definitely wouldn't order the oysters/calamari now and probably avoid the conch.) This is an old school place and it was crowded. The service if I recall correctly was fine.

We ordered the following dishes:

Spicy crab/corn chowder
Lobster bisque
Spaghetti with shrimp/lobster sauce
Fried zucchini
Mixed fried seafood platter (filet, shrimp, scallop, oyster)
Mixed seafood appetizer with French fries (scungilli [conch,] mussels, shrimp, calamari)
Fried flounder with baked potato
Lobster rolls with baked potato (and more fried zucchini)

I remember the chowder being excellent. The bisque was good. The spaghetti had good texture but we'd probably just get the fra diavlo sauce instead of the shrimp/lobster. The fried zucchini was good. The mixed seafood/fried seafood was also fine. The fried flounder was easily the weakest thing but  I'd describe this place more for shellfish rather than fish fish. Special note to the particularly good lobster roll. Sure it was pricey but it was the biggest one I have found.  Just odd that it's served on a brioche which made it a bit bready compared to the usual. Still very tasty.

And yes their spicy sauce goes perfect with the seafood. There's a reason why it's famous.",4,restaurants; nightlife; restaurants,,,Food & Beverage
Randazzo's Clam Bar,Amy C.,30/3/2023,"It really is all about the sauce here. More specifically, all about the red sauce. Doesn't matter what you order as long as it comes drenched in red sauce or get the red sauce on the side, and undoubtedly you will walk away with a happy belly. The sauce is deep, bold, and delicious!!! All of the dishes are pretty standard, and what you'd find on most Italian menus. But somehow when the red sauce hits it, it turns from standard to outstanding.

Randazzo's Clam Bar,Sandra Lorena V.,14/11/2021,"This was a spot my partner frequented years ago with his family and he said it looked the same. The layout consists of a few tables and chairs filling the room. Please note they did not check vaccination cards or require masks. There was also no wait on a weekend.

We had a waitress approach us very quickly. She was on a mission through every encounter to ensure there was no dilly daggling. It was nice, but also felt rushed and staff throughout the restaurant would just yell at each other. Quite noisy. 

We had the calamari, lobster bisque, the spicy crab corn chowder, cherry stones and beer. The best was the crab corn chowder. The cherry stones lacked flavor even with the sauce and the calamari was just good. 
I longed for more but was not impressed with what I already had to dare get more.

We had a waitress named Grace. She was all right. We decided to go to steamers, baked clams, and a seafood combo. Everything was perfect. The seafood was fried seafood covered with tomato sauce. Steamers were excellent, juicy, and sweet. After all that, we tried to take some seafood pasta with tomato sauce to go, but the waitress said they couldn't make it that way because they have a different sauce they put on top of the pasta. This is a sauce they pour on top, not cook with it. So we passed on that takeout.

Randazzo's Clam Bar,Manny F.,29/6/2024,"Randazzo's Clam Bar, like the New York Yankees, shows how far a once mighty institution can fall. Bourdain visited this place and Pete Wells still has it on his 100 best restaurants in NYC. If this makes the cut, there may only be 99 edible restaurants in New York. The only good thing about Randazzo's is that when the owners arrived around 7 pm, they were very friendly. 

Like everyone else, we wanted to love Randazzos.

My wife and I got to Randazzo's at 5:50 on Friday evening. We were very excited and were sat immediately. We did not get any water until 6:23. The entire restaurant was full of other hungry tables patiently waiting on their food. Everyone seemed to be waiting an extremely long time for their food. No servers checked in on an us and the place was very well staffed. For a menu of fried food, I am not exactly sure what the extreme delay was. Randazzo's needs a serious management overhaul. 

The calamari arrived and it tasted like standard calamari with a decent hot sauce. Shockingly, the calamari was completely ungarnished. No lemon. No banana pepper. Nary a piece of parsley. 

I had the steamed lobster with a side of fried zucchini. The fried zucchini was pretty good and the steamed lobster was satisfactory. My wife's Lobster Randazzo arrived five minutes prior and my steamed lobster was lukewarm. I imagine it was left sitting for a while.

The pricing added insult to injury: one calamari appetizer, a Lobster Randazzo, and a Steam Lobster came to $140 before tax and tip.

If nothing else Randazzo's is certainly consistent. This was my second trip there and it was just as bad as the first.",1,restaurants; nightlife; restaurants,,,Food & Beverage
Randazzo's Clam Bar,Lisa L.,23/8/2021,"It's one of those local places you come to for a decent meal, not amazing not bad. I was feeling seafood and my friend was treating so had to find a decently affordable place with a ton of options. My friend eats a lot so it needed to be worth his money too. 

The guy at the counter recommended the shrimp fra divola. We ordered the littleneck clams, shrimp fra divola pasta (came with actual clams and shrimp) and a clam linguine (just chopped up clams) pasta. The little necks were good, but 6 for $10 is sorta pricey, but oh well I wanted clams. The pasta dishes took a bit to come but not a ridiculously long time. We also asked for additional plates since we were sharing. I think the shrimp fra divola dish was better than the clam linguine, but my friend preferred the clam linguine. I preferred the shrimp pasta because it was a tad spicy and had more flavor, but my friend thinks the sauce was too salty and overpowered the dish, so he preferred the clam linguine. The clam linguine was a bit plain for me, but not bad. 

Service at the counter was also pretty good.

Randazzo's Clam Bar,Dana A.,9/7/2022,"I hate to give a bad review, especially to such a neighborhood staple, but the food just is so off lately.

My order had mussels in white sauce, calamari, and a lobster bisque. 

The mussels had no flavor and the broth they were in tasted like an oily oregano water and literally nothing else. I had to sprinkle salt on each one I ate. 

The calamari was nice and crispy and not over cooked at all which is great but the breading AND the marinara had absolutely no seasoning at all and once again had to add the salt myself. The waitress also never brought the lemon for the dish even though she kept saying she would.

The lobster bisque had literally no lobster in it at all and tasted like bland heavy cream and boiled potatoes. Again, had to add a good amount of salt and pepper to make it bearable. 

Our waitress was very sweet and I really enjoyed her but waited a long time just for her to bring a soda. Also, at $3 a soda you'd think you'd get a regular can but it's a mini bottle instead so they're definitely price gouging there a bit. 

Overall the takeaway was that the literally do not season any of their food so be prepared to salt and pepper to everything.",2,restaurants; nightlife; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5zdiBvXRrKe9TCKAe_vR5g/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OpueC-6yaNxq04O-9J0ClA/o.jpg,Mussels in white sauce but you can see how it looks like cloudy oily water.

The service was friendly and prompt, but the food was so bad. I ordered a seafood combo and none of the seafood had any salt at all. 
It seemed fresh enough and wasn't overcooked, which is a skill for calamari. The ""biscuit"" was really just a piece of bread that gets hard to eat really fast. The mussels and clam bits were super bland.

For main course I ordered the Lobster Randazzo which brings a whole lobster split in 4, 3 shrimps, 4 clams in a lemon, butter, garlic, and wine sauce. Served with choice of pasta. I ordered Lobster Fra Diavolo which brings a Lobster cut up in 4 pieces, 3 shrimps, 3 clams, 6 mussels in red spicy sauce. The sauce has just the right amount of heat.

I started to explain what happened she completely cut me off told me that she only work there and she would not speak to me about the wrong items asked if I could speak to the manager which then she said she was the manager, I asked her could she call Pauline, she replied no she wasn't going to call anybody. She had a very nasty attitude about the entire situation, proceeded to pull a menu out and say there's no substitutions, I advised her that the order was placed over the phone not on location and asked her why was she being so nasty about the situation and to call Paulie Jr. which she refused then sat down in the chair and starting talking to another guy about her not dealing with the this over a salad. I will never go back to this place ever again as I believe this was racially motivatedI.

Randazzo's Clam Bar,Helen S.,12/7/2024,"This place used to be great but they got cheap. The plates are tiny but besides that, the food is not what it used to be. The lobster roll is not on a roll. Let's just start with that. The lobster filling was tasteless and had a licorice flavor. I would not consider that burger bun with cheap lobster meat a lobster roll under any circumstances. The grilled octopus was rubbery and not edible. Their special salad that we asked for chicken with... made us order another entree instead of just doing a side of grilled chicken. The clam chowder was ok but that was the only thing that tasted good. Been coming here since I was little. But never again. Place was empty too. Obviously not the only one thinking this.",1,restaurants; nightlife; restaurants,,,Food & Beverage

Randazzo's Clam Bar,Meredith R.,24/9/2019,"We had taken my mother -- a New Yorker living in Georgia -- on a 'this is your life' car trip around Brooklyn.  It culminated at Randazzo's, a clam bar that's been around I think longer than me... and I'm old!

I recently saw Randazzo's calamari on a list of 50 Iconic Restaurant Dishes, so ordering a portion was a no-brainer.  One can get either a spicy or medium hot sauce.  We chose medium.  The calamari was crisp and good -- but iconic.....?  That would be a stretch.

We all got clams which we slurped down.  I was happy with the white wine and garlic sauce.  My husband, sampling my mother's, said next time he'll order their richer, red sauce. Red or white,  both were great to sop up bread.

While it's a laid back, bare bones dining room, the place isn't cheap.  And the portions, as you can see in my clam photo, aren't particularly generous.  But Randazzo's is a Sheepshead Bay institution, that continues to attract people from all over.

Randazzo's Clam Bar,Dick G.,10/8/2021,"On a rainy Sunday afternoon we trekked to Brooklyn to visit the highly acclaimed Randazzo's Clam Bar. Situated across the street from the Sheepstead Bay, RCB stands out with bright signage and crowds. We parked in the rear of the building and went inside via the side door. No problem at 3pm seating our party of 4 hungry souls. Our server was vigilint and came right over to begin taking our order. They are famous for their Galamar and we started with 2 orders,Next visit we will get 4 orders.... and two sides of both medium and hot sauce. The Galamar was crisp, not oily, and absolutely delish! Perfection on the plate. The sauces were so good we ended up cleaning 6 small bowls of it...Mmmmm!! Next we got a dozen Cherry Stone Baked Clams. They were whole and covered with a tasteless stuffing...clams delish, stuffing not so much! Next we went with a large bowl of Zuppa de Mussels...Absolutely marvelous! The sauce was go good and garlicky that we mopped it up to the last drop. We still had some room and went with a Linguini with white clam sauce, Shrimp Parm and  Shrimp Fra Diavalo. The best of the 3 shared dishes was the Shrimp Fra Diavolo with the Shrimp Parm 2nd and the oily Linguini in clam sauce 3rd. 
Considering the fun time we had at Randazzo's and the great food we look forward to returning!

1 doz oysters
1 fried calamari 

Calamari- delish. Super duper light batter and still hot from the fryer to our lips. Served with house marinara- yes.

Cherry stones- as plump, clean chewy as id remembered. A bit salty, inherently. 

Oysters- they are fresh and clean tasting but not huge as we'd hoped. Some pieces were flimsy. There was nothing too memorable about this dozen only that they are a premium cost here. $30 per dozen.",4,restaurants; nightlife; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/M6lymUx_YmtTRUG90MAo4A/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/l3TYcq5C5T51cXJFv5-VrA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_xpImpBkSclxE4YwqDrB0A/o.jpg,,Food & Beverage

Randazzo's Clam Bar,Devon O.,26/5/2019,"Came here on a whim after hearing so much about it. Even when I lived in the Bronx my grandma would mention driving down to Brooklyn for this, which speaks to its legacy and demand. That being said, it was destined to be tried. 

We started with a large calamari dish, for me, reminiscent of the late Roccos Calamari(if youre from the bay ridge/dyker heights area). This is soft, tender, incredibly fried calamari with a well complimenting tomato sauce.

Entree wise, my uncle had a lobster roll, one of the biggest I have seen, for a great price point. I have never seen this man unable to finish food, but when we found him picking off bread to maximize lobster, we knew this was the one. Other than that, I had the stuffed shrimp, and honestly it was disappointing. Every other dish came as a great portion size and was very well presented. This was meh. Decent flavor, and then shrimp is shrimp, its always good but so much more could be done with this.

The days winner by far was my wifes seafood fra diavolo that had her pulling out full lobster tails. This is honestly for two people. I literally took half, including all mussels and clams, and not only was she full, but she had some to take home. Well after we crossed the finish line, we were still sliding bread through that delicious sauce.

Greatly appreciated good food and hospitality, now I know where to go when in the sheepshead bay area.",4,restaurants; nightlife; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dadUw1o7O-koynI0o1301w/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QPFX7z94VFAoiJhDJtSVIw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Nb166RFlU1q6JL-_ow06lA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dWRy3evzevYSvziYpoJ55Q/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/z8uTr1f73Lj4-ydzz_yx2w/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/V0OFOEwy8T6BMNTuahRIlA/o.jpg,,Food & Beverage
Randazzo's Clam Bar,M M.,17/10/2023,"Came with a friend. Sat at the counter.  This is about my order.  Lobster bisque + linguini w/white clam sauce.  This should be called lobster puree - there was not one single piece of lobster in the cup.  It had not even a single hint of tasting like lobster.  The linguini was cooked nicely and although it looked to be very tasty, it was extremely dry with a small amount of sauce in the dish.  Portion size was very nice.  There was barely a taste of garlic and though a lot of chopped clams, they had simply no taste.
NO BREAD - I ordered a pasta dish and they served no bread with it.  So I questioned myself.  Went home and visited over 15 websites which clearly indicate Bread Is Serviced with Pasta!  Where's the bread Randazzos?

Cost -  Extremely high.  2 Pasta dishes, one cup of soup, 1 tiny bottle of white wine, 1 can diet coke  $ 118.00 + tip n tax.  We sat at the counter, service was good.",1,restaurants; nightlife; restaurants,,,Food & Beverage
Randazzo's Clam Bar,Catarina A.,25/2/2021,"I've been here many years ago and I quite enjoyed it, however, I went again recently and it was absolutely a disappointment. 

Let's start off with the positive side, the seafood was very fresh! Amazing oysters actually. And my meal was starting very well! It was extremely sweet oysters and adding that sour lemon made an amazing combination.
Then the second plate was the Steam Littleneck Clams. This was absolutely disappointing. It's said to be cooked with white sauce, but all I could taste was watery sauce. It was bland with no taste. The garlic in it did not even help the flavor. And dipping the bread in the sauce was like bread with water. 
Lastly, the pasta wad the same as littleneck clams. I ordered White Clams Sauce Pasta and it was all soggy and no taste. Just like I said, everything was BLAND. 
At this point the food wasn't enough to fill me up but I just couldn't order more because I knew it would all taste the same. Bland. Tasteless.

Now, as for the service, i had 2 waiters. One was very nice lady who took my orders and the other just threw the plates to my table. Moreover I was sitting in a table of 4 and the lady just threw the plates to the other end of the table instead of putting it in my side. I was not mad, but since the US have this system of tipping certain percentage, I would rather tip for a better service.

The reason for 3 stars is only because of the seafood freshness otherwise I would give lower. 
I hope they change back to the good old restaurant that was before. I really liked it before",3,restaurants; nightlife; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pW-vknr0ULH7rF4Jd0Czwg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MTzgBTTcArI33wenshBjHQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4V-4TnedSvvH3ElVBBFg7w/o.jpg,White Clams Sauce Pasta; Oysters; Steamed Littlenecks,Food & Beverage

Randazzo's Clam Bar,A R.,4/12/2023,"Wonderful food, wonderful vibe.  Superb raw cherrystones at a good price, and a terrific, generous bowl of zuppa di mussels in a perfect red sauce that was very flavorful without overwhelming the mussels.  Seafood doesn't need to be loaded up with all kinds of stuff, it needs to be at the forefront and it needs to be fresh and well prepared.  They seem to get that - the food isn't pretentious, it's just great. 

Our waitress was very helpful and nice when we asked roughly 1,000 questions. She, and the restaurant in general, was very laid back and very welcoming.  It's a comfortable place that, unlike so many restaurants now, doesn't blare music or TV, doesn't try to upsell you every 15 seconds, and doesn't mess with classics.

Randazzo's is a no BS red sauce Italian American joint. The seafood was very fresh. We went with combo app (mussels, shrimp, calamari and scungili), steamed calamari and the epic fra diavolo. And of course took a advantage of the homemade spicy red sauce. Slipped a few Peronis in for good measure.

Clam Chowder Soup -- my favorite place to get this. It's not too thick and not overloaded with potatoes. 

We always get the Fried Calamari -- it has a light and crisp coating that's fried perfectly so that its still very tender. What makes it even better is their Special Marinara sauce! Make sure to save some and DIP your bread in it! 

Their Cherry Stone Clams -- always so fresh and meaty! Haven't had these in so long and they definitely hit the spot. 

Mussels -- amazing as always. Their mussels are so juicy and the sauce is the best part. I could literally drink it, and I do. But I recommend also dipping your bread in it. 

The Shrimp Scampi -- tbh it was a little bland; had to sprinkle a lot of Parmesan and even add a little salt to it.

Enjoyed the crisp, lightly breaded fried calamari.  Boyfriend thought the dipping sauce for the calamari wasn't tasty, however, he still enjoyed the calamari.  We were both disappointed with the baked little necks clams after looking forward to them. I'm sad to say the taste reminded me of stale seasoned breading :(.

Was in the area yesterday for a whale watching cruise which ended at 8:30pm. The restaurant was a 3 minute walk from the pier. We opted for outdoor dining. The restaurant has a window where you can order solely for take-out and take-away. Right next to the window is a (confusing) line if you want seating for outdoor dining service. You could tell that the people joining the line were not sure if they were in line for the take-out window or for outdoor dining. It was also a Saturday night, and the whole street of restaurants was busy and surprisingly packed. My boyfriend and I were seated in about 10 minutes. After ordering, the food arrived within 10 minutes.

Customer service: 5/5. Our server and the staff overall(host/hostess, busser, server) were respectful and pleasant to interact with! Even though the restaurant was bustling, the service was prompt. The servers were attentive and quick to bring out napkins, utensils, drinks and our check.
Cleanliness: 3/5. Our table was wiped down before being seated, however, there was tomato sauce splattered on the ground below our table and we had to prop our shoes on to the legs of the table to avoid tomato-soles.

I get that places are struggling and I don't mind the extra cost but it would have been nice to know that at the start. In general, I would come back again!

In terms of the food:
-Lobster rolls: the lobster roll was fresh and was a big portion. It was different than a typical lobster roll as it's served on a brioche roll! I also loved that we were given the options for the sides. I opted for the zucchini fries which were delicious. I would get this again!
-clam chowder: it was delicious and hit the spot. Would recommend!

Can I say those were the freshest clams I think I have ever eaten.  They were so good that I got a 1/2 dozen as well.  The soup was to die for (I ordered a small and regretted not getting a large).  The shrimp parm and spaghetti was delicious as well!  I was sooooo stuffed but very happy when I left.

Let me say that this place isn't cheap, but it's definitely worth the price.  So much so that we're planning on going back there again this weekend!",5,restaurants; nightlife; restaurants,,,Food & Beverage
Randazzo's Clam Bar,Chris E.,16/1/2018,"Just as advertised!

To be honest, prior to my latest visit I never knew Randazzo's was featured on Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations in 2012, and nor did I need it to be featured on that show to know that this institution existed near me. For almost all of my life, I lived near one of the great seafood establishments in Brooklyn, located way too far south for some to ""trek"" to, but very well worth the long train ride.

I had once visited the restaurant a long time ago, way before I knew what good food was, so it only made sense for me to make the pilgrimage back ... and that time was now! I dropped in with my wife on MLK day and the restaurant was fairly quiet compared to the spring and summer nights where I passed by. By the end of the evening when we left at 8pm, the restaurant only had 6-7 parties inside, which we honestly did not mind since it was nice and peaceful.

From the moment we stepped in, till the moment we left, the service was fantastic. ALL, and I cannot stress this enough, ALL of the waiters and waitresses were extremely friendly throughout the evening -- to us and to other parties. The menu was pretty daunting as there were many seafood and Italian dishes to choose from, so we did our research on the more popular dishes way before we walked in. Based on our research, and the flavors our tastebuds love, we went with the following:

New England Clam Chowder (Bowl)
- Hearty and very tasty. There was a fair amount of potatoes and clams inside. Since it was cold outside, the warm chowder really hit the spot. On the bad side, there were a few sandy spots in the chowder, but not enough to really bother us that much.

Baked Clams (Cherry Stones)
- Another winner. Unfortunately, there were only 10 clams in the order because we could have easily just kept on going and going and going. The clams were big and baked really well. The breading used on the clams were very flavorful, especially when the squeezed lemon was sprinkled onto it.

Fried Calamari (with sauce on top)
- This is the dish many come here for and it did not disappoint. The red sauce was so tasty and just right. It wasn't too thick and wasn't too liquidity either. The calamari was easy to chew thru and fried well. The batter on the calamari maybe could have used a little bit more crunch, but the sauce really softened it up quickly, so the crunchiness of them wouldn't last long.

Shrimp Fra Diavolo (On A Bed Of Pasta shrimp, clams & mussels in a red spicy sauce)
- Probably our least favorite dish, but that probably has more to do with our preferences. We decided to order this since we saw so many pictures of it. Unfortunately, the sauce was a bit more watery than we liked and we weren't big fans of the entire dish because it was basically just linguine with red sauce and seafood. With that said, it still wasn't that bad and pretty flavorful. I'm more of a chicken parm pasta dish kind of guy, so this was far from my 1st choice, but we went with it anyway to share.

Overall, we really couldn't complain. The restaurant wasn't crowded on the night we went and the food was good. Like I said earlier, the service was also excellent and the folks working there couldn't be more friendly. Are there a few things they could fix? Sure ... but it wasn't the end of the world and none of the negative things ruined our meal.

Randazzo's Clam Bar,S-Ann O.,15/4/2021,"All Lobster Rolls are NOT the same!
Unfortunately, I paid $67.60 for three food items (lobster bisque / Manhattan clam chowder mix and two ""lobster rolls""  -  one with a baked potato and the other with french fries.  We expected to receive sweet (knuckle / claw / tail) lobster on warm classic buttered ""lobster"" buns.  However, what we received were lobster salad sandwiches, which did not resemble or taste like classic lobster rolls.
Because of my prior Randazzo's seafood experiences, we incorrectly believed their lobster rolls would be a pièce de résistance similar to Maine's lobster rolls.

Randazzo's Clam Bar,Peter S.,5/9/2019,"Small, casual, somewhat cafeteria-looking and utterly iconic.  It's one of those places that's definitively Brooklyn.  I regard this as ""New York City iconic"" as Carnegie Deli or Balthazar.  They were MIA for a year after hurricane Sandy, and I thanked the Gods when they came back.

The food here is A+.  Unlike 90% of all the Italian restaurants in NYC, their sauce isn't sh*t.  This place has great sauce: one taste, and you'll understand why the sell it in take-home jars.

The sauces are great, and the seafood is utterly fresh.  A meal here really hits the spot if you're hankering for shellfish.

I honestly don't understand how this restaurant isn't 5/5 stars by anyone's standards.  The waitresses can be a little cheeky in an old-school Italian kind of way, but that's part of the charm of this iconic clam bar.


Little Necks: A+
Cherry Stones A-
Oysters: A+
Just... perfection.  Fresh, clean tasting, and almost cathartic.  As far as I'm concerned, the best in NYC.  You'll want to load them up with the following (in order):
1. horseradish
2. shrimp cocktail sauce
3. Squeezed lemon juice
4. An oyster cracker for the clams, two oyster crackers for the oyster.
There's a bit too much meat on the cherry stones for my liking: still delicious, but your chew is mostly clam rather than an amalgam of clam with accoutrements.

Shrimp Cocktail: A
Beautiful, humongous, soft, tasty shrimp.  Phenomenal cocktail sauce.  The best.

Lobster Fra Diavolo: A+
I've had an awful lot of Fra Diavolo in my life, and this is one of the best.  The secret?  Their sauce.  It's tremendous!  I'd say medium to light on the heat index.  If you're ok with semi-spicy food, you can order this and let them use their default spice level.  Pro-Tip: They create the sauce from scratch when you order the dish.  If you like sauces, I would order this dish ""with extra, extra sauce"" to make sure you get enough sauce.  Seriously, it's stupid good.

Marinated Burned Chicken: C
Sauce is very good; it tastes like a butter and wine sauce (I was expecting marinara so this was a surprise and I ended up liking it).  However, the chicken was unforgivably dry.  Some pieces were OK, but the majority of it had to be choked down with water.  I'm not sure whether it was overcooked at the outset or simply warmed in a microwave for too long, but either way, this dish is no bueno.  No amount of sauce would've helped this dish.

Stuffed Filet: A+
This is flounder stuffed with crab meat and tiny shrimp.  Nicely charred on the outside, a delicious sauce that can hardly be believed.  The dish is juicy and delicious.  It's as good as my mom used to make it.",5,restaurants; nightlife; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Q9ZTQYa7Iq_E2RocCbp7YQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/e6xwyeBvGXz3fcv7UfIGFg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/v4EMtLtYJtkHRLLIVzxNHQ/o.jpg,The lobster fra diavolo was perfection itself.; Stuffed Filet: A+.

While I should have taken a picture of my dinner last night, I simply didn't feel like it but rest assured there are plenty of pictures already uploaded on here of the dish I got that are very accurate. 

I was seriously craving a stuffed lobster from Lobster House Joes on Staten Island but was not in the mood to travel all the way over there and back so I literally searched all of Ubereats to try and find something similar. I got tired of searching and was going to order something from Anthony's in sheepshead bay but something told me to just type in Stuffed Lobster in the search bar and this place popped up. That's when I came here and saw pics of the dish and decided to go ahead and order, it looked very very similar to Joe's just a tad more expensive. 

I called and asked them if it was possible to switch out the side options for some simple pasta and oil w/ garlic but apparently that wasn't allowed even if I paid extra? Idk I thought that was stupid, I'm paying almost $50 for a plate of lobster, why would I want French fries or fried zucchini? This forced me to get an extra side order of pasta which cost me $11. I was pretty annoyed lol, it was a small aluminum container of spaghetti and marinara, that's it that's all for $11. The lobster arrived in an aluminum tray and could have easily fed 2 people. The stuffing was good but nothing amazing tbh, there were more shrimp and breadcrumbs than anything else, barely any crab or lobster and a slight hint of cheese, so was it better than Joes? No definitely not. BUT, the lobster was good and I still have some stuffing left. I would definitely order again, I just most likely wouldn't get this dish cause it doesn't compare to what I'm used to.

Din Tai Fung,Cindy W.,5/8/2025,"Being Taiwanese American, the much anticipated opening of Din Tai Fung in New York City did not disappoint. I am writing this review after my second visit to provide a more well rounded feedback.

Now that the restaurant has been around for a while, the walk-in experience is a lot more manageable in case a reservation wasn't secured ahead. There are also bar seatings for any small parties.

We have tried a variety of dishes and our favorites consist of pork xiao long bao (budget about 1 serving for two people), spicy wontons, sticky rice shao mai, Taiwanese cabbage, and minced pork noodle.  Though the xiao long bao quality wasn't consistent between both visits where the most recent one felt a bit dry. 

Services were friendly overall, but not timely. We had to remind different servers on getting a lid for the hot tea, which never arrived. It was also a bit confusing on which server would remove the empty plate vs just delivering dishes. The server from our first visit checked on us a few times during the meal while the server from our second visit only came by once to see if we needed to order desserts.

Lastly, we asked for extra ginger during the 2nd visit, but the server never mentioned the extra $3 charge. It is just honest business conduct to share that info so that it is not a surprise.

Din Tai Fung,Mark A.,2/8/2025,"Ok, here's the story.  I am a huge Din Tai Fung fan.  I have been to so many locations around Asia and the other US locations in LA and this was the most expensive and worst experience of all of them I am sad to say.

While it still has many of the charms of the other locations, and even at it's worst performance is still a delicious experience, I was just so excited for a NY DTF experience, and was let down.

We ordered a some cocktails, a couple of xiao long bao dishes (one pork, one chicken), fried rice, cod dumplings and of course dessert.  

The pork xiao long bao was undercooked with the wrapper still chewy, the chicken looked as if it had been dropped because they were all clumped together, so the meal did not start out well.  

From there the dishes did improve and we really enjoyed the cod dumplings (new to us) and of course their famous fried rice - which did not disappoint. 

As for the cocktails, I think this was the highlight of the meal.  We had the sesame espresso martini and the yuzu margarita.  The sesame espresso martini was the best espresso martini I have ever had and the yuzu margarita was also nice and refreshing.

Dessert was really a bit disappointing to us as well.  Having had their chocolate xiao long bao and their sesame dumplings in the past at other locations, these were 10x the sweetness of their Asian locations.  the chocolate xiao long bao was made with a super sweet milk chocolate instead of dark chocolate and their sesame dumplings had so much sugar that we did not finish either dish.

Service was meh - and the ambiance was an upscale homage to the Din Tai Fung mothership.

While I continue to be a Din fan, I don't see myself returning to the NY location any time soon.",3,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/M0mMGMJ_TIH8dgVRRQ25IA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MGFepWbxX9eQRS6ry_xdVw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ro7RuOCr1dgPLT--LESAfQ/o.jpg,Sesame; Chicken Xiao long bao; Best expresso martini,Food & Beverage

Din Tai Fung,Kayla N.,25/7/2025,"The location is great for if you're staying in Times Square as you can quickly walk there but make sure you have a reservation! They do accommodate walk-in parties but for us, it took about 90 minutes to get in (luckily we grabbed a drink nearby during the wait). 

Once they texted that our table was ready, it was a quick check-in process and we were seated not long after. We had 6 in our party and were given a nice round table where it wasn't too loud. 

We all ordered wine or cocktails and each asked the server what he'd suggest based on what we were ordering and he gave thoughtful suggestions. Additionally, we received suggestions on dishes as well. As we were doing family style, we ordered a ton of food from soup dumplings to cucumber salad. 

While some of the food was a bit too spicy for me (as I have 0 spice tolerance), everything was clearly called out on the menu so I knew what I'd be trying and all the food tasted pretty good! 

This was a cool stop during my week in NYC and I'd definitely visit another location again if I saw one while traveling!

Din Tai Fung,Stephanie G.,20/7/2025,"I've been dying to enjoy DTF since trying it the first time a few months ago. The only location in the east coast happens to be right near Broadway. I would definitely make a reservation here. You walk in this glass building and down the stairs is the check in area. We were given a buzzer while our table is getting prepared. A few minutes later and we got called and walked to our table. The place is intimate, classy but no need to dress up or anything. 

Our server was snappy and quick but it rubbed me the wrong way when she took our menus while placing an order. I suppose we should have just written out our order, but totally forgot that was an option. While I've had better XLB, if it's your first time here, then get it just to see what the hype is about. This time around though, we ordered the chicken XLB (there's never enough soup in my opinion but the filling was tasty), pork buns (didn't try but hubby thought it was okay), fried rice with fried pork chop (my personal fave), cucumber salad (don't pass on this) and the chocolate mochi XLB for dessert with the sea salt cream. Shockingly, our meal was around $100 including tip.

Din Tai Fung,Leora S.,25/7/2025,"My friends and I were dreaming about coming here, especially after the NYC location opened and everyone started raving about it. Naturally, we had super high expectations! We started with the famous cucumber salad, but honestly, it was a little underwhelming just tasted like plain cucumbers I could easily make at home.

The garlic string beans, on the other hand, were unexpectedly amazing, super crunchy and addictive. We also got the chicken xiao long bao, which were really juicy and flavorful, though a bit fragile; a couple of them broke from the soup weight, but they still tasted great. The chicken fried noodles were my absolute favorite. I kept going back for more and basically devoured the entire plate myself.

We also tried the spicy chicken wontons. They weren't my personal favorite, but the rest of the table loved them and said they were the standout. The drinks were yummy too. I can't remember exactly which ones we got, but when one of us accidentally spilled hers, the staff rushed over, cleaned it up immediately, and brought her a fresh drink without hesitation.

Our waiter was so pleasant and attentive throughout. For dessert, we got the chocolate mochi xiao long bao, which were unreal. The sea salt cream they came with was so good I was eating it by itself and yes, we ordered extra just for that. It's supposed to come with five pieces, but ours had only four, and our waiter noticed without us saying anything and brought us a whole new tray.

Din Tai Fung,Parita A.,19/7/2025,"Oh man it did not disappoint! The space is absolutely gorgeous. One of the coolest parts is being able to watch the team making dumplings through the glass; such a fun touch.

Service was good, nothing over the top, but quick, efficient, and friendly. The menu had a surprising number of vegan options, all clearly labeled (huge plus!).

Food-wise, the vegan spicy wontons were a highlight, not spicy per se, but super flavorful with a bright, acidic kick that made them so satisfying. The vegan buns were really delicious too! It was a yummy mushroom filling. The chili oil they serve is next-level. I'd bottle that stuff if I could.

The cucumber salad was fresh and light, though probably not something I'd rush to order again. But the rice cakes? Magical. Chewy, perfectly cooked, and packed with flavor. 

And the lychee martinis? Out. Of. This. World. Fruity, fragrant, and dangerously drinkable.

All in all, highly recommend. Definitely planning to go back!",5,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PRt1Ocm-4LJZXixkejisqA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5fW9gosa14dSzANvGw_gNQ/o.jpg,Vegan Buns (2 each),Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,Elizabeth L.,23/7/2025,"Beautiful restaurant and had a lovely server (didn't catch her name but she was great). Ordered two crab xlb, green beans, beef noodle soup and chocolate xlb.

Crab XLB: 5/5 really appreciate how clean this XLB tasted. Good crab to pork ratio, nice flavors and wrapper wasn't too thick.

Green beans: 4/5 very crispy (haven't found this level of crispiness in other restaurants) but a bit too oily/salty for me. 

Beef Noodle Soup: 3/5 a bit underwhelming, especially for a $21 dish. Beef is very tender. Flavor is OK - have had better and worse beef noodle soups but this was the smallest and most expensive one I've had. 

Chocolate XLB: 3/5 ordered this bc of the positive reviews. Honestly it tastes exactly like what it sounds like. Chocolate in XLB wrapper. Chocolate wasn't especially good and the XLB wrapper was undercooked. The best part was the sea salt cream our server recommended (additional $1.50 on top of the $14 dish) 

Overall, it was a decent but expensive experience (lunch for a total of $130 for two). If I go again, it'd be for the vibes and savory xlb only.",4,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lxQEKLkj6MRMaeP0FOEvbA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SkiFxPkm-B8tAaec27zUAw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ppp-deD43sGaLVziP9qAfg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xRF3G7egVstmQkAVKhbu-A/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/i9_wnqc6988yUS1OHPGQbg/o.jpg,,Food & Beverage

Our party was two adults and 2 children and we arrived early on Friday evening and would say everything from food, service and ambiance was top notch!
We were seated quickly and our server Sam was very kind and knowledgeable. They have a great selection of various iced teas as well as a full bar for beer and cocktails.
We ordered the soup dumplings, cucumber salad, string beans,  shrimp fried rice, beef scallion, and fried noodles.
The soup dumplings were the star of the show for sure, but the rice and string beans were close second. The beef was good too but it was more like a sautee vs. traditional steak.
For desert we had chocolate dumplings and mango ice desert. Both excellent! Unique and great experience, especially for kids as they get to see how dumplings are made.

The staff is very courteous and the food service was quite fast, considering how busy they were. They had all glass walls looking into the kitchen so you can see the staff prepping the dumplings. It's a bit dark inside but it in does well for the sleek modern vibe.

We ordered an assortment of dumplings and baos from their menu and all of them tasted delicious!  My favorite was the spicy wontons. That spicy sauce must be homemade because it was the perfect amount of savory to spice and it was delicious  we wanted to put that sauce on all of our dumplings. The dumpling skins were soft and thin and the fillings inside were flavorful and the Xiao Long Baos had just the perfect amount of broth in them.

I think the shrimp fried rice was pretty mediocre, but I don't think you could go wrong with any of the soup dumplings or wontons.

Din Tai Fung,Stephanie A.,11/8/2025,"I walked by this place after getting off at the 50th Street subway station and was intrigued. A friend mentioned it was good, so I made a last-minute early reservation for brunch the following day.

In terms of ambiance and decor, this restaurant is beautiful. No notes. It feels clean and fresh, modern yet traditional, and even has windows to see the dumpling making. Would be a great vibe for either family dining or a date (or brunch with friends, as was my case).

Menu highlights definitely include the sea salt cream black tea and the chocolate buns. I would drink that tea every day if I could--it was amazing. The chocolate buns (which you can get with a side of that same sea salt cream) were like little lava cakes and so good. As for the savory food, all of it was fine. The ribs had the BEST sauce, but I'm not a rib person--I wish the sauce came on something else--but my friends loved them. The soup dumplings were good, but not as amazing as I expected for a place known for its soup dumplings. I did not enjoy the diced beef noodles, though my friend did. The black sesame espresso martini was good--and an NYC exclusive.

Hands down one of the best dining experiences we've had in NYC! Din Tai Fung lives up to the hype and more -- from its gorgeous location and stylish decor to its absolutely delicious food and exceptional service.

We started with the cucumber salad, which was refreshingly perfect. The famous xiao long bao were a huge hit with my kids -- they couldn't stop raving about how flavorful and juicy they were! As a vegetarian, I was thrilled to find so many veg and vegan options. The green beans with chili oil were perfectly crisp and spicy, and the spicy noodles were truly out of this world.

My son ordered the black pepper beef tenderloin, which he declared ""phenomenal."" But the ultimate standout? The chocolate and mochi xiao long bao with sea salt milk foam -- pure heaven in every bite!

A special shoutout to our server Karma, who gave fantastic recommendations and made the whole experience even better. We had such a blast dining here as a family.

Din Tai Fung,Keyana S.,9/8/2025,"growing up i watched a lot of youtube videos, and one of the most memorable types were food reviews. i remember seeing this restaurant and being more than disappointed when i found out they didn't have a new york location. you could probably imagine my surprise once i saw they were opening one in the city. 

let's start off with the reservations. the hype has died down tremendously, i believe on their site they have a waitlist so you can join if it's a spur of  the moment sort of thing. i still prefer to book my reservations through yelp. when you walk in, you had down the steps and are met with architectural beauty. the space is dimly lit with water features and it's extremely spacious.  i checked in at the host stand and we had to wait maybe 3 minutes for our table to be ready.

when you sit down, you are immediately greeted and they ask if you have ever been to the establishment. everything is pretty straightforward. you get a menu to see the items and their description, along with an ordering sheet. you put the quantity next to the items you want & you can ask for modifications once someone comes back to put the sheet in. 

i started off with the black tea with sea salt foam. it was very good. would get it again. we ordered the pork and crab xiao long bao, my only critique is that they could've been warmer. i don't think i would get these again. next up were the sweet and sour pork baby back ribs. amazing, 10/10. no notes, i could eat these alone. 

shrimp fried rice and garlic string beans were next to hit the table. i felt like the rice was lacking a bit in flavor but when you mixed it with other items such as the ribs, wonton sauce or soy sauce & vinegar mixture it was good. probably would skip this next time. the garlic string beans were a must have. i don't really care that they're $18, i'd spend that again. 

then we had the spicy chicken wontons and the spicy noodles. i enjoyed both of these a lot. i'm a sucker for dim sum so if i could just eat bowls of wontons, dumplings, etc i would. i saw mixed reviews on the noodles but i thought they were fanatic and i'd get them again.

we ordered some lychee martinis once there was some food in our system and it was great. the lychee was nice in size too. for dessert you know we had to get the chocolate xiao long bao. if i could've gotten 3 orders of these with the sea salt cream, i would've. we also got an order of these taro dumplings, please skip this. 

overall, i enjoyed the experience. must haves are the sweet & sour ribs, green beans, spicy wontons & chocolate dumplings.",5,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gIxYNth2ulesZ7sRTtlAbg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/v_xPRRcpXpTIGThSN_QHEg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/m39gQON_RmnJStTmo81Yww/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fcSK-pkp1phFgSOeeLVcPg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/You4LOzqokLjF8mdTN7Mww/o.jpg,Crab & Kurobuta Pork Xiao Long Bao (10 each); Sweet & Sour Pork Baby Back Ribs; Noodles with Spicy Sauce; Chicken Spicy Wontons (8 each); Pear Lychee Martini,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,Lena Y.,9/8/2025,I've eaten ate at Din Tai Fung in Singapore & HK and this location did not disappoint. It was fun to watch non-asian staff making all the dumplings through the glass window.

Din Tai Fung,Melody C.,20/6/2025,"This was my second time having Din Tai Fung - my first was in Hong Kong. I had thought the soup dumplings were way too small and alright but nothing special during my first visit. Fast forward a couple of years later, I still think that about Din Tai Fung's soup dumplings. But now that my tastebuds are slightly more refined compared to back then, I would also like to say that their pork dumpling filling tastes very clean and healthy. There's not a lot of fat in the meat, the meat tastes like it's of high quality, and without an overwhelming amount of seasoning. 4/5

Their spicy chicken wonton fillings were also similar in that way. The size of the wontons were small, too. I thought the sauce could be spicier (like hot chili oil type of spicy). 3/5

The cucumber salad has a lot of copycat recipes online, so I thought I'd try the real thing. Though unassuming, the cucumber salad is actually really addicting. The freshness and crunch of each cucumber just had me going back for more. I ended up making them at home after with a copycat recipe, and I would have to say they're pretty easy to make! 5/5

Noodles with sesame sauce (with crushed peanuts and chili oil). I feel like this was a waste of money - literally just noodles with sauce,. I wasn't particularly fond of the sesame sauce. It was on the blander side even though it supposedly had chili oil. 2/5

Fried rice with fried pork chop - The rice itself was alright but a little on the blander side. At least you can see the individuality of each grain of rice. It tastes better with a bit of chili oil. I really liked the fried pork chop. I was expecting something katsu-style, but there's no breading (so it appears). It still had a nice crispy crust (not katsu level, of course), and was well seasoned. The meat tasted clean with no fats and was a good amount of tender. 4/5

Chocolate and mochi xiao long bao - I see chocolate xlb online a lot, so I've been really wanting to try it! I honestly didn't know what to expect, as I couldn't imagine chocolate in a xlb. But it was one of my favorite dishes here! The chocolate isn't overwhelmingly sweet. I couldn't tell the difference regarding the mochi and regular dumpling skin. I got a side of sea salt cream (extra $1) to go with it, and I think it was a nice touch. Couldn't really taste the cream, but it added to the texture. 5/5

This place is reservations only. They give you a 15-minute grace period if you're late, but honestly, I think you have a bit longer than that. Because after I entered, I still had to wait in a medium-sized line to check in for my reservation. Once checked in, they give you a buzzer, so you still have to wait a bit before you actually get seated. I probably waited less than 10 minutes? 

The restaurant has a really nice ambiance and definitely is going for the elevated route. There are a lot of tables inside, so many different parties at once. Each area on the floor is sectioned off and assigned to multiple waiters. But despite the crowd size, I never once felt neglected by my waiter, who was very prompt and gave us food suggestions.",4,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ssKDkYje1RgeoecPz0Tgrw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GiuU9aeUirWop39dF25yZQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Mi0-J22ShfTuCPyHMbHyVg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TNFV9lC4VSAZZ1QNcVORpg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PAwNiLWyHKkK9xMQGkwxKg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/a3zzFrkI2kyIUHOld91YdA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mwDnCrJ60zwXMjMtEPKUVg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hekEMP6bBYpbmL1L7liZ1w/o.jpg,Chocolate & Mochi Xiao Long Bao (5 each) really good; Chicken Spicy Wontons (8 each); Side of Sea Salt Cream; Cucumber Salad really good; Kurobuta Pork Buns (2 each); Chicken Spicy Wontons (8 each); Noodles with Sesame Sauce meh; Fried Pork Chop Fried Rice,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,Julia S.,11/8/2025,"This place is totally overrated. It's obviously been hyped up by ""influencers"" because each dish was worse than the one before. It was beyond mediocre : it sucked . I went there with two of my friends took me an hour to pick my fancy clothes and we were expecting something spectacular. It was worse than if an amateur cooked. The string beans with garlic had no salt or flavor the spicy won tons had a load of horrible sauce gross we brought most of this inedible food home for our families but even they wouldnt eat it. 

For example we bought the chicken fried rice with and it had no no soy sauce just fat swollen rice with chunks of chicken

The food isn't bad, but for the price and wait, I can definitely get better food elsewhere especially XLB. The service is really nice and the room is spacious, which you appreciate for NYC. We were in and out within an hour.

Shanghai rice cakes: tried for the first time and it was a good chewy texture with a flavorful sauce. Simple and nice.

Shrimp silky wontons: this was a disappointment, the shrimp was tough compared to when I had it before. It was my favorite dish here.

Black sesame espresso martini: it's more like a cordial as it's very intense even compared to martinis. The flavor was good but do not have to get again.

If you're trying to spend & have a fine meal, sure.
The seasoning/flavor isn't the typical traditional Taiwanese flavors, it definitely feels a bit muted to cater to a certain demographic.

Din Tai Fung,Andrew C.,5/6/2025,"From the bright glass box entrance into the dim subterranean restaurant. The line for checkin can wrap around the bottom of the stairs. This location is a large one, but that doesn't mean you won't wait if you don't have a reservation. We had one and had a wonky check in experience where we were a little lost in the shuffle until one of the hosts took the time to sort us out. 

As the DTF empire has grown, there are definitely subtle differences between the locations. I think quality and consistency has suffered a little. That sad, I think the NYC location is one of the better U.S. locals. The food comes out quickly and it comes out hot. 

It's definitely on my list of goto's when I visit Manhattan.

Din Tai Fung,Johnny G.,7/6/2025,"The place is enormous, it's literally a maze in here. Its perfect for every situation- group dinners, family, causal dates, celebrations. I saw they do have some smaller secluded rooms. I highly suggest getting reservations. It was pretty timely. Waited 5 mins after my reservation time to get seated.

The food is meant to be shared. They suggest 2 items per person is the rule of thumb. We had the frieporkchop fried rice; chicken dumplings; cucumber dish; wonton in their infamous sauce. The cucumber dishes pairs best if you dont eat right away, use it as a palette cleanser throughout the meal. The chicken dumplings were superb probably my favorite out of all the savory dishes. The rest lacked a bit of salt but still good.

Please don't skip the chocolate & mochi dumplings with salted cream. It was a pleasant surprise. I feel like the proper way to consume it is dipping into the cream and eating it whole to mitigate mess.

Din Tai Fung,Kim P.,7/6/2025,"This Michelin star restaurant specializing in their soup dumplings/xiao long bao did not disappoint! Upon entering the restaurant, you can immediately feel the luxurious and dim atmosphere, making it a moody environment for a great dinner experience. Expect a wait considering this restaurant's popularity, but there is plenty of seating in the waiting area and I would recommend making a reservation ahead of time. As a dim sum restaurant, you order using a sheet and numbering the amount of items you want to order from the menu.

The Kurobata Pork Xiao Long Bao were delicious and soft, and the Shrimp & Kurobuta Pork Pot Stickers were crispy and filling. The cucumber salad was quite refreshing and flavorful with the chili oil, and the string beans with garlic are a classic vegetable side. Additionally, the chicken wonton soup was hearty and delicious, and the soup itself was light yet savory. The most unique item I tried was the Chocolate & Mochi Xiao Long Bao, definitely worth the try if you are a chocolate fan! Having this for dessert to end off the meal was spectacular, as I was pleasantly surprised at how rich and creamy the dark chocolate inside paired so well with the mochi in a soup dumplings format.

Din Tai Fung,Linda M.,20/5/2025,"I really wanted to like this place and was really looking forward to this reservation since we had booked this 2 weeks in advance. Reservations are required and it's hard to get for a peak mealtime unless you book a weeknight in advance.
I felt like everyone else had gone to check it out already and that we were late to the game; there is so much hype to the brand name. Unfortunately the place did not live up to their reputation.

We went on a weeknight at 6pm. When you walk in, the ambiance walking down the staircase is stunning. There is a little metal sculpture of a soup dumpling at the bottom of the staircase for photos ops. Then you check in and they give you a pager for when your table is ready. 

As you are seated, you pass by the glass wall where you can see the chefs preparing the xiao long bao (soup dumplings), which is pretty cool. The entire restaurant is lit by very pretty lanterns and you feel a sense of relaxation with the wooden / black decor. 

The food came very quickly. However this is where I felt let down. I felt that the xiao long bao were actually just average. The cucumber salad was honestly a standout, more so than the actual bao. We also enjoyed the cocktails - the sesame espresso martini (nyc exclusive) and the pear martini. 

Unfortunately, the soup dumplings have paper thin skins and lack flavor, even in the truffle soup dumplings which we were warned to have a strong flavor. The chili oil was delicious but I found I had to douse every dumpling in it. We did enjoy the cod dumplings which were surprisingly soupy and full of flavor, more than the xiao long bao.

My boyfriend and I both left the restaurant hungry.

Also subtracting a star due to the price point of the dishes. Very expensive - be prepared for a check somewhere in the ballpark of $100-$200 for a table of 2. The service was very good and there was no trouble finding a waiter when we needed.

Overall I might come back if the occasion comes up but I do think that this brand name is overrated; it is a decent soup dumpling place with classy decor and expensive dishes. Personally, I would prefer a less flashy, more down to earth restaurant for soup dumplings for a much more reasonable price. We both prefer Nan Xiang over Din Tai Fung. 

The only really ""worth-it"" points about this place are the ambiance and this high-society, exclusive feeling of eating at a fancy reservation-only spot. 

Update: originally I rated 4/5 but we both ate more later tonight and felt disappointed in the value. Minus another star. Resulting in a 3/5 rating.

I learned when I walked in that this is the biggest restaurant in NYC, but despite its large size, it truly felt like a welcoming, warm, classy dining experience. We were seated almost immediately and guided through the menu. The vibe is very much family style, and I feel you can't go wrong with anything. We ended up grabbing a good blend of bites from the Xiao Long Bao (Pork) which were so yummy! Not my absolute favorite soup dumplings, but delicious nonetheless. The cucumber salad was not bad! Super refreshing, but I'd probably pass next time I go. The pork chop and sesame noodles were a standout -- SO well cooked, flavorful, and balanced!! Weirdly enough, the STRING BEANS were my absolute favorite though. The flavor, flash fry cooking style, and garlic was divine. I was blown away.

We ended with a mochi/chocolate dumpling with a warm salted caramel cream sauce on the side and it was incredible. Tasted like a warm hot cocoa hug!

I've previously been to the Arcadia and Las Vegas locations, but ironically have never made it to the Taipei flagship despite numerous visits to the island.

Overall, I think Nan Xiang XLB is a better option for Shanghainese cooking in NYC, but DTF is not bad. The vegan steamed dumplings are good, although I generally prefer a bit more bite to the dough. The mu-er (wood ear) salad had a bit too much vinegar for my taste.

The sesame noodles were actually the best thing I tasted here - not something that I recall DTF being known for, but I'd recommend ordering a bowl to share.",4,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ImWrf6WzfLjHu3ca8oQCpg/o.jpg,,Food & Beverage

Din Tai Fung,Helena M.,26/5/2025,"So of course, TikTok has led me to believe I just HAD to try this restaurant, so while in New York we checked out DTF. We had a reservation but we came early and were able to get a seat earlier which was great. 

Food wise, the dim sum was meh. Didn't blow my mind away. The dumplings and the bao were very mid to me, and I've had better elsewhere. However, the food we ordered was good. I got the shrimp noodles and my brother ordered the chicken fried rice. Both were really good and shareable and we were able to split the both of it amongst the two of us.

Vibes were nice, ambiance was nice, definitely a cute place to go but it didn't blow my mind",3,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UFkkvRrwY5A-6SK-Qos9tg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NflxKr3fmgj_Z0n2VqHSUQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DC4tn96xPBaiOLkJG556Tw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qcHcPoJcUkf2_6p_bw8xIQ/o.jpg,,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,Meghna S.,13/7/2025,"Great Dumplings in a Gorgeous Space
We had a lovely lunch at Din Tai Fung on Broadway. The ambience is stunning; big, open, and beautifully designed, making it a great place to relax and enjoy a flavorful meal.
The dumplings were the real star...juicy, perfectly seasoned, and full of flavor. The Crab & Pork Xiao Long Bao and the Kimchi & Pork Dumplings were especially memorable. The shrimp & pork spicy wontons had just the right kick, and the chili oil on the side added an extra zing to everything.
The appetizers (like the seaweed salad and wood ear mushrooms) were decent but didn't quite stand out like the mains. That said, the iced green tea was refreshing and paired beautifully with the rich dumplings.
Only downside: it was super filling! We probably over-ordered, but it's hard not to with so many tempting options.
Friendly service
Great variety
Worth the splurge (our bill for two came to $96 before tip)

Din Tai Fung,Serena C.,16/5/2025,"Din tai Fung was a cool experience! Luckily, it was very easy to make a reservation on Yelp the night before I went to the restaurant.

As soon as I entered the building, I was pleasantly surprised by the ambiance. The furniture and decor made the place feel high end. 

As for the food:
Cucumber salad (3/5): felt like we had to try because it was so famous. It was definitely tasty--acidic, sweet, and refreshing. But it was too pricy for what it is. I don't recommend getting it ($9). 

Kurobuta Pork Xiao Long Bao (4/5): I thought the soup dumplings were quite nice--i like how there are 10 smaller pieces. The presentation of the dumpling folds were beautiful. I thought the meat was delicious and flavorful. The meat was more dense compared to that of other XLBs.

Spicy Vegan Dumplings (5/5): I thought this was the most delicious! The sauce is scrumptious and the vegan filling was a great texture and flavor.

Chocolate and Mochi Xiao Long Baos (5/5): love the concept! It was decadent and so fun to eat, especially with a side of sea salt cream. Recommend getting this because it's hard to get this anywhere else.

Flavored Black Tea (2/5): it tastes good but it was too sweet for my liking.",4,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6wyrkhFBWshZ-XJj5chSzw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kx56KcOr9mi0q0d3uyeKtA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/W6IX8FOUm4crpxbNKx2inw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/33FOL1GLbeTNXPPPQ6PjJA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4Yjl7dq-2LmGfx9CqnNu4g/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7k0IQoJBJlOemXYkOwnk3g/o.jpg,Menu; Cucumber Salad; Flavored Iced Black Tea; Chocolate & Mochi Xiao Long Bao (5 each); Kurobuta Pork Xiao Long Bao (10 each); Vegan Spicy Wontons (8 each),Food & Beverage

Din Tai Fung,Jim G.,13/8/2025,"So, friends, family and I have made our rounds at many of the Din Tai Fung locations. My son has been to the one in Taiwan, my best friend has been to San Jose & Las Vegas and I have been to San Jose & NYC. When we compare notes it stands out that the focus is on consistency and perfection.  We all have been a fan of the seaweed salad, but the soup dumplings are the star of the show. I found the dumplings in NYC to be a little bit thicker than the ones in CA. The decor of the dining room in NYC is wonderful and one of the largest seating areas in the city. (For those of you that were here in the late 1990's this was the location of MARS 2112 an amazing tourist themed space dining experience. Step into a UFO and you were immediately transported to Mars.) I enjoy the open kitchen where you can see the dumplings being hand made. All locations are very popular. You will need a reservation or at least be on the waitlist. If you are alone and the restaurant is not over crowded sitting at the bar is always an option. We went at lunch time and were seated immediately. The hostess and the server were very friendly and we were given a complimentary tea at the end of our meal. I was very satisfied with the entire experience. I did note that of the different locations the NYC restaurant has little more cooperate clientele even though it is located at the fringe of Times Square. So easy to access from the #1 subway at the 50th Street exit.

Din Tai Fung,Sushma K.,6/5/2025,"Amazing as usual. The perfect spot for soup dumplings. Ambiance is outstanding at the NYC location and since we stayed 5 mins of a walk from the location, it was easy to make reservation and get in. Even though it was a weekday in the afternoon it was pretty packed! Goes to say, this location has been on of the most classiest Ding Tai Fung locations I have been too. 

I was a bit disappointed with the pork bao as i expected it to be a lot more different and better, but sadly it only turned out to be a meatball inside. The classics were the soup  dumplings and the egg fried rice and the chicken spicy wantons.

Din Tai Fung,Katie B.,14/8/2025,"The general restaurant lighting is dark, but it's perfectly adequate at the tables. Drinks were super quick, and the espresso martini was the best I've had anywhere in the city. Our server had some amazing recommendations, but I would say to order on the ""light"" side. Our server recommended three-four items per person, but we could hardly finish two per person. The food is delivered and served ""family style,"" so I also wouldn't recommend doubling up on any items except dessert. All in all, every item that arrived was better than the next, and it was perfectly timed. Perfect photo ops everywhere in the restaurant and in the lobby area. My only ""negative"" comment would be the timing of how the items arrive. Towards the end of our meal, the vegetarian dishes finally arrived; this left some at the table without food while plate upon plate of food arrived for others. This was likely an oversight or a miscommunication, and it would not deter us from a future visit.",5,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7-oASEnup5Zwyhn977ldLg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/a4yiOqQlHVWbb0odaDco6g/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-tiDfZH9E3sJ3puCrZ6c_w/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XJl1Y9oavRBH4G4V1pLx4g/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/b4kWii3H2T-TRQcsEr0xJA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yXEGMesQQ42Vt-6f22HGkQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/026wU7r-sFY2-CZC7ZYZRA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dUZZClvUgVkciBa1lVuZrA/o.jpg,Chocolate & Mochi Xiao Long Bao (6 each); Espresso martini; Fun Photo Stop; Kurobuta Pork Xiao Long Bao (10 each); Entrance; The amazing view of the kitchen; The bar area was such a vibe; Vegan Dumplings (10 each),Food & Beverage

They then give you a buzzer and you wait to be called to get seated. Now for the food.I must say the freshly made dumplings are great the soup dumplings the taro dumplings I really enjoyed.  The green beans were great. The bok choy was too bland for me no flavor. The fried rice both shrimp and then chicken was excellent made up for the lack of flavor from the bok choy.

Din Tai Fung,Arya M.,6/7/2025,"Was so excited for this to finally open up here on the East Coast after only having it when venturing out West. Word of caution, it is DIFFICULT to get a reservation at a typical lunch or dinner time even during the week. Weekend evenings seem almost impossible to get, so I haven't even tried to venture out to that.

Service is generally good, but I will say it doesn't quite stack up to the California locations I've been to. Had my order wrong a couple times on top of extremely delayed wait times, however they were willing to make up for it so I do want to recognize that. I will say though I wish they brought out drinks earlier, seems typical for to bring out drinks and then followed immediately by your first couple of items.

Food items typically come out one after the other. It's DTF so you aren't going to go wrong with the quality as everything is made fresh. This location even lets you see the chefs in the kitchen rolling the dough and filling from a large window. Xiaolongbao is what they are famous for, but my favorite is and always will be the dessert. I really come for that alone. It's always worth getting the sweet cream with it.

Din Tai Fung,Alissa W.,28/6/2025,"Big dim sum fan here! And very experienced in the NYC area dim sum scene. This place was so delicious and delightful. We had pork soup dumplings, potstickers, pork buns, and rice shu mai. Potstickers were good but not too interesting. Soup dumplings were fresh, with thin skins and tasty broth. Pork buns were nicely steamed with a good bun to meat ratio. By far, the rice shu mai were my favorite - perfectly cooked and excellent flavor combination!! Those I could order every day and be happy. But fortunately for my body, it is a rare treat. 100% would and will go again. A little pricey compared to in Chinatown but really nice for midtown.

You can make reservations online. But if you don't and end up sitting at the bar, don't fret. Ask for Brandon if he's working then and he will take excellent care of you. And if he's not there, the others were very nice too. 

Be sure to turn around while you're in the restaurant because towards the back, there's a big clear window where you can see all the chefs, busy folding and making all the dumplings and noodles .

Din Tai Fung,Ankitha D.,1/4/2025,"My experience at Din Tai Fung was a mixed bag overall. As a vegetarian, I did find that there were enough options to have a meal that was filling. I went here for my birthday dinner, and we ordered a bunch of items. Our favorites were the cucumber salad, vegan spicy wontons, and our dessert, the chocolate and mochi xiao long bao with sea salt cream. Tbh I would mainly come back for this dessert, the other food was not all that worth coming back for.

I would say my biggest negative on this restaurant is the service. First, you have to order your items on a paper and it isn't very personal with your server since different people take the paper and bring you your food. My fiancé mentioned that it was my birthday and the server rudely said ""we don't do anything for birthdays"". We didn't even mention it for that reason, and it was very off-putting.

Din Tai Fung,George C.,12/4/2025,"Din Tai Fung is a decent pick if you're in the heart of Times Square, looking for place you can talk with your party and not sit on top of another table.  It's a huge restaurant and is 1 block away from Stardust Diner.

The food here is, overall, pretty good. It definitely is on the more expensive side for Chinese food in NYC - but this is Times Square and Din Tai Fung's first NYC location. We didn't get any pork dishes because one of us is pescatarian, and we didn't feel like we missed anything.

Highlights are: 
-the vegan dumplings spicy sauce (I can just drink that all day, though I think the sauce is used in many dishes
-chocolate mocha xiao long bao - a must have dish
-string beans - pretty good as well. Not the best you'll have in NYC but still good nonetheless

We had a show to go to after dinner and told our waitress that we had to rush. She was great in getting our food ordered and making sure we got all of our dishes in time. She checked in with us and I enjoyed the service!

My one gripe with the restaurant was the music selection. The restaurant looks like a really sleek place - kind of like a Hutong. You can tell there was a lot of thought into the interior design, the wallpaper, the place setting, etc. But the music was off the night we went - kind of reminds me of listening to a Christian rock type of radio station on a long road trip when you're in the middle of nowhere and you didn't plan on listening to it. 

Otherwise, we could suggest coming here. Just don't expect the best best Chinese food and expect to pay a bit more for dumplings.",4,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fDkPiHx-vRdzvJPcUjbJAg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jelW86Jb4PCoALrEiRlplA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pB5T3L16kRe44HFnPKXv6Q/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/T_xkTNWh6s5qfQuhEwwmFw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/i-qZUkzeR8_wkvt8QKFzRQ/o.jpg,String Beans with Garlic; Vegetable Vegan Dumplings (10 each); Chocolate & Mochi Xiao Long Bao (5 each); Shrimp Fried Rice; Cod Dumplings (10 each),Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,Annushka K.,12/4/2025,"Good service, good food, very busy. Never expected their cucumber salad to be so crisp and delicious. String beans with garlic were an absolute perfection. Kurobuta pork soup dumplings were quite tasty, didn't really like sticky rice Shao Mai with mushrooms- tasted bizarre. Pork buns were simply okay, too much dough; however great flavors in the chicken wonton soup, as well as the noodles with spicy sauce. Chocolate buns for dessert looked cool, but tasted very ordinary.

No. But it was a good meal.",4,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wvT3sEeR8eFgiHBhDLVgWg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/c0oEzUUlVeqxa8ni3Wyhww/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AgKBED8JNu5NAMZc9hg7lQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/m1JbiOeMlIWpT_jPCznaUA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/W79ZqoYWtpP3e1eED_uGew/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PdaXF72654QkW99FO9VeBg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Q61uDSyod2nSqDHl806Ukg/o.jpg,,Food & Beverage

Din Tai Fung,Anna P.,25/6/2025,This restaurant is beautiful and you wouldn't expect how big is from the outside. The food was not as impressive. The cucumber salad had a nice crunch but bland. The shrimp and pork xiao long baos were juicy but nothing I haven't had before. The chili wontons were a little sweet and not really spicy. Chocolate mochi xiao long baos were warm and chocolately. I expected the skin to be more chewy like mochi but it just seemed like regular wonton skins. There's an option to get sea salt cream on the side which I think helped balance the chocolate. Servicer was friendly and took time to answer any questions. The food was fine but for the price it's not worth another visit.,3,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qysUZHb8RMnwwl9NWjkEUA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8fjyBuOBOMSiymSUQuAkxA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZOicRe0TzCdJQgevMjADOQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5ivpbAEWL2wRyIZ__bamjw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EKcngsLGC76hVihNVOhDtg/o.jpg,Chocolate and mochi Xiao long bao; Cucumbers salad; Chocolate and mochi Xiao long baos; Shrimp and pork Xiao long baos; Shrimp and pork spicy wontons,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,Andrea S.,25/6/2025,"One of my favorite restaurants in SoCal. This place has THE best xiao long bao. I had the pork xiao long bao which had thin skin and delicious soup inside the dumplings. The rice cakes with kurobata pork were good too. I liked the glass noodle bean curd appetizer too which is refreshing. We also got the beef noodle soup which was delicious and not too spicy! I made a reservation beforehand.

Din Tai Fung,Jin K.,24/6/2025,"Went here for lunch.  What fancy interior!  I've been to Din Tai Fung - the original one in the US in Arcadia.  That place, you went for the food, not for the decor.  Somehow the fancy decor doesn't quite fit with the type of food they are serving.  I not complaining, mind you, but the place seems a little too fancy for humble dumplings.

Having said that the food is pretty good, although honestly not as good as the Arcadia location.  XLB did not have enough soup inside the dumplings, which was a bit disappointing.  

I personally think plain pork ones are better than the crab and pork but others at the table liked the crab and pork ones better.  Dumplings in chili oil was excellent.  Would recommend this item along with XLB.  We also tried sesame noodles, dan dan noodles, and Shanghai rice cakes.  All were okay but stick with dumplings.

For other dishes, we tried cucumbers, woodear mushrooms, sautéed green beans, and wok choi.  They all paired very well with the dumplings and so I would recommend.

Finally, service was efficient and they paced the food for us so that we didn't just get all our order at our table at once.

I would recommend, especially if you are into nice modern dining decor to go along with your dumplings.",4,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,,,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,Irene C.,16/6/2025,"I came here for lunch last Thursday with my team- there were 10 of us in total. I'm the only Asian in the group and I actually grew up in Taiwan, so I was really excited to introduce everyone to Din Tai Fung. Thankfully, the food and vibe totally lived up to the hype! 
Everyone loved it, and a few coworkers even said they want to bring our business partners here next time.

That said, the reservation system was a bit of a headache. They only accept online reservation , but you can only book for up to 6 people online. If you have more than 6 people , you're forced to make two separate reservations--but here's the catch: the system won't let you do that using the same name, phone number, email, or even credit card. It flags it and rejects the second booking, which was super frustrating.

I emailed their booking team to ask how to reserve for 10 people, and they basically sent a standard response suggesting we book a private room... for $1,400. And that doesn't include food or drinks. I get it--it's Midtown NYC--but honestly, who's paying $1,400 just for a room for lunch?

In the end, we managed to make it work, and we really enjoyed the food and service. It's a great spot and I'd totally recommend it--but I really hope they update their reservation system to make it easier for larger groups.",4,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,,,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,Jacklyn P.,21/3/2025,"I finally made my way to Din Tai Fung, and while some dishes lived up to the hype, others left me wanting more. Here's my breakdown for one of  the hardest restaurant to get into:

Chicken Soup Dumplings - 4/10
These were disappointing. Tiny, with barely any soup inside. If you're craving real soup dumplings, I'd recommend hitting up a hole-in-the-wall spot in Chinatown or Flushing instead.

Spicy Pork Wontons - 8/10
Pleasantly surprised! I've had better, but these were still solid. I went in with sky-high expectations thanks to social media, but while they weren't a perfect 10, they were definitely worth ordering.

Spicy Noodles - 8/10
A simple but tasty dish. Not very spicy on its own, but pro tip: save the sauce from the spicy pork wontons and mix it in--it takes the noodles to another level. Also, if you like a real kick, mention your spice preference when ordering.

Garlic String Beans - 10/10
Easily the best side dish on the table. Perfectly cooked, crunchy, and loaded with flavor without being overly garlicky. I'd come back just for these.

Spicy Cucumbers - 9/10
A great balance of spicy and sweet. I make these at home often, and while these weren't mind-blowing, they were definitely a refreshing and shareable starter.

Chocolate Xiao Long Bao - 10/10
The absolute star of the meal! Warm, gooey dark chocolate inside a soft bun--it was pure indulgence. I don't even love dark chocolate, but this wasn't bitter at all. Pro tip: Add the sea salt cream for $3. It's worth every penny.

Honey Lemonade - 10/10
Light, refreshing, and even better with boba. A great way to balance out all the bold flavors.

Would I go back? Yes! But next time, I'm going for the fried rice and baby back ribs--I saw them pass by, and my mouth was watering.

Overall, a good experience, the waitstaff and hostess was sweet and very attentive. But if you're a hardcore soup dumpling fan, you might want to set your expectations accordingly.",4,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/k0Iuir4OBUmgqWGu3sXrLQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7AS3q40cQ5eofqS4J5Zakg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QKojeNoyW6UEz0jGbrhqxA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mBYLbNyV0AyV6e6MB_MGnA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/twxFlS5OiYt9Ya-Dw-YZUA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QPfw-tBvXrKTX6zxp8yx2w/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/y9_JRu485-kXIsWT4qhGFQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IKftySu3694zqMv3J-2bjw/o.jpg,Chocolate & Mochi Xiao Long Bao (5 each); Leche martini- I wish they filled the glass it was only 3/4 filled.; Spicy noodles; Side of Sea Salt Creamsalt; Chicken soup dumpling; Spicy Cucumber Salad; String Beans with Garlic; Pork and shrimp Chicken Spicy Wontons,Food & Beverage

Din Tai Fung,Bret F.,3/4/2025,"I was expecting to be blown out of the water considering all the hype leading up to eating here. You can only get in with a reservation, no walk ins. It's a giant gorgeous space. Service along with some of the dishes was pretty good. 

The musts:
-Sweet & sour pork baby back ribs. Fell off the bones. Comes with 6. Could have had another order!
-Spicy pork wontons. The flavors!!!
-Chocolate & mochi xiao long bao - you bite into it and the chocolate starts flowing. Eat them in one bite or expect a mess. So rich and delicious! (add the sea salt cream)
-Sweet taro mochi xiao long bao - a surprising sweet treat (again add the sea salt cream)

Good:
-Pork fried rice
-Espresso martini - unique to the NYC location only (per the menu)
-Cucumber gin martini

Meh:
-Chicken soup dumplings (they were cold - Ive never had a cold soup dumpling)
-Cucumber salad is nothing special.
-Pork buns are a solid mound of flavorless pork

Don't forget to look into the kitchen and watch them making the dumplings. For a Times Square restaurant the bill wasn't too bad. $100 per person including all above.

Din Tai Fung,Lauren P.,3/4/2025,"I hate to say but this was slightly underwhelming. Everyone knows how popular Din Tai Fung has gotten so of course I had to make a reservation while in the city. We snagged a lunch reservation on a Friday and this restaurant is massive! We got seated after waiting maybe 10 minutes and our server came around pretty quick after. One of our friends had a garlic and onion allergy (I know, I know) BUT they were super accommodating and every plate that got delivered they told us if it had garlic or onion in it. 

I think my favorite dishes were the garlic green beans and cucumber salad. The dumplings were good but honestly, the Trader Joe's soup dumplings taste pretty similar to these. Which is still good! Just not blown away by it. I feel like the prices were fair and I loved how you could watch them make all of the dumplings.

garlic green beans: 4/10 nothing too special could use a bit more seasoning

crab and Kurobuta pork soup dumplings: 8/10 pretty good but nothing too crazy

chicken chili oil wontons: 8/10 ^

chocolate dumplings sea salt sauce: 100/10 omg my favorite dessert, I've been thinking about it since I had it last time, with the sea salt cream is even better

Green tea with salt cream: 10/10 the perfect drink! not too sweet

Our order:
1. Chicken Spicy Wonton:  Beautiful flavor.  Spice was there, but not overwhelming. 
2. Pork XLB:  Loved these.  Nothing overwhelming.  Lovely flavor and the soup inside was the perfect temperature.  
3. Kimchi and Kurobuta pork dumpling:  Good, but not a lot of flavor. We dipped them in the spicy wonton sauce and that gave them a little extra kick.  
4. Pork buns: Best nap bun I've ever had.  The buns aren't sweet at all and the pork inside was seasoned perfectly.  
5. Sticky Rice Shao Mai with Kurobuta pork and Mushroom:  An earthier flavor due to the mushrooms, but I loved it.  

First dish came out quickly and they served one more dish at a time about every three minutes.  It was too fast for us.  We felt very rushed and the table became cluttered with dishes.  I would've liked to enjoy each dish without feeling like I needed to move on.

Having said that, food is still of a high quality. I would teally just focus on cucumbers and soup dumplings.
Pork soup dumplings where perfect together with their signature cucumbers and noodles, wonton and string beans.
Ended up ordering a bunch since we were fine to have leftovers home.
Didn't like the crab soup dumplings... taste was way too strong, too fishy not reminding me crab at all.
The regular pork buns were good and worth it.
Felt that fried rice was kind of plain but good since it was more a side for us.
Amazing surprise on the string beans- so good

Din Tai Fung,Ashley P.,2/3/2025,"Pleasantly surprised by the size of this place! After entering rhe restaurant you head downstairs to the lobby area to check in and really see the full dining area. The check in experience is a little confusing at first - especially as a first timer- luckily it wasn't that crowded when we went. 

We had to wait a bit past our reservation time even though there were many empty tables and we were eventually sat. I was confused by the hostess explanation of how we could order via the QR code on the menu sheet or via our server. And then lo and behold we were suppose to also fill out the sheet regardless. Didn't know we were taking a test! 

After being school on Din Tai Fung etiquette we finally we were able to order. Our server spoke in a whisper so it was extremely hard to hear him, guess this is where the paper and pencil comes in handy! But we eventually started to get food. 

Thankfully I came here here for food and not for the ordering process because the differing types of buns and dumplings and noodles made up for the annoyances to get there. 

Highly enjoyed all of the dishes we ordered: pork soup dumplings, kimchi and pork dumplings, pork buns, chicken spicy wontons, & chicken fried noodles.

They have a reservation line or a walk in line. We went to the walk in line and they immediately sat us at the bar. I was very impressed with how clean the bar was, all the servers looked clean and tidy as well. We ordered dishes and split them, I thought the food was delicious, my only gripe was I with the soup dumplings actually had more broth in them. Other than that everything was great even the price I thought was on the lower end for NYC. This restaurant was huge- even rooms off to the side were having business meetings.

My daughter and I are soup dumplings aficionados, we love them and have tried sooo many great ones. We were truly underwhelmed with the soup dumplings here which was surprising to us. 

But I would probably give a limb for the recipes for the string beans and spicy wontons. Get an order for yourself! You won't want to share! The chocolate dumplings are nice but nothing to write home about.

Din Tai Fung,Vincent F.,9/3/2025,"3 star to 3.5
Finally got the chance to come here for lunch after hearing so many good claims about it (""best xiao long baos in the world""). This is my honest review and what we ordered. We ordered Crab Xiao Long Bao, regular pork xiao long bao(XLB), string beans with garlic, and sweet and sour baby back pork ribs, dessert: chocolate mochi XLB with sea salt cream.

The baby back pork ribs were pretty tasty. They were tender and had a slightly smoky taste which is well incorporated. (4/5)

The string beans with garlic were done perfectly. Exactly the right texture (from blanching) and then stir-frying. (5/5)

Finally, the xiao long bao. Overall, they were.......underwhelming. Both crab and regular tasted a bit bland with little seasoning/marination for the filling. The only redeeming factor was the thin yet plyable dumpling skin. They nailed the dumpling skin almost perfectly in any ideal XLB. However, the XLB, as a whole, pales in comparison to shanghainese style XLB (Din Tai Fung is a Taiwanese-influenced version). The flavor is not there. The soup is not there (literally not there, 5ml per dumpling). 
Crab (3/5), Regular (2/5)

Dessert: (2.5/5) chocolate filling XLB. Tastes exactly how it looks and sounds nothing special or great.

Overall, it was kind of disappointing. I can definitely say, this is not even close to the ""best soup dumplings in the world"". I would rank this somewhere in the middle. The filling fell flat and sad, no love, no soul, just a wasted piece of pork (basically boiled with some salt). I really wanted to like this place and I was very hungry before eating here. Unfortunately, this was exactly as I suspected it would be: overhyped.

The sweet & sour pork baby back ribs were delish. So were the garlicky green beans. Wish I ordered a side of rice to enjoy them with (personal preference)

You must make a reservation if you want to eat dinner at a reasonable hour. It was packed for a Tuesday night. Our main waiter was Nico and he was very pleasant and helped us decide which plates to choose.

We were given an ordering slip where we wrote down the number of each we wanted. We got the popular pork xiao long bao. It was small and the broth inside was a room temperature. Our other dishes were pretty good. The plates would come out as they were ready. There was no order that it was going in and it was always a different waiter giving us our plate. For dessert, we ordered the chocolate mochi with salt cream foam. The chocolate inside was warm but the dough was not the typical mochi dough I was expecting. It was the same dough that was used to make the soup dumplings. The foam added some saltiness to cut the sweetness of the chocolate but truthfully it was probably not needed.

So far every outpost outside of Taiwan has been really disappointing for me. London - bleh, Shanghai - meh. NYC though got it right. This location is pretty darn close to the taste and quality of the Taipei locations. 

First and foremost, this must be the nicest DTF I've ever been in. They spared no expense and the decor is high end. In terms of food, everything met the high standard I'm used to eating at their Taipei locations with the best items being of course the original soup dumplings but the dessert baos are sneaky good. Red bean with mochi is a great way to end the meal and the chocolate soup dumplings were a hit with the family. Service here was great and our food came out quickly. Price is what you'd expect for a big name franchise opening its first location in NY.

The other dishes such as the chili wontons, shumai, and pork chop rice are also solid. The shumai is more like a wonton in that the shrimp and pork are in separate layers and the pork chop is grilled, not fried. 

The service is just okay - not super attentive and we had to remind them to get 2 items which were forgotten. 

4 stars for the food and 3 for the service but will round to a 4.",4,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cPxYQ53_IlJzzUlbFCpjyw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nk2uT801fJ6pm41Pw04ZVg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QHSou0kl4MBGP0XJU0IgMA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bWKeAPeXoG2qXBrp_DYccA/o.jpg,,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,Jackie G.,6/6/2025,"If you've been around here long enough, you already know I have a serious crush on Din Tai Fung. Tokyo stole my heart first, then San Diego kept the spark alive, and now--hello, New York.

On a recent quick trip to the city with my friend Alex, I had just one day, one Broadway show, and one mission: get to Din Tai Fung at all costs. I made a reservation for 1:15 PM like the responsible adult I pretend to be, but then the day unraveled faster than a Chinatown knockoff purse. We missed the 15-minute grace window, and I thought the dumpling dream was over.

But never underestimate my determination (or my pleading skills). After our show, we sprinted to Din Tai Fung's new location inside the Shops at Columbus Circle. Yes, it's their first East Coast spot, and it's massive. When we arrived, I went straight to the host stand and met Haya, who instantly restored my faith in humanity. I explained our tragic missed reservation, and she smiled like someone who's seen it all. She popped us on the waitlist and directed us to the bar. Each interaction with her was wonderful.  She easily made conversation and genuinely looked like she enjoys her job .

At the bar, I ordered my go-to: the Pear Lychee Martini. It's sweet, refreshing, and sneaky--exactly how I like my drinks. One drink in and boom, our table was ready. Just like that. Dumpling destiny, baby.

Naturally, I wasted no time and ordered two baskets of the Kurobuta Pork Xiao Long Bao. These little soup bombs never miss. The wrapper is thin and delicate, the broth is flavorful, and the temperature is perfectly ready-to-eat (no lip-scorching here). I don't know how they do it, but I don't ask questions. I just eat.

Now, let's talk about the Great Soup Dumpling Debate. Alex followed the ""proper"" technique: place the dumpling on a spoon, poke it open, sip the soup, then bite. I, on the other hand, am more of a thrill-seeker. I pop the whole thing in my mouth like I'm defusing a delicious bomb. We agreed to disagree and ordered another round.

Final thoughts: Din Tai Fung is now officially a non-negotiable part of my NYC (and California) routine. The food is consistent, the service is kind, and the dumplings are borderline emotional support-worthy.

Din Tai Fung,Victoria S.,2/3/2025,"So happy to have snagged a reservation for this location. Been to one outpost in Taipei (not the original) and it was phenomenal.  Hoping to have the same magic replicated here.  

This location is larger, with a more upscale feeling (love the walk down).  Checking in is seamless with a pager. Separate waiting areas exist (part with those with pagers, another section for those whose pagers have gone off).

Food menu is in a laminated large sheet. Drink menu is in a separate black booklet.  A paper menu inventory sheet is also included for the customer to check off order items. Waitstaff will read it and confirm before sending to the kitchen. 

We shared the vegan spicy noodles, vegan wontons in spicy sauce and cod fish steamed dumplings.  Everything came out perfectly.  The wontons were stuffed with mushrooms, garlic, scallion and bean thread noodles pieces.  The skin was perfectly cooked but still firm enough to hold the filling. The spicy sauce had hints of vinegar, soy and chilis.  

The noodles had perfect chew and were tossed in radish, scallions, chili, vinegar and other spices.  It was tasty.

The star was the steamed dumplings.  They arrived piping hot in a bamboo steamer.  The filling was juicy and fish was very fresh.  Each dumpling was a nice crescent shape with a set # of folds.

Din Tai Fung,Huiwen C.,29/1/2025,"Get the crab xiao long bao and the pork chop fried rice! The crab ones have a strong crab flavor and are full of umami. The soup dumplings have a thin wrapper layer and are packed with soup. For the sauce, I recommend using more vinegar and eating each soup dumpling with some ginger to cut the richness. The pork soup dumplings are good as well, but the crab ones are superior. The pork chop fried rice has perfectly cooked pork chop on top of egg fried rice. This was seasoned really well.

Some disappointments were the noodles with sesame sauce and the chocolate xiao long bao. Definitely pass on the noodles with sesame sauce - this is literally noodles with some sesame sauce, it was rather bland and didn't have much depth in flavor. The chocolate xiao long baos came a bit cracked, which was fine, but it was extremely sweet! Even with a sweet tooth, this was way too sweet. They also take over 15 minutes to come out.

Din Tai Fung,Jay C.,1/3/2025,"So glad another vegan-friendly restaurant opened up in midtown for pre or post-Broadway show meals. Din Tai Fung is a great addition. While they don't have a vegan version of their Xiao Long Bao, the soup dumpling that got them famous, they have plenty of other tasty options. 

Hard to pick a favorite but standouts include the spicy wonton, Taiwanese cabbage with garlic, and a recent discovery, the Shanghai rice cakes. This is the type of place where you can't go wrong with any of your choices. The dim sum order form clearly lists the vegan options, making it easy to pick out and order them. If you have any questions, the servers are friendly and knowledgeable. Despite the cavernous dining room they have to cover, they are always nearby. You can even watch the kitchen staff roll the dumplings through a glass window on one side of the floor.

Reservations open a month in advance. Make them as early as possible.

We were dining out for a birthday and were fortunate to get a private room for a party of 8 hassle-free, i.e. no prix-fixe menus or advanced payments required. The restaurant is that popular that the space would easily be scooped up by other patrons if there was a no-show. Thankfully we were all there on-time and the staff was prompt in seating us. It was very interesting walking to our take and watching the glass-window room where all the magic of making the dumplings happens. Everything was on point- the food, the service, and the setting especially our nice semi-private section that had large tv monitors looked like it could be used to hold meetings or convert to a karaoke room. While the soup dumplings were not the best I've ever had, they were freshly made in-house and still juicy and very good.

Din Tai Fung,Bill S.,25/1/2025,"Outstanding Chinese restaurant in NYC. 

Definitely get the Pork Xiao Long Bao. But I thought the truffle version was not worth the cost. Stick with the original pork version!

I night recommend ordering the Sticky Rice Shao Mai with Kurobuta Pork & Mushroom as it is super delicious and far superior to any other Chinese restaurant I have visited. 

In fact, everything g here is excellent including the Shanghai Rice Cakes with shrimp or pork. 

The only bummer here is that this place is still very hard to get reservations unless you plan 30 days in advance. So be warned, if you want to dine here (and you would be crazy to miss this place) you need to plan ahead and book reservations.

Din Tai Fung,Evelyn M.,26/2/2025,"I got here five minutes early to my reservation and was handed a disk to wait for my table. I guess it makes sense because it would be easier to buzz the disk instead of yelling out someone's name but part of me felt annoyed because there was only one other party waiting and they seated them and a party that came in after me, first. Already I was feeling annoyed.... If there isn't a lot of folks waiting, I thought the disk was excessive, unnecessary, and in my part, delayed me getting my table because it looked like a tech issue.

When we were seated, I asked for still water, which comes in a bottle and they gave me tap. Ok... fine, slightly annoyed but I wasn't going to lose my mind over it. Then when they were serving us our food, one of the servers passing by almost knocked over our large bottle of water and my friend got splashed. When they cleared our table for dessert, they didn't replace our spoons for the chocolate XLB, so we had to eat the little buns whole, or spill the chocolate on our plates, which you can see happened to me. Because of that, I wasn't fully able to enjoy my dessert or finish the sea salt foam (like how do you expect me to enjoy foam with chopsticks). Yes - I could have asked for spoons, but this entire experience made me feel like our service was not attentive at all, literally throwing the food at us. 

Abysmal service aside, food was also largely unimpressive. I've been to two Ding Tai Fengs in China and Taiwan, and felt like the quality was not as good in comparison. The XLB were WAY smaller and there was not enough soup in the dumpling, nor did they taste fresh. I was prepared for the soup to burn my tongue, but when I bit into it, it was at room temp, like they've been sitting for a while. The spicy wontons and noodles kind of just tasted the same to me, and was nothing to rave about. The cucumber salad is also massively overhyped-- there are better and larger cucumber salads at local Northern Chinese restaurants. Disappointing. 

The only saving grace of this depressing experience was the chocolate XLB. I love chocolate and having this literally added a star to my review. I was going to leave two stars, but the chocolate XLB was just that awesome. 

100% will probably never come back, unless I could just sit at the bar and have the chocolate XLB.",3,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/reViM7SMkbkRoul8CelvMw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4NCazljKOF8CFzr-L7o2mg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5iNPuY_BnECJ4LdBuav7rw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WYoWSKrEigCXQqyL32gRow/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ofsaXIWq6TdYwo9oTjSxaA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oCI-OC3lxacg9CVcmg5P8g/o.jpg,Kurobuta Pork Xiao Long Bao (10 each); Cucumber SaladCucumber; Chicken Spicy Wontons (8 each); Chocolate & Mochi Xiao Long Bao (5 each),Food & Beverage

Din Tai Fung,Althea L.,21/2/2025,"Compared to all the soup dumplings and Taiwanese street food dishes in NYC, Din Tai Fung stands out as the best. The flavors are quite close to authentic Taiwanese cuisine, bringing a sense of nostalgia for those familiar with the taste.

That said, it's not the same as Din Tai Fung in Taipei. The soup dumpling wrappers, as well as those for wontons and other dumplings, are noticeably thicker and less delicate than Din Tai Fung in Taiwan and Japan. The signature 18 folds on the soup dumplings are not consistent, and the tops are too thick. Watching the chefs in the open kitchen, it's clear that their technique doesn't match the skill level seen in Taiwan.

Among all the dishes we tried, the standout was the sweet and sour baby ribs, which had an authentic flavor and texture. The beef noodle soup was surprisingly good, and the sesame noodles were quite close to the Taiwanese style. While it's understandable that exact replication in a foreign setting is difficult--and the flavors may have been adjusted to suit American preferences--we're just happy to have a place where we can enjoy these familiar street food flavors.",4,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TcMPqjQIIqS887UGBXwl8A/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-qf2atFF7PHthqQ4YXKNpQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DUZ47xJkQDff0d0LVPCbyQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6NLYBSp0c04npXqnEwZ9ag/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ur_fxyAKwmXdbLEkIOrZZQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-MGj-j8CL1BrIM5eTvzwug/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WE0flJ7qQcOtmItlpuWAqw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/v9wjGbrMaYu4B_O34rw0cw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/w5LThyiupbdRLXTo3VKwrw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AxvWLhdASHTxqT6lJ8loAQ/o.jpg,Menu; Shrimp & Kurobuta Pork Shao Mai; Noodles with Sesame Sauce 擔擔麵; Cocktail menu; Pork Chop Fried Rice; Chocolate & Mochi Xiao Long Bao with Side of Sea Salt Cream; Hot & Sour Soup; Black sesame espresso martini,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,Tony Y.,26/1/2025,"This place is huge. A lot bigger than I expected. It sits in the old space of Mars 2112 for those that remember. We had a 2:15 reservation and checked in but still had to wait another 15 minutes. Not ideal. 

Once we sat, we ordered by checking off the items on the menu sheet. We ordered the pork soup dumplings, cucumber, hot and sour soup, potstickers, beef tenderloin, garlic string beans, spicy wontons, pork chop fried rice, and chocolate dumplings. 

The food was quite good. The soup dumplings aren't as good as I remembered them. The first batch lacked soup. The second batch was much better but still not my favorite. 

The highlights were the string beans, the wontons, hot and sour soup, beef tenderloin, and chocolate dumplings. The main issue with the food here is that it's served almost like it's coursed out when Chinese food should be eaten all together. So basically we were eating string beans by itself, then the fried rice by itself, and then the beef by itself. When they really should've all came out at once so that I can eat them together.

I'll probably come back but not order the soup dumplings next time.",4,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/V8Uyma8C5swQRRQQxD8xMQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ff133VMOdS9-qzSdCQSJRQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sWckhkpoeJHelwzHVdo9Eg/o.jpg,,Food & Beverage

Din Tai Fung,Brian L.,27/1/2025,"I've been to DinTai Fung before in Taiwan, so I have some frame of reference to which to compare this one. First, this place was massive. You walk downstairs and you immediately see a huge dining area was this kind of fancy date night ambiance. 

You need a reservation to be seated, after checking in it took about 10 min for us to be seated. The wait staff is very kind and they check many things like if you have allergies, what order you want the dishes to come out, etc... The wait time for the food was longer than average, but given how many people were inside I can kind of understand if it takes a bit longer. 

The food itself was pretty standard for Din Tai Fung, which is a bit better than average. Din Tai Fun does the fundamentals really well, they don't really use gimmicks and rely on ingredients and preparation to serve you a good dish. Eating at Din Tai Fun feels clean if that makes sense. 

Everything we ordered was pretty good, the only thing I kind of regretted getting was the chocolate xiao long bao. Don't listen to anyone who tells you this is amazing, do yourself a favor and just buy Nutella and some dumpling wrap.",4,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LytlEFZ90kRBFNYMgOXPfQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/V6n1h9dpwpPf0DesEBtrtQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/I1sES38bhMmDG0HHBGL4GA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/P7Ft5-QNWTys_TNVsUf_qg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MkVxnRXxIQ5SDvwDOBB3aw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oneifFsEX8SuXArIbjQWcQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/W-U8wRTRASwxtcLnU2shQw/o.jpg,Spicy Wonton; Chocolate Xiao Long Bao; Cucumber Salad; Menu; Menu; Pork Xiao Long Bao; Chocolate Xiao Long Bao,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,Anand D.,24/7/2025,"LOVE LOVE LOVE Din Tai Fung! This was my wife and I's first time at the NYC location. We have been to one in London and one in San Francisco as well. We made a reservation for this one ahead of time, and it was a good thing we did, because the place was PACKED. This location is also massive too. There are numerous tables scattered throughout the entire establishment. We get what we normally get at Din Tai Fung. We got the spicy chicken wontons, the noodles w/ spicy sauce, the pork xiao long bao, the string beans, the cucumber salad, and the cucumber salad. Everything tasted SO GOOD. I got a Yuzu Margarita to drink and my wife got a gin and tonic. I ended the dinner with an espresso martini, which was very good. The food at Din Tai Fung is always consistent, no matter what location you go to, which I love. The ambiance of this particular location was really nice too. Low lighting mixed with the hustle and bustle of the business makes this place a great spot for a date night. The only reason why I am not giving this 5 stars, is because the service was very very very slow. I do understand it was busy, but it took 20 minutes for my coke to come out. But our waiter was very nice and did apologize, so no huge deal. I would definitely come back here again!!

Din Tai Fung,Veronica H.,17/1/2025,"Ahhh we meet again my lovely DTF - we've had it in Singapore and LA and have been anxiously waiting for the NYC location to finally open! The biggest one in the world. 

Nomz: We ordered the following for two and it was enough food, one of us eats a good amount and the other a normal amount. Two orders of the pork soup dumplings (I mean we came for these) - I do feel like they were soupier at other locations but the silver lining is that you can just eat it in one bite versus puncturing it and sipping. Yummm. 
Also, ordered the shrimp and pork spicy wontons, delicious. 
Surprise of the night were the green beans, they were so freaking flavorful and addicting, I still think about them sometimes. 

Drinks: Had the cucumber gimlet and it was very nice and refreshing - would order again. 

Service: Was very good, everyone was super attentive and there were a lot of people working there - it's a whole operation. 

Ambiance: It's underground, we were given a pager and had to wait even with a reservation once we got there. The dining room is elegant, on your way to the restroom your will find their classic glass area where you can see them making the famous Xiao Long Bao.

Nope or Dope: Dope, I mean come on - it's an instant classic - can't wait until I go back.",5,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yYpLIKxOhcfBX2UQDn6KzQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wiv71UMoS-9qe02I4mVYXA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pNRM3sh1-odV4S8cCu1Mig/o.jpg,Green beans; Pork soup dumplings; Shrimp and pork wontons,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,Edna L.,10/1/2025,"Having been here 4x now, I can say for sure that the green beans are my favorite from here time and time again! 

Each time I come here I always make sure to have a reservation. It will minimize the wait time. The interior is dark, wooden, lamp-lit kind of vibe. Tables are close together yet far enough apart to have your own space from a different party. 

Food: Once again, I strongly recommend  the green beans! They're crunchy and full of garlic! Flavor is on point! 

My second favorite here has got to be the braised beef noodle soup! But you need to eat it while it's hot otherwise it's not good when warm/cold. It comes in a pretty big portion, would share this. Decent amount of beef and veggies. Also add chili oil to the beef if that's your thing :)

My third favorite are the spicy wontons! I tried the chicken ones and the shrimp/pork ones. The shrimp/pork ones were a little more flavorful and juicier which we absolutely loved and were considering ordering another of but we ended up being too full. 

We've also tried the pork soup dumplings, crab soup dumplings, truffle and kurobuta pork soup dumplings, and the chocolate mochi soup dumplings with a side of sea salt cream to top it off. The pork soup dumplings, though standard, were the best ones here. The truffle one while rich in taste, had too much of a lingering truffle aftertaste for us. A little truffle is good but too much can be overpowering! The chocolate mochi came highly recommended and it was good but at the same time, very sweet! 

Noodles with sesame sauce was good but you quickly get tired of this taste. Recommend putting some hot chili oil on it!  Noodles with Spicy Sauce was good! Very flavorful! Also would recommend the pork fried noodles! 

Would not recommend the cucumber salad (bland), seaweed and bean curd salad, or the pork chop fried rice. The seaweed and bean curd salad is refreshing and good to try since it's somewhat different but wouldn't order again. The pork chop fried rice was also pretty bland. 

Their boba teas are also pretty good! Not as sweet as other vendors but fulfills the craving and good to have with the meal. 

Also at this location only is their black sesame espresso martini which I absolutely loved. Hints of black sesame, stronger espresso taste! Mmm! 

Pricier joint than many but would come back to celebrate or catch up with friends.",5,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ydScI8WZS_nuZV-vEudq6w/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Oy683k8d61mBnB185JbwKQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KYXLXjv-AAO-WGvbY0BW8g/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yRb8_YnRjt42pTRAeOen0Q/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cDtIVB-J1lsCUrufCRE0Pg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KGSxTcY9uqdY5PCZHjV_Vw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BPbGK2mGE3Yl5JZPjZCZ8w/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CsFZnUQ9EvRKT5khSSHTlw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XbSaBAkys7VL0XG2knk6Og/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Suq-eWS6gIK9Og3g9zPlTg/o.jpg,Spicy chicken wontons; Braised beef noodle soup; String beans with garlic; Seaweed and bean curd salad; Black sesame Espresso martini; Crab soup dumplings; Noodles with sesame sauce; Chocolate mochi soup dumplings with a side of sea salt cream; Noodles with spicy sauce; Interior,Food & Beverage

Din Tai Fung,Tameeka B.,2/1/2025,"I first dined at Din Tai Fung shortly after its NYC opening in July, when securing a reservation was nearly impossible, and the hype around it was intense. 

At the time, the food lived up to the buzz with standout dishes like the shrimp wontons, noodles with spicy sauce, and the Sesame & Mochi Xiao Long Bao. 

However, I did find the pork xiao long bao to be just okay,,, the flavor wasn't fully there, and the portions were smaller than expected for the price. Maybe it was due to it being the first week of opening, so I'm definitely open to giving it another try. 

This restaurant is HUGE! You can come with groups, sit at the bar, or even come solo because the space allows it. I really think it's cool you get to see the dumplings being made, it's definitely an experience. 

Now getting a table is much easier with reservations available via here on Yelp or walk-ins.

Din Tai Fung,Vanessa C.,20/7/2025,"I ordered takeout and was excited due to all the positive reviews and reputation that this brand has. I was utterly disappointed. Maybe it would have been better in the restaurant but when I received my pork soup dumplings and rice cakes with shrimp they were lukewarm, borderline cold. The soup dumplings were incredibly small, the smallest I've ever seen at a restaurant (even trader joes box soup dumplings are bigger) but sure at least they give you 10 dumplings in an order. The flavor was relatively bland and there was no depth at all. There was also no sauce so I ate my soup dumplings dry. The rice cakes were ok but also not the best I've had. I paid an incredulous amount for food that was not worth the price and was not filling in the slightest.

My friend and I took advantage of their weekday lunch special (runs from 11:30 am-3:30 pm), which affords you a $16-19 main dish (pho, banh mi, or noodle/rice dish), accompanied by a salad or soup. For a restaurant like this where dinner entrees run for $21-43, this is a fantastic deal. The portions were excellently sized, and our dishes were  really tasty. My friend also got Vietnamese iced coffee and it was giant. They have the full range of beer, wine, fancier cocktails, and a robust list of non-alcoholic options, so there's something for everyone.

-bun cha Hanoi: this reminds me of other Vietnamese vermicelli dishes I've had in the past but the presentation of this dish is cool. It was also fun to construct your own wraps with the veggies, vermicelli, and meat. 
-crab fried rice: a good balance of crab meat and rice, a stable dish that you can't go wrong with. 

All the dishes were super delicious overall with beautiful presentation. Service is quick and attentive.

La Dong,Jenny Z.,28/5/2025,"NYC lacks good vietnamese food... so was super excited to hear that La Dong opened up! While not the best Vietnamese food I have ever had, it is pretty good for NYC standards. Service is super fast and it is also easy to get a last minute res here :) 

- spring rolls (3/5): not super impressed by this. looked better in other photos I saw online (I wish the texture was a bit more like a nest), so maybe today was an off day for this dish. 

- papaya salad (2.5/5): not terrific papaya salad either. I would opt into one of the other salads

- banh mi (4.2/5): this was my favorite dish of the night! they were able to cut it into 4 pieces for the 4 of us and the truffle broth was heavenly. the ingredients inside the banh mi were OK, but the sandwich overall was delectable and the bread was soft and crunchy!

- pho (4/5): pho is also one of the better ones I have had in NYC. The noodles were solid and the broth was really good. Only thing is I wish the meat was a bit soft and tender, and also wish there was option to add tripe!

- cha ca (2.5/5): I have had Cha ca in hanoi before and this did not taste like it. The flavors felt a bit off and did not love how the fish was cooked

La Dong,RJ T.,19/5/2025,"If you're looking for Vietnamese cuisine that hits both the comfort and wow factor, La Dông is it. From the moment we walked in, the space blew us away--warm wooden accents, arched details, and vintage-style lanterns gave it a cozy yet upscale vibe. It somehow feels both like a hidden gem and a trendy destination at the same time.

I ordered the shrimp with sugarcane served alongside a flavorful plum dipping sauce. It was beautifully presented and delicious--the shrimp was tender and savory with a hint of sweetness from the sugarcane, and the plum sauce added the perfect tangy balance.

My friends ordered the bánh mì and a bowl of pho. The bánh mì was generously filled and had that satisfying crunch you hope for in the bread. The pho had a rich, aromatic broth and was topped with fresh herbs and tender cuts of meat--definitely a standout.

Service was friendly and attentive, and even though the place was buzzing, we never felt rushed.

La Dông makes a strong case for being one of the best Vietnamese spots in the city--not just for the food, but for the full experience.

- located near union square park
- making a reservation is recommended as they are were crowded even on a weekday evening
- once seated servers want you to order quickly though are patient if you ask questions about the menu
- ambiance good for a semi casual meal

MENU
- wide selection of Vietnamese classic and special dishes
- some vegetarian and vegan options
- average price ($18 per entree)

FOOD
- tofu mushroom banh mi (5/10): grilled oyster and shimeji mushrooms with shredded carrots and fried tofu in a toasted baguette served with a side of mushroom broth. To make it vegan I asked for the mayo to be removed. The portion is very generous and lasted me two meals. I was underwhelmed by the taste of the filling especially the tofu. A good banh mi for me is one that has a lot of freshness from the herbs and pickles and has a firm tofu that could be marinated for more flavor. This tofu just tasted fried and there was not enough herbs.

La Dong,Veronica L.,19/4/2025,"Nothing special - HONESTLY, the food is good, but it's overpriced, but that's Manhattan culture for you! It also leans more towards ""fusion"", as it's the sister restaurant of Pranakhon + Thai Villa, both of which are Thai restaurants, and you see the fusion in the menu with the option of Crab Fried Rice. 

For apps, I'd rec the Steamed Rice Cakes, which come in a portion of 4 small dishes. The Chicken Wings weren't bad, just quite slim and pretty sweet. We got the Fried Branzino, which comes with a bowl of rice. It looked much easier to eat than the Dill + Turmeric version. It was good, but again, overpriced! 

I'd SKIP the Wagyu Pho - the theatrics where they pour in the broth is pretty much what you pay for, besides the meat, but we also got the regular Beef Pho and they pretty much tasted the same!! These are also supposedly Northern style pho styles, but my Viet friend noted that the broth didn't taste very northern.

Staff is GREAT!

La Dong,Stacy K.,6/4/2025,"I don't eat at a lot of Vietnamese restaurants in NYC so I was really looking forward to trying La Dong. As soon as I stepped in, I could tell this is one of the prettiest restaurants I've ever been to. Everything from the ceilings, to the walls, to the tables were decorated beautifully. To start off, they give you complimentary shrimp chips & paste.  The service from start to finish was impeccable. They took my order pretty quickly and I had little wait time for my drinks/food. They were thoughtful in explaining any dishes I had a question with, they replaced our plates in between appetizers and entrees, and would constantly clean the crumbs or empty plates on our table throughout the night. They also provided wipes for your handed to use as a lot of the appetizers require you to use your hands to make wraps.  

Here is what I ordered:
Sugarcane Shrimp - consistency was like a fish ball (but shrimp...) and the sauce was sweet and tangy 
Crispy Spring Rolls - so crispy and juicy, doesn't look like the authentic spring rolls I've tried at other places but it was so good in it's own way and the cabbage/cilantro balances out the oils
Dry Duck Noodle - never tried this type of dish before (because I normally order pho) but I wanted to try something new, the noodles had flavors I never had before and the duck was CRISPY to perfection on the outside and well flavored/moist on the inside 
Classic Banh Mi - baguette was so crispy and the ingredients inside were so fresh, it comes with a side of truffle soup which complimented it so well and helped wash it down

One of those spots where you can do a casual $20 banh mi/pho meal here or branch out and try a bunch of specials and drinks for $$$. 

Their appetizers were the star of the show. Tried the pomelo salad and the banh xeo. First time trying banh xeo and it was SO GOOD. like a fried omelet taco with fresh veggies and tangy fish sauce! the pomelo salad was also very good, loved the coconut crunch. the fish sauce was overwhelming by itself and the chips were hard to eat with the salad. Also tried the short rib curry which came w half a baguette. Very yummy but a lot of meat. Would definitely
not recommend if you are getting one dish because it is so meat and carb heavy. Meat was tender and came off the bone. $47pp split between two.

Only reason it's not 4-5 stars is because we kept feeling rushed. The waitstaff asked us no less than 5 times if we were done despite me responding with we were still eating/picking each time.

When traditional classics are elevated to next level, we appreciate that food a lot. The best Vegetable Pho ($21) I've ever had, where the broth packs a lot of flavor. The accoutrements consist of some spicy chilies and vinegar garlic which elevate the taste further, and just when you think you have a perfect dish, a spice packed garlic, cilantro hot sauce if what you can request for, if you enjoy spicy food - which goes extremely well with the rice noodles!

The Crab Fried Rice ($32) from the Chefs special menu was amazing too and was a good plate to share between two. This dish accompanies the hot sauce.

They don't do changes or substitutions, so nothing else can be modified to be made vegetarian.

Summer Roll Cara Cara - Loved the flavor added by the cara cara oranges and the peanut sauce was .

Tofu and Mushroom Bánh Mì - Big enough to last two meals and comes with truffle soup. A few too many mushrooms for me, but I loved the tofu and spicy mayo.

La Dong,Jenna I.,17/2/2025,"La Dong is bringing restaurant dining experiences back! Okay, maybe those experiences haven't gone anywhere but either way La Dong is crushing it. 

First there's the charming interior design of the place that has just the right amount of art direction and charm to make you feel like you're somewhere cool. Then there's the details -- like the branded plates and the cozy nooks and the weirdly dark bathrooms. Just more fun little immersive things that nobody bothers to do anymore. 

Then the service is super friendly and prompt, lovely people who are chatty and down to help you decide from all the lovely things on the menu. And then of course there's the menu -- amazing! A great mix of interesting Vietnamese food and recognizable staples, all of it darn delicious. The gigantic sesame rice cracker is a stand out appetizer, as was the tofu scallion and meatballs. Also a fan of the crab fried rice, which is a generously large portion. 

I can't wait to come back and explore the rest of the menu -- maybe next time with a bigger group so we can really taste it all.",5,restaurants; nightlife,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8CdkMzVEArLMcMXh0NbjLw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-x78SrrtfBU9yq2iLIE3FQ/o.jpg,Lunar new year ceiling; Interior,Food & Beverage
La Dong,Melanie W.,15/3/2025,"Vietnamese fusion restaurant. I made a reservation, arrived early, and still needed to wait for my table to be ready. The food was great but not worth the hype. 

Pomelo Salad (Chandler pomelo, grilled shrimp, Cara Cara, lemongrass, Kaffir lime, green moscato grape, mint, shallot & toasted coconut tossed in spicy tamarind dressing) - I should request it not spicy so that it can be more refreshing. The salad does not have much pomelo; it is more toasted coconut.

Crispy Spring Roll (pork, crab, shrimp, wood ear mushroom, carrot stuffed in a Vietnamese net wrapper) - It's not too oily, but I can't tell if there are crab and shrimp since they were well mixed with the pork paste.

Pho Ha Noi ( rice noodles, slow-cooked brisket, raw chuck eye, shallot, scallion, cilantro, side of pickle, garlic, and bird eye chili): The broth had a deep, rich beef flavor. The pho was overpriced for the portion, but the meat quality was definitely better than at other traditional Pho restaurants.",4,restaurants; nightlife,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dnRoFGgVueaLrBztkNJQ2A/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eGN-PsgxI7VDyuB_2Ak3gg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CjKrPBLRaaLmUx0EIyalUg/o.jpg,,Food & Beverage
La Dong,Mia H.,11/3/2025,"Not a bad spot for Vietnamese food, but I would say that it does lean more towards fusion, rather than authentic Vietnamese. The interior of the restaurant is dimly lit, lively, and has trends of traditional Vietnamese decor. Service was friendly and fairly quick.

We ordered the banh beo, the banh xeo, the bun bo hue, the tamarind duck, and avocado ice cream (at the end). At the beginning of your meal, they give you complimentary shrimp chips with a chili sate, which was sweet and savory. The banh beo was pretty good and I would definitely re-order. The banh xeo was a bit of a surprise as it came out in a taco shell, and there weren't any flavors of tumeric or coconut (I was a bit disappointed by this dish). The fish sauce for both dishes were REALLY light so I had to ask for straight fish sauce. The bun bo hue was pretty solid and came with lots of meat. And, my favorite dish of the night was the tamarind duck, which I could eat any day--it was so good.

The items I did try - sugarcane shrimp, ca chien nuoc mam (fried branzino), and dry duck noodle were delicious! People who like sweet sauces will like the sauces here. Everything is very flavorful and plated nicely.

La Dong,Rina D.,8/1/2025,"As soon as I walked in, I was amazed at the vibe of the bar! Your full party needs to be present before you can get seated, but the waiting area is pretty big.

I loved the dark ambiance once I walked in, with the dim lights and highlights with colorful lamps.

It took a bit for someone to come and ask us for water and take our menu. However, the food came out pretty fast! They probably had one of the best summer rolls that I have ever had. The ingredients were fresh, blended well, and they put their own twist with some crunchy thing that was actually so good! Definitely needed more sauce as we were munching away. 

We were originally going to order a regular pho, but the waiter said we MUST get the wagyu pho if it is our first time here, so we were convinced. It definitely was different from the traditional pho as it was lacking a lot of the ingredients, but the broth was very rich and the meat was so tender and good! It was still very yummy. It definitely felt like a premium pho. 

 The Bun Cha Hanoi also seemed like a popular dish so we ordered it, and I was glad to see that there were plenty of veggies and noodles! I do think there should be more meat given this ratio and it was a bit hard to eat, but everything put together was still very yummy. The portion size was definitely generous and good for sharing.

La Dong,Emma P.,5/5/2025,"Fantastic Vietnamese restaurant off Union Square.
The interior is beautifully designed with lots of dark wood and feels authentically SE Asian.
Servers are delightful, very helpful, pleasant and efficient. 
We came for lunch and the food was excellent. We ordered the side add ons as well as the lunch menu items but the portions were so generous we need not have.
What we ate:
Cara Cara Summer Roll. This was light and refreshing. I frequently find the Peanut dipping sauce served with summer rolls to be cloying, this one wasn't. 
Spring Rolls. These were made with some sort of shredded outer wrapper that was crisp and crunchy rather than the usual soy or rice paper. The pork and crab filling was good. Really enjoyed these! 
Salad. Lunch comes with a complimentary small salad. It was great and had a yuzu soy dressing that had a wasabi type heat.
Pork Bahn Mi. Delicious, over stuffed sandwich. The pork was braised and tender and balanced well with the pickled vegetables. I'd order this or one of the other Bahn Mi again for sure.
Lemongrass Chicken over rice. Delicious again. Big portion with plenty of chicken and a fried egg along with nuts and salad. The chicken was tender and flavorsome.
Prices at lunchtime are very reasonable especially given the sizes of the portions. At night the menu is more varied and slightly more expensive.

La Dong,Alan S.,2/1/2025,"For vegetarians, vibrant noodle soups and broths to pass the winter months are often hard to find. In very aesthetic environs near Union Square, La Dong is serving up a very soothing vegan pho with a heavy emphasis on assorted mushrooms for when one feels overwhelmed. A generous portion of green chili and a slice of lime on the side take the broth to the next level of depth.

La Dong,David C.,31/12/2024,"# Overall:
Definitely can recommend giving Ladong a try. I would recommend the classic pho over the wagyu pho. Since it was my first time here, decided to not be too adventurous with the menu, but there is an extensive menu that I intend on exploring more the next time I come back!

# Ambiance
Ladong's is right next to Union Square. From the street, the only indication you're in the right place is a big red sign with their name. Even though their facade is basically large windows, you don't really get a feel for their vibes until you're inside. Everything comes together to give a nice welcome and homely feel.

# Food and Drink
Complimentary Shrimp Crackers
As you decide on your order, you're presented with a few shrimp crackers and some chili sauce to go with them. The shrimp crackers are nice and light. The chili sauce is not spicy but very strong in umami flavor.

Pho Ha Noi
I really enjoyed the pho here. The flavors just seemed to click for me. The broth was nice and hearty. The bird eye chilis were a perfect way to add spice. The pickled garlic added a new flavor profile.

Wagyu Pho
This pho was special in that the server will pour out the broth during serving (as opposed to a normal pho like the Pho Ha Noi). This was my girlfriend's dish and aside from the presentation, she didn't really feel that this pho was that much different from the Pho Ha Noi. 

Pork Banh mi
Decided to order this instead of an appetizer since I heard about dipping the banh mi into the provided soup. The banh mi itself is a decent size, and while not the best banh mi I've ever had, it feels like a different dish with the dip soup. The banh mi itself still tasted good, but maybe could've gone without the mayo.",5,restaurants; nightlife,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oIZ2a3C2hkMp0Dbrzlb3ig/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8C-3-Xon5GigZXujQX5mLA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yfrjbrxTxjtactIL52ppvg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ogI4Y5QVtEOun5mqsZIvzw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3qqkfnh5tUhyClTD2T6raQ/o.jpg,Pho Ha Noi; Shrimp Crackers with Chili; Menu; Menu; Pork Banh Mi and Wagyu pho,Food & Beverage

Got the lunch special pho Ha Noi with a salad. Salad was pretty small, but tasted fine with the citrus-y dressing. Pho itself was also fine. Nothing to write home about. I did find it interesting they served it with pickled garlic and peppers instead of sriracha and oyster sauce. Either way, the broth was clean enough although maybe felt like it might've been heavy on MSG. Noodles were slightly thicker rice noodles. Heavy on the green onions which I like.

Overall, it was a fine lunch spot. Service was quick and friendly and interior is nice too.

I'm very easy eating so every food we order here are no meat dishes. We start with.....

- Vegetable summer roll: it is ok, I'm not crazy about the dipping sauce so our server gives me a seafood sauce (which spicier but my friend couldn't eat it because it has fish sauce inside)

- Sauteed morning glory: also good but a bit salty, probably have to eat with rice but we just have it as a appetizer.

La Dong,Christine C.,10/1/2025,"I came here twice:
1st time was for lunch on a weekend. We had an amazing appetizer which is chips where you can dip in their sambal. I really enjoyed it. We then had pho. I had the regular one and my partner had the Wagyu pho. It is certainly not Houston pho and I am not sure if it is viet pho. It does have northern pho roots. But overall I still greatly enjoyed it. I think one might need to not picture it or compare it to Houston or viet pho. Overall still a very great bowl of noodles. Slightly pricey though so def something one can try once.

For lunch special on a weekday, I thought it was priced well. What I also liked was I was able to had an appetizer add on. Normally you would have to order a whole appetizer and would require a few more people in a group to try more of the items. But for a fraction of the price I can simple get a taste of what apps they offer which I really appreciate. So def take advantage of the weekday lunch specials and ordering the add ons. The pho ga was good, def good chicken and very standard and good pho ga. Zero complaints. I personally really liked the dry pho. My only complaint is that it was too big and too much beef? (If that is even a complaint). After a salad or a soup, I really couldn't finish the dry pho. It may look rather small but when eating it felt pretty hefty. It's more like a Lo mein so it isn't completely dry. But I really liked the soy sauce mixture.

So overall def recommend la dong, just don't expect it to be like your average viet spot. Think of it as a fusion spot and you would really appreciate the little hints of changes and differences.",5,restaurants; nightlife,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fZbt5Us11BJlyUzRAk3pwA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kv6eGw33nPTpoGqsBhYyXA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dHaS42ajS4gMVwQOMlWFGQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/a4LllNdBP4H5qA7B1MYE5Q/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lySaTJoMeiQqBnRcqJVXNg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-uXxoEfGItoyok_A15IYFA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fPgdkOpDXNQbBu1vBpgjWQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/E5tylStebzNtAPG8MO2XJA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/h4ZKrIRObijixF1FqFM0SA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/t0w2m7llS5R_PAHzQu8bYg/o.jpg,"Appetizer chips for lunch on weekend; Drinks menu; Wagyu pho; Lunch special side soup; Menu; Lunch special: extra add on rice cakes; Lunch special side salad.

The inside is super spacious and there are plenty of seats. I went as a group of 4 and our food came out fairly quickly after we ordered. 
The star of the show are definitely appetizers. From the complimentary crackers to the sugarcane shrimp, rice cakes and the papaya salad with chicken skin, the appetizers are so unique and delicious. We were quite full after all the appetizers! Their main entrees like the pho ha noi or the bun cha hanoi are good but nothing spectacular. The pho noodles were a bit thicker than normal and the broth was decent.

La Dong,Peter D.,21/10/2024,"I'm pretty sure I've written previously that I actually don't care about the decor of a restaurant, as I'm more interested in the food. Well, La Dong made me care. It's freaking beautiful in here. Whoever designed this place deserves some sort of award. The ceiling of umbrellas is an amazing touch, and I love that mural up front as well.

Luckily the food is excellent as well.*

We shared a number of starters, and while they were beautiful and tasty (banh xeo!), the complimentary shrimp chips and the mains were the standouts for me. Namely:

1. The Ca Ri Hai San Ca, a seafood and egg curry concoction that had us wanting to lick the plate, and  

2. The Chien Nuoc Mam, a deboned branzino that was fried and sauced to perfection. It's served with the skeleton curled the plate like the serpent Jörmungandr, except instead of being curled around the world, it was curled around the most delicious chunks of fish you've ever tasted. 

Enjoy.

*You should be aware that the food may not necessarily be ""authentic"" Vietnamese food. However, I think these complaints should largely be ignored, as (1) food is not static; it is ever-evolving, and the heavy French influence on Vietnamese cuisine should have you questioning what specific point in history do you want current food to emulate? Also, (2) if the food here at La Dong was ""authentic"" no doubt people would be complaining about the prices and how they could get the same thing for less elsewhere.",5,restaurants; nightlife,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/foHH7EGyj7Xgbl1z-McLIA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/16jMADDO6jbLqrVNVHDuaw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AkXzf4peluWlEZ82OpGAng/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dWBgn_DXFBvxR-tmV6wlJg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/r9XyjUHOHp_AAqbD8PpiDA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/COddQtFa-dNWXuzuVSzvzg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-exYGI4ChRTbyn3MSUR2qQ/o.jpg,Whole Branzino; Amazing ceiling; Complimentary chips; Finished fish; Curry; Bathroom; Banh xeo,Food & Beverage
La Dong,Eric K.,9/11/2024,"La Dong is a new Vietnamese fusion restaurant opened by the team behind Thai Villa, which I am a big fan of. I had the opportunity to dine here with a friend recently and was overall a bit disappointed.

We got to try the steamed rice cake and pho. The steamed rice cake had a nice presentation but was served lukewarm and was a bit tough to eat. Overall, it wasn't my favorite thing and I wish I tried the spring or summer rolls instead. The pho had a nice, flavorful broth but I honestly think the local Vietnamese restaurant around the block from my apartment is similar in quality and significantly cheaper. It just wasn't very memorable and I preferred having the more traditional sides and fixings. Where were my bean sprouts?!

The restaurant is beautiful and the vibes were on point, as expected by the group behind Thai Villa. Service was quick but attentive and polite. Overall, it wasn't bad but I guess I wanted a more authentic experience. Maybe I ordered the wrong things but I am willing to go back and try it again.",3,restaurants; nightlife,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7HkQuM8k56Dfu8f4W6X53w/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Rz9FyYzfkZN5nydsFdK9HQ/o.jpg,,Food & Beverage
La Dong,Rosanna N.,26/12/2024,"The service was nice but the restaurant is quite crowded. It was very hard to sit in our booth or even get out of it. If you are able to get a seat, I would recommend asking for the middle table. 

1. Sugarcane Shrimp (8/10): Good sauce, flavor was good, would get again
2. Morning Glory (8/10): Delicious but so small and not worth the price
3. Bun Cha Hanoi (8/10): Hard to eat, not much meat and hard to share
4. Manila Clams (mussels) (5/10): They ran out of clams and substituted it with mussels but it was not fresh at all and did not taste very good. Flavor is also super bland
5. Wagyu Pho (10/10): Super clean, not heavy, probably my favorite thing there that gave this a higher rating. Would definitely go back for 
6. Crab Fried Rice (8/10): It was fine, very standard, had good amounts of crab 

I was not very impressed by the drinks but it is a cute place for dinner. I was also sad that there wasn't much dessert on the menu. I would definitely come back to try the banh mi and more pho next time.",4,restaurants; nightlife,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3fjz0Gvv1phS2iKsiFmMBg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1tP7uO4d97g6YabvoqB7GQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/78kmpr_Li4ABuo9n7-FQ3w/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ODHWAzvi6o5xIK_3k3zwaw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kN_EMzQC3hF6ehU_6CEtcQ/o.jpg,Bun Cha Hanoi; Crab Fried Rice; Manila clam; Wagyu Pho; Sugarcane Shrimp,Food & Beverage
La Dong,JT T.,3/11/2024,"Food:

Waygu Pho 3/5 - I get that the price point is based on the meat but no bowl of pho should cost $34.  Note that this is the pho in general is the Northern Vietnam style so you won't get the same condiments as you're used to.   Pho was good but not for that price

Bo luc lac (shaking beef) 4/5 - great flavor and also overly priced, but they're using Waygu steak so I guess it's expected

Crispy spring roll 2.5/5 - not what I expected but it's got a much different wrap on it.   Some kind of flaky outer shell.  I also don't love when a Vietnamese restaurant uses the words summer and spring rolls incorrectly.   We only use spring rolls and egg rolls if you want to be legit

Ambiance - 5/5 for the vibe and feel of the restaurant

Service 5/5 - waitress was prompt with taking our orders and checking up on us

La Dong,Katarina L.,8/10/2024,"Vibes & ambiance? Check and Check! Prepare to be wowed the second you walk in the door. This restaurant is from the same team behind Thai Villa which will become clear right away. It is beautiful, so cozy and you'll feel like you are walking into a very special space. Honestly even the bathrooms were gorgeous...

The food is also noteworthy, don't worry. They started us with complimentary fish chips, and our first app of the night were the Banh Beo (steamed rice cake). It's served in four small dishes that you add a little sauce to and dig in. It was tasty! Next were the banh xeo (Vietnamese tumeric crepe). Also very tasty but it was served on a waffle cone ish sort of taco shell. I loved the filling of shrimp, shallots and beansprouts. Next time I visit, I would pass on ordering those two dishes again. 

Onto the things I LOVED. One of my favorites of the meal was the Ca Ri Hai San (stir fried seafood & egg). The sauce was so flavorful and cream, I couldn't get enough of it over rice. And oh man, the seafood bites mixed in were delicious. 

If you are looking for the perfect thing to share with the table and you love seafood as much as me, get the Ca Chien Nuoc Mam (fried deboned whole branzino)! There was another whole branzino on the menu but we went with this was basically because no one was up for deboning a shared fish. It was truly SO good and I can't recommend it enough. 

We needed a little bit of green on the table so we got the morning glory veggies as the perfect fresh bite.

La Dong,Michelle T.,7/6/2025,"We were planning a cousins' dinner and one of my cousins recommended La Dong. She had been there before and vouched for the food. We had a 6:00pm reservation, but two of us ended up being a bit late. They were still able to sit us, but warned that they would start the 1.5 hour dining time at the point they sat us, regardless of when our last person arrived. This was fine with us, as we were the ones who were late. 

We ended up splitting everything, so here's a giant list of all the food that we ordered for 4 people: 
- Steamed Rice Cakes with shrimp, dried shrimp, scallion oil, shallot, garlic & Vietnamese dipping sauce
- Nem Nướng, or grilled meatballs, served in red leaf lettuce wrap,
Cara Cara orange, ginger, cucumber, toasted coconut, shallot & peanut sauce
- Pâté & Bone: chicken liver mousse, pickle, bone marrow & toasted baguette
- Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio with *rare* American wagyu slices, fresh lime, shrimp paste, watercress, Vietnamese coriander, peanut, crispy shallots & bird's eye chili
- Cá Chiên Nước Mắm: fried whole Branzino (de-boned) tossed in sweet fish sauce glaze, fresh greens & herbs
- Shaking Beef: wok tossed American Wagyu cubes, onion, yellow pepper in garlic soy (served medium-rare) & watercress-cilantro salad
- Cà Ri Sườn Bò, or beef short rib curry: tender braised short ribs in Vietnamese yellow curry, baby carrot & coconut milk
served with baguette. creamy, spicy & fragrant
- Classic Banh Mi with homemade pork sausage, ground pork spread, chicken pâté, fresh herbs, pickle & Vietnamese mayo

Ok, perhaps our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. But it was so good. 

My favorites out of the appetizers were the Steamed Rice Cakes and the Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio. The beef carpaccio was super fresh and I loved the mixture of sauce that was layered on top of the carpaccio. It gave the beef such a fresh, crisp flavor. Out of the entrees, I would say the banh mi and the beef short rib curry were my favorites. I'm a sucker for a good coconut milk curry and this one did not disappoint. It was so flagrant and flavorful. 

Service was great and our waitress was super friendly. 

And perhaps this is more my fault than anything, for not asking, because you always have to ask for the price when it comes to specials. But I did order our waitress's recommendation for a drink and it ended up being $43 for essentially a penicillin with special whiskey.

I started with their  shrimp crackers with a delicious sauce that had a bit of a tiny kick.  Then I moved into their signature beef pho with bone marrow add on and boy was it the star of the show.  I didn't think they added anything to the bone marrow, but they didn't need to anyway because it was already so fatty, gelatinous, rich, and dreamy on its own, I'm still salivating thinking of it.  The pho appeared to be topped with maybe fried shallots and there was a side of pickled garlic along with a side of chilies. rice noodle, slow cooked brisket, raw chuck eye, shallot, scallion, cilantro,
side of pickle garlic & bird eye chili.  Yum.

La Dong,Natalie C.,18/11/2024,"More like 3.5 stars but rounding down. Opened by the same team as Thai Villa, the interior is beautiful! The servers were attentive and very sweet, better than Thai Villa for sure. The food was a bit hit or miss for us. We had the steamed rice cake and crispy spring rolls to start. I enjoyed both apps. The entrees were a bit medicore- we had the seafood yellow curry and wagyu pho. The pho broth wasn't as fragrant and rich as I usually like, but the wagyu slices and noodles were good. I wouldn't recommend the seafood yellow curry, the seafood was all extremely fishy and tasted very defrosted. The yellow curry itself was spicy yet sweet and I liked that, but the fishy seafood took away from the curry. 
Overall, not terrible but I heard such great things, I thought it would be better!",3,restaurants; nightlife,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gOnigX4p4Pgpf7ZgUh9UGQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/60N_1NOiSMH5E8fexUxxiA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/COuA_w97EKxO5fUwfRoj5w/o.jpg,,Food & Beverage
La Dong,Cece L.,18/11/2024,"Pretty solid but can be hit or miss depending on what you get.

Banh beo (steamed rice cake): 3/5, really thick which was not my favorite, but the shrimp was cooked well and I liked the toppings. I've just never had such a thick banh beo before.

Nem nuong: 3/5, I preferred this with just fish sauce rather than the peanut sauce it came with. The orange slice was a unique touch that made it feel more fusion-y. I didn't prefer it, but can see some liking it.

Bun cha: 5/5, loved the meat and egg roll and the fish sauce that comes with pieces of pork inside. A solid serving size with the lettuce wraps and vermicelli.

Crispy spring rolls: 5/5, other reviews said it lacked flavor but I loved it. We actually ordered this at the very end since we liked the roll in the bun cha so much. Fun texture with the netting wrap -- a little on the breadier side but still great.

Great service, great ambiance (although there seemed to be a draft at one of the tables since a few parties sat and then asked to be moved). Also, we didn't get any complimentary shrimp chips which I saw in a few reviews.

At the price point, I don't need to come back but I'd be open to.",4,restaurants; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage
La Dong,Josephine L.,25/9/2024,"Let's start with the obvious: Nothing in Manhattan (outside of Chinatown and maybe Curry Hill) is authentic to its original culinary culture anymore. If you plucked a native resident from a country like, say, Thailand and plopped them in the middle of a popular Thai restaurant in this borough, they'd cringe at the Westernization of the menu items, then cry at the prices of the items being 10x what they'd pay back home.

We don't have authentic cuisine in Manhattan, just fusion and ""elevated"". It's the only way restaurants can get away with charging the prices they do. And it gives them cover when they're inevitably criticized for authenticity by being able to say it's just ""inspired"" or ""interpreted"" or ""reimagined"" or some other marketing euphemism for ""not trying to be authentic"". You know what I'm talking about.

La Dong isn't authentic Vietnamese food, let alone authentic Vietnamese street food. It serves ""elevated"" versions of street food classics in pretty presentations in beautiful rooms with stunning decor--which no doubt pleases the clientele that skews heavily, heavily white.

The Banh Beo was the best of what we tried, as the fish sauce was on point and the rice flour was the right texture. 

On the other hand, the Banh Xeo was a colossal disappointment. I won't even get into how wrong it is to harden and waffle-ize the wrap into a taco shell (semi-points for being creative, I suppose) because that crime kind of speaks for itself. It was the filling that was felonious. Where were all the veggies and herbs? Why was it so bland? And why was each banh xeo so...effing...SMALL???

For entrees, we figured we might as well check out the classic Pho Ha Noi because if you can't get pho right, why are you even here? The broth was quite umami, and the beef--cooked two ways--was well done. But I couldn't get over the lack of fresh herbs. Where was the basil? Where was the lemongrass? Garlic and chili peppers on the SIDE and not stewing in the stock where they belong? What newfangled devilry is this, at $21 a bowl?

The only reason I'm not ruling out a return visit is that the prices weren't as shockingly high as other upscale-ified Asian restaurants in Manhattan. But my quest for real Vietnamese food in the borough continues, though at this point, it's starting to feel like the quest will end as disappointingly as season 8 of Game of Thrones.",3,restaurants; nightlife,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FtWm_o8kIbzIdA7qyp6TOA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4MlSPUQbTb6TS67DfzfZcw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SqSzi7ZOu8f3PCV-WA5cFQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ane7tXObnTGB82j718TD6Q/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/J7f6h4tjollAGH3aRY9W1g/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tzS1ckv8Fuj-yAQlktQlNg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LAgXqZOPt7oWVUlCly_7Qg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/epTjQC55-lvOZ1G79LLWnQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IFUdy9hFFUaksjIYoLZC9Q/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DKfeIOgHeLeJEZvZLVMgSw/o.jpg,Drink menu; Food menu 2; Food menu; Pho Ha Noi; Banh Beo; Complimentary homemade prawn chips and fish sauce; Banh Xeo,Food & Beverage
La Dong,Kat C.,9/11/2024,"After seeing La Dong all over my social media, I was super eager to visit and see what all the hype was about. For starters, the interior of the restaurant is absolutely stunning. Throughout the restaurant, the ceiling is covered in umbrellas and gorgeous lotus flower lights, which are absolutely breathtaking. I came here on a Friday night with my boyfriend at around 5:30 and was able to be seated immediately! Here's what we ordered: 

Pho Ha Noi: (3.5/5) Although the broth was pretty flavorful and fragrant, the addition of the crispy onions became overpowering, making it taste almost like a French onion soup. Definitely not my favorite bowl of pho in NYC; however, it was still delicious! 

Pork Banh Mi: (3.5/5) The fact that every banh mi is accompanied by a side of truffle pho for dipping is INCREDIBLE. I wish every restaurant did this!! However, although the idea is amazing, the execution fell a bit flat. The pork itself felt dry and lacking in charred flavor despite the abundance of grill marks on the meat itself. Additionally, the truffle pho broth felt very one-dimensional and overly salty. 

Overall, our meal at La Dong felt just okay. While everything was tasty, I wasn't blown out of the park, and I definitely have other Vietnamese restaurants I'd gravitate toward instead. Good to try, but I don't know if I'd return.",3,restaurants; nightlife,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/G7bjdrxHkbIwI8aXx8SYsA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/T2RTKJR43pXy6WJS2ehHxQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qzqcMTX2dfdo8RJG72_NeA/o.jpg,Pho Ha Noi; Pork Banh Mi; Interior,Food & Beverage

The short rib was so tender it fell apart at the touch. All of the ingredients in the curry were cooked very well. The baguette it came with for dipping was definitely baked in house.

La Dong is a great new Vietnamese restaurant in Union Square. 

The beef pho was very good. The broth was rich, flavorful, and salty. The toppings already come included in the soup, which makes it even more flavorful. The portion size is reasonable - not too big and not too small.

The Bahn Mi was the stand out dish of the evening. The bread was lightly crispy on the outside, and soft and warm on the inside! I've never had a Bahn Mi with warm bread in NYC. All of the vegetables inside the Bahn Mi were incredibly fresh and crisp. It had the right amount of pork and pate.

Some of the other dishes being served around me had a beautiful presentation and I'm looking forward to trying them next time.

The ambience of the restaurant is nice - it has a trendy and modern Vietnamese feel. The service was good.",4,restaurants; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage
La Dong,Nancy N.,3/11/2024,"New to the neighborhood, this Northern Vietnamese spot brings an authentic taste with a modern twist in both food and decor. The design is charmingly Vietnamese yet contemporary--rattan lotus-shaped light fixtures add a beautiful touch! Nina our server is the sweetest! Overall service is swift, friendly, and accommodating for families with young kids, though still ironing out a few kinks due to the new opening. 

The menu offers a great variety of Vietnamese classics and northern specialties. The Pho Hanoi is delicious, especially with the fried dough, though the broth could use a bit more depth to really bring out those savory notes. The Banh Beo rice cakes were a highlight--perfectly chewy with crispy toppings, shrimp, and fish sauce creating that ideal balance. The grilled meatball is served like a taco in a lettuce cup. Quite the unique twist, with refreshing Cara Cara orange for a hint of zest.

Don't skip the mocktails! The Mock Mock Gee, a G&T-style mocktail, is phenomenal. Also the Mangarita packs lot of heat, beware! And if you love turmeric and spice, try the Cha Ca--hearty and flavorful, though a little extra scallion and dill would have perfected it.

Dessert was a simple yet satisfying end: avocado ice cream with banana crunch and jackfruit.

Service here is great, our server was helpful in navigating the menu and was attentive throughout the meal. No complaints!

The food here is pretty solid. My favorite was the pho, which I thought to be one of the better renditions in a city that doesn't have a ton of great pho. The broth was flavorful and fragrant, though don't expect huge portion sizes here. The bun cha was pretty solid, an above average take of the dish, though I'd say the flavors were a bit muted.

La Dong,Koreen D.,21/10/2024,"It's hard to find a good Vietnamese joint in NYC (weird but true), so when La Dong opened, immediately knew I wanted to check it out. 

The menu had a lot of great options. Opted to get:
1. Water spinach: pretty good. Small though
2. Shaking beef: it was alright. I've had better elsewhere. The cilantro salad on the side was pretty bomb though. 
3. Bun cha: pretty good. 

Overall, the food in La Dong was pretty good, albeit servings were on the smaller side. Kinda pricey for the size of the servings. Would come back to check out the other food. 

Ambience was nice. Definitely a nicer Viet joint vs the others. Service was good. Tables were a bit cramped together to make the most of the space.

Even though they touted La Dong as modern Vietnamese, the food itself wasn't thaaat modern or different - probably the ambience vs anything.

La Dong,Dora H.,13/2/2025,"This is currently my favourite restaurant of this year. Yes this place is fusion, yes it is elevated Vietnamese food, and yes it is more expensive than your typical Vietnamese restaurant, but it executes with skill so that each component is thoughtfully prepared with precision, ensuring that flavors are balanced and textures perfected - at least that's the case for my Bun Bo Hue dish. We usually go for hole in the wall, unassuming Vietnamese restaurants bc those usually have the best flavours, but at La Dong not only is the food delicious, but the décor is just absolutely gorgeous and such a vibe. 

I've been ordering Bun Bo Hue at all the restaurants that serve it, even at the Vietnamese restaurants in Philly and if you love Vietnamese food you know Philly is supposed to have amazing Vietnamese restaurants, but nothing has really hit the mark for this specific dish except for La Dong. The soup was flavourful, the meat was fresh and tender, and the noodles were cooked to the perfect texture. Every component of this dish was done perfectly here, while at other restaurants either the noodle texture wasn't great, or the pork hock wasn't tender enough, flavoured enough, or fresh enough...etc. 

The two sides that we tried were the morning glory and the crispy fried tofu scallion - we loved both and would recommend both. The tofu was velvety soft on the inside - I loved the texture and I also loved the flavour. 

I'm seeing a lot of reviews saying the pho was not very good, I feel like part of the negative response is probably due to the price point, however I personally have not tried the soup pho so I can't say. I did try a bit of the dry pho and it's a creative take on pho for those not feeling for hot soup. I liked the flavouring even though it is on the saltier side. The sauce used in it centers around the oyster dipping sauce that is served at all traditional pho restaurants. 

I really enjoyed this place. Our waitress was also super friendly and made us feel very welcomed.",5,restaurants; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage

They start out by giving you light crisps to dip into chili paste. We got the Vietnamese crêpe, which was basically like a taco or waffle cone wrap. The only downside was that it fell apart in our hand because of the crunch. 

The shaking beef was delicious and had a very good sauce. The grilled pork and dipping noodle was yummy as well. The winner here for me was dipping the vermicelli in the fish oil.

La Dong,Ian M.,7/3/2025,"I dined at La Dong with two friends. One lives nearby. He recommended it based on having walked by many a time. He had a flight the next day, and, as a nervous traveler, he didn't wish to be out too far from home. The other two of us had to travel to the venue. I can say it was not a trip I regretted. (I actually took a rental bike there from a prior appointment. That was exhilarating and generated an appetite.)
This establishment exemplifies a new trend of Asian restaurants moving upmarket. Scholars have studied the price points and popular perceptions of different ethnic cuisines. Some such as French, or an outlier among Asian offerings, Japanese, can command premiums with the public, while others such as Chinese and likely Vietnamese have been historically associated with more affordable niches. As much as the change is to be welcomed for the symbolism as to respect for the communities from which the food originated, it also means that the diner will be charged more. In this instance, however, the menu listings were not outrageous, and, more importantly, were worth the charge. The ambiance suggests fancier. The service, likewise. 
We shared two starters. One was the pate and bone marrow. The other was the morning glory. Each was flavorful in its own manner. The former was generous compared to the same item elsewhere. The latter was fresh and well seasoned, a necessary green to accompany the otherwise heavier entrees.
Our party had, respectively, a classic banh mi, a beef main course, and mussels in the appetizer size. Everyone enjoyed their choice. The banh mi was enough for leftovers. The beef looked great. The mussels were the smaller species, in a southeast Asian inflected broth. For dessert, despite my own interest in sampling the avocado ice cream, we settled on a more plain vanilla, albeit accompanied by either giant boba or whatever the proper term is for such tapioca, and a cookie that had subtle complex spices in the mixture. 
We were leisurely. Nobody rushed us. The tab was reasonable. Everyone surrounding us seemed to be similarly enjoying a night out on the town. I am accordingly pleased to commend the establishment. It would be well suited to a first date or a larger gathering. Kudos to the proprietors. They have struck the best balance.",5,restaurants; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage

Crab fried rice was so good I took an extra order to go! We shared the regular pho, which was very good. They give different condiments than the basil, sprouts, and like. They gave a tray with a few different sauces. 
We shared a pot of the secret garden tea, it was very floral and fragrant - sometimes floral teas are a bit bland but not this one, definitely can taste the rose and lavender.

La Dong,Sydney C.,23/2/2025,"The restaurant transports you to south east Asia, or at least a glorified Hollywood version of it. Very cool vibes and very instagramable.
As for the food, we started with the crispy spring rolls and summer rolls, both with shrimp. The summer rolls held together perfectly in the usual rice paper wrap. The veggies were fresh and the shrimp was well cooked. Overall, what you would expect at a Vietnamese restaurant but double the price. The crispy spring rolls were excellent. They are wrapped in a net wrap, which is so much better IMO than the regular wrap. The filling was delicious, but nothing special. Lastly, for appetizers, we got the bone marrow. What a decadent dish. The fat from the bone marrow with a lob of pate work perfectly over a well toasted baguette. 
Now for the mains. The broth for the pho is incredible. I drank it up, which I probably shouldn't have - I assume it goes way over the daily recommended salt consumption. We got the pho with the wagyu. Super tender beef. Does not come with the usual Hoisin and sriracha sauce, but you don't need it. I kind of also miss the other accompaniments - beef balls, tendon, tripe. Overall, the quality of the noodles and broth were excellent.
Next came the duck tamarind. The sauce was so savory - I poured it over a bed of rice and went to town with it.
We got a grilled branzino, which came with lettuce and rice noodle - we wrapped it all together in the lettuce and dipped it in a citrus spiced sauce; flavors all worked incredibly well. Lastly, we got the crab fried rice. I didn't get to try any - was too full from the above - but my son thoroughly enjoyed it.
Service was excellent - attentive and helpful in assisting us in navigating the menu.

La Dong,Mark L.,6/2/2025,"I'm in NYC for a long weekend to see family, and my son and his girlfriend suggested La Dong tonight for dinner. Excellent choice!

This was my first visit, and the Nem Nuong, Bún Cha Hanoi, Shaking Beef (Bò Lúc Lac), and Duck Tamarind was absolutely delicious.

We didn't have a reservation but only had to wait about 30 minutes for a table. The attention paid us before and during dinner was terrific...very attentive. 

The vibe was very upbeat and very relaxed with a ""packed house"" enjoying the experience.",5,restaurants; nightlife,,,Food & Beverage
La Dong,Glenn C.,16/12/2024,"I was here at this unique Vietnamese restaurant earlier in the day with a group of six others. The food here is Vietnamese but elevated so don't exactly expect as traditional grub and the prices are slightly because of this and also because of the nice space. They have two sides of the menu including chef specialties and more traditional dishes though it's hard to say one side was that traditional when there is a $35 pho (nope.) Speaking of the nice space, the restaurant is honestly gorgeous and one of the better decorated restaurants from the mural in front to the paper lanterns above our seat which unfortunately had some red lighting so many of my photos came out a bit poorly. The staff here was pretty friendly but faulty as they forgot to bring out serving spoons occasionally and they brought out food extremely quickly especially for the main dishes which is very reminiscent of their other restaurant Pranakhon and Thai Villa. 

I started with a Calamansi Matcha Spritz which was very much calamansi forward with barely a hint of matcha but it was refreshing and worked throughout the meal and was only $7. I probably would instead get a hot Vietnamese coffee/cà phê sữa nóng next time instead of this or the iced version as it looked excellent on other tables. They gave us some crackers which had a dipping paste in the middle as a freebie to begin. The crackers were presumably tapioca only though they could have probably been shrimp/prawn crackers and had a good crunch while the dipping sauce was outstanding. It had some fish sauce flavor to it, a good amount of chili, and some sweetness but not too much so. It reminded me a little bit of a mixture of belacan and sambal or something equivalent and I honestly would buy a bottle from them as would one of the other people I ate dinner with.

Our only appetizer was the Steamed Rice Cake/Bánh Bèo with shrimp, dried shrimp, scallion oil, shallot, garlic & Vietnamese dipping sauce. They gave us some spoons to eat this with. The rice cakes had a slight coconut flavor to them and there was a little bit of plump shrimp. The dish came with four pieces and it was pretty worth it but I have preferred this from other spots.

Best of the main dishes was definitely the Fried Whole Branzino/Cá Chiên Nước Mắm listed as de-boned (branzino) tossed in sweet fish sauce glaze (with) fresh greens & herbs. The dish was presented nicely with the remaining skeleton of the fish on the platter with all of the pieces around the body of the fish with the herbs on the side. The fish was fried perfectly and they clearly got off almost all the fish that they could with only a tad bit of fish near the fin that could be munched on. The fish sauce had light sweetness and it was nice to make wraps with the fresh greens.

The Crab Fried Rice/Cơm Chiên Cua with white lump crab meat, scallion, egg, and jasmine rice was surprisingly good. I'm usually not someone who orders crab fried rice as I tend to find it most restaurants skimp on the crab but this place definitely did not. The rice was well seasoned and there was also a spicy green sauce on the side to add extra flavor. As someone who usually wouldn't recommend this dish, this is an excellent version here.

The Dry Pho Duck with egg noodle, crispy quarter duck, water spinach, shallot, scallion, cilantro, pickled ginger & duck essence gravy was also solid. The egg noodles were nice and the duck while small was crispy. This had a rich tasty sauce and the pickled ginger was a bit unexpected. I would recommend this as a meal for one.

The Duck Tamarind with crispy roasted half duck, tamarind and duck bone reduction, and steamed Ong Choy was pretty tasty. The tamarind sauce was thankfully not too sweet and the duck piece I had was tender. The ong choy/ water spinach was a good choice of vegetable and surprisingly there were a few slices of I believe pomelo on top also which was a fun touch. This was also a tasty duck dish and while I preferred the dry pho, this had more duck.

The Shaking Beef/Bò Lúc Lắc listed as wok tossed American Wagyu cubes (served medium-rare,) with onion and yellow pepper in garlic soy with a watercress-cilantro salad was the weakest dish by a good amount. The meat was very tender but the sauce was a bit lighter than some other places. I have also preferred thicker chunks of meat from some other fancier Vietnamese spots such as the also recently opened Twin Tails in Columbus Circle as they added more texture and there could have been a lot more grilled onions also. 

The flavors here are a tad light even for Vietnamese food but they have some creative fun options here. Particularly good fried branzino and crab fried rice and the duck dishes were not too shabby either. I would go back and likely get a bahn mi even if it pains me at that price point or try one of their other dishes. There's better spots but for fancy places, it is at least better than Madame Vo and the space is wonderful.

La Dong,Tina L.,29/7/2025,"We got the pomelo salad, papaya salad, and the bun cha hanoi, a dish of meatballs in a garlicky broth that you eat in lettuce wraps (w/ vermacelli, basil, cabbage, and other herbs). Our server Nina, was a sweetheart to tell us that we could order more if we wanted later because the bun cha hanoi would be huge. She was right in that it ended up being the perfect portion. I thought the food we had was delish but had to knock off half a star because the pomelo salad was really sweet.

La Dong,Uyen N.,25/1/2025,"Their pho is actually not bad, but it is a bit too salty. We ordered the wagyu one so maybe that explains why the broth was also a lot more fatty than normal. Also pouring broth from a kettle to the bowl means that the broth is not as hot as it can be, which sucks. The bone marrow and pate is fun to eat and taste pretty good. Bánh bèo is quite hard, not recommended at all. The sauce for bánh đa is pretty good, like sweet and peanut-y; but there supposed to be pork floss in it but we didn 't taste anything. It's a fun dish to eat, but quite expensive for just 1 rice cracker and sauce.

La Dong,Lakshmi L.,25/1/2025,"I haven't been through the reviews to see why La Dong isn't five stars but it gets one from me! La Dong is 5/5 for location, service and food. It is a short walk from union square on 17th street and you are greeted by warm, welcoming hosts immediately. We were dining early on a Friday night so we got a table right away. The place filled up very quickly soon after so I'd imagine there is a wait if you were to come in later. 
We got 2 pho's, one beef, one chicken, a crab fried rice, a Vietnamese coffee and a coconut ice cream for dessert. The staff was kind, gracious and treated us like we were royals. Almost like we were doing them a favor by letting them feed us. The beef pho was superior to the chicken pho, although they both hit the spot on a cold night. The crab fried rice is phenomenal, the rice melts in your mouth, and the flavors do a number on your senses. Washed it all down with a Vietnamese iced coffee which was just the right amount of sweet. It had a malty texture, remarkably close to a bitter dark chocolate milkshake. The coconut ice cream is how coconut ice cream should be, all the time, everywhere. Topped with dry coconut shavings, jelly and a dehydrated banana leather, it was simple and elevated, all in one go. Also, the food comes out fast and they start you off with complementary shrimp crackers.

They also provided complementary shrimp crackers and chili sauce - the chili was really fragrant and paired well with the dishes too! I ordered the Bun Cha Hanoi and it was plated nicely. However, with all the veggies and noodles on the plate it was a bit messy to eat and think that for the price and ratio, a tad more meat could've been added.

Where are all the veggies and herbs that usually accompany an order of bánh xèo? Where are the characteristic crispy fried edges of the bánh xèo?

My dad owns a Vietnamese restaurant in Houston and my family and I just came back from an extended trip to Vietnam (including Hanoi and Saigon) and this is NOTHING like any of the (street) foods (or restaurant style foods) that we ate in Vietnam, in my dad's restaurant, or at home.

La Dong,Connie G.,11/11/2024,"I was excited to try a new Vietnamese restaurant in the city. The ambiance / interior decor is modern and beautiful, and the hostess and servers were all super nice and welcoming. In terms of food we got the pate & bone to start (bone marrow, pate in a little jar, and some slices of toasted bread). This was good, but I wish they gave us more slices of bread. We also got the beef pho, which I thought was ok (they use wider noodles than you would usually see in pho) - I liked the sliced garlic and red chilis on the side that you could add to the noodles. Lastly, we ordered the bun cha, which was good but I've had better elsewhere in the city - I thought the meat wasn't  very flavorful.

The burger is genuinely unique - it tasted a lot like pad krapow in sandwich form.

""Street style"" pad thai had good flavor but the portion of rice noodles was disappointingly small, and just disproportionate compared to the decent portion for the $5 crispy pork belly add-on. Yes, I know that's the typical portion at a street stall in Thailand. It still feels underwhelming for a $22 dish at a gentrified Brooklyn eatery. Rice noodles barely cost anything, c'mon now.

Also tried the thai tea cake - okay sponge with good thai tea flavor.

Little Grenjai,Pat L.,26/4/2024,"Today was my second time to the restaurant, though the first was for one of their community dinner events before formally opening - so this was my first try of the quickly-becoming-famous smash burger.

The burger was delicious, well cooked, the toppings were great adding nice flavor, and bun was nice.  Just a very well done smash burger.  The potato slices that you can optionally get on the side were also very freshly fried and delicious, I'd recommend adding them.  I got the smash burger without the cheese as I'm an American-cheese-hater, but didn't miss it at all.

I've been having their pad ka prao pork for a couple years, as they used to have a pop-up near me that was my go to.  Honestly it's my favorite pad ka prao in all of Brooklyn, only NYC places that can compete are in Elmhurst Queens.

Both the dinner service at the community table and lunch service were very good.  Lunch is very casual (order at front and find a seat), but pleasant and quick.  Dinner service was more traditional seated restaurant and was high quality.

Ambiance is great, beautifully designed/decorated restaurant.

Highly recommend!",5,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QjAQ_IqNtmlw0AOwDSv5lA/o.jpg,Single smash burger with fries (no cheese).  Delicious!,Food & Beverage

Little Grenjai,Brian S.,15/9/2024,"This place is amazing. Awesome staff. Taking classic Thai dishes and making them really yummy without changing too much. It's not your normal turn and burn Thai place and they didn't open just to start a business, they're passionate about the food. Can be hard to get a table so reserve a day before at least for dinner. Burger is stupendous. Love their grapow and pad thai even. Their Nam Khao Tod (rice ball dish) is done really well. I've had it twice and it was presented differently both times and tasted slightly different but both were amazing. This place feels very chef driven. Nam Khao Tod is A. hard to find because it's a laborious process to make and not very profitable since it's essentially rice. B. When you can find it, it's not always done well because restaurants will find shortcuts to make the cooking process faster. I'm talking about you Night + Market in LA. Their Nam Khao Tod is disgusting and fake. Sorry. So as a Thai/Lao person who grew up eating Nam Khao Tod or just Nam being made by aunties, it always makes me so happy to eat a good version. So thanks Grenjai for killing it! Wish you continued success and I'll keep spreading the word. The chefs and staff are super nice too and will talk to you when you can. Feels like a nice neighborhood addition.

My only gripe is that people will post up at the few tables they have inside for a while, even when they're done eating. I totally understand that these hipsters are enjoying themselves and it's probably their event for the evening, but yeah get to getting!

Little Grenjai,Honghui Y.,19/6/2024,"The smash burger is indeed worth all of the hype! I highly recommend getting it with the fried duck egg - the jammy yolk that inevitably drips everywhere is a fantastic sauce to mop up with any leftover bun. The burger is also a bit spicy, but the spice level is very tolerable. 

The pad thai is really good too and you can order it with your choice of protein. We had it without any protein since it's cooked with egg and tofu and it was delicious on its own.

The burger is only available for lunch so I dropped by on Juneteenth thinking that I would be taking advantage of a slow day for them. Looks like everyone else had the same idea because the place was jam packed! This unfortunately meant that service was incredibly slow. They also bring food out individually, as they are ready, from the kitchen so for our party of three, our food came out about 30 minutes apart.",4,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,,,Food & Beverage

It's cute and cramped (in the best way) we had a 4 top in the corner, perfect for us. Service was prompt and friendly. Drinks came fast. I ordered multiple small plates from the menu, 2 of the specials, crab rice and the short rib for mains. Honestly I wanted to order everything. 

Plates came out rapid fire one after the other, and we inhaled them. Flavors and textures were complex, spicy enough for me but not too spicy for more timid palates.

Little Grenjai,Vira P.,18/8/2025,"After a tiring day of traveling from the West Coast, I needed nourishment.  My friend had been wanting to try Little Grenjai, so that's where we went. 

However, the item he looked at was on their lunch menu.  Their dinner menu had different items, but we were not disappointed.  We started with the crispy rice salad, which I loved!  I love sour flavors, so the fermented pork sausage was right up my alley.  The lime dressing added spicy and citrus notes, while the peanuts, toasted coconuts, and crispy rice added a wonderful crunch.  The Thai arancini ball added a different textural sensation of crispness.  I just wish the dish was bigger because I could probably eat their entire stock of it. 

As our main, we got the fried chicken dinner.  I love fried chicken, and the Thai flavors made theirs unique.  My friend was allergic to one of the ingredients in the salad that comes with the chicken, so we were able to substitute it with more crispy rice salad.  So that made me very happy.  And I loved the tamarind dipping sauce, that added a sweet tanginess to the fried chicken. 

Service was excellent!  The staff was very helpful in explaining their concept and menu.  The space is tight and lively.  We sat at the bar, but I feel like you can easily strike up a conversation with the table next to you.

We ordered the crispy rice salad, pad thai, massaman short rib and sticky rice sundae. tl;dr:
Crispy rice salad - yes
Massaman short rib - yes
Pad Thai - no
Sticky rice sundae - yes

My favorite was definitely the short rib and we saw a lot of short rib orders being made that night (we sat at the counter which looks directly into the kitchen). Crispy rice salad was delicious as well. 

I was most looking forward to the pad Thai because it was so hyped on the website, but it wasn't my favorite. The noodle texture was a soft and sauced pad thai, but the other ingredients got lost in the noodles and sauce so you couldn't really taste or distinguish them. I felt there was only one wet/soft texture and one predominant flavor. If you're picking carbs, I'd suggest the crab fried rice instead -- we saw a lot being prepared and it looked good. 

The sundae was tasty and different because of the sticky rice flavor and salted peanuts -- that gave it nice varying textures and tastes. However, it was not my personal favorite but it was very good. It was tough not comparing it to Thai Diner's coconut sundae (though they're different) because I recently had it.

I highly recommend finding seating first if you decide to dine in, bc seats will go very quickly. After you sit and choose your food selection, make sure you save your seat then get up to order. Then just sit back and wait for the goodies to arrive. The staff was super sweet and handled the crowd well. I appreciated their calm demeanor amidst the crazy, but they are used to it I'm sure. 

We split the burger and the wings and they were tasty. Next time I'd like to try the pad Thai the pork belly and a few other options but overall. Little Grenjai is definitely a must try. It gets busy tho so be prepared lol.",4,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,,,Food & Beverage
Little Grenjai,Paul K.,13/10/2024,"Alright so I've seen a lot of press on the burger, it's all over the internet and I love burgers so had to come by before it gets more popular. The location is small, very casual, lots of hipsters. I parked across the street on a Saturday afternoon. Walked in with my wife and 2yr old and stroller had to be parked in front. No problem, we sit at the booth my 2 yr is going crazy, touching everything, tapping people at the bar. Probably leave the baby at home. Anyways ordered the burger, made it a double and added the duck egg, got the pad thai with pork cracklin and drunken noodles. The pad thai was amazing, the portion was a little small in my opinion. The drunken noodles were spicy, not like Buffalo wings spicy like thai chillies spicy. If you enjoy spice this is such a great dish, full of flavor. Now the show stopper! The Burger! Wow, first bite you taste the marinated patty. It's strong flavors are well balanced with thai basil, their version of giardiniera and the unctuous egg that drips down the side of your mouth and the side of your hand. It was my favorite dish and have been thinking of is for the past 2 days. I can't wait to go back, will probably get the burger for sure and maybe try their different sides. This place opened Feb 2024 and is already picking up a lot of buzz. Go try the burger, judge for yourself",4,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,,,Food & Beverage

Little Grenjai,Dave D.,4/2/2024,"Welcome Little Grenjai to the neighborhood. The space is brightly lit with lots of daylight, with a modern retro interior, with diner style tables and seats. Staff is friendly but the layout is a little awkward due to the counter service ordering from the coffee bar instead of the front counter, so cramped lines form inbetween tables.

Their Krapow Smashburger is a fantastic take on a smashburger by adding a flair of thai flavors throughout. Chili infused beef patty, american cheese, pickled vegetables (incl. carrots, peppers, and cauliflower!), thai holy basil, and a shrimp-based sauce. This burger is unlike any other burger and tastes like it came right from the streets of Thailand.

Peek Gai Tod fried chicken is good with a great blend of seasoning and marinade. The exterior was nice and crispy with the chicken still tender, albeit slightly oiley. The burgers came out first whereas I had to ask about the chicken since I wasn't sure if it was forgotten about or not. Strange to have the apps come after the mains but since they're brand new they're likely just trying to find the right pacing in the kitchen.

Knock on the menu variety and pricing. The small yet wide variety of dishes seems like it would overwhelm the kitchen and some items are way overpriced (ie. congee is $14 with pork being a $4 add-on). They have a wide variety of beer and wine being served but no coffees or teas despite there being an espresso machine at the coffee bar?

Would love to come back for dinner service or their monthly Tender Bits pop-up as it looks like an awesome experience.",4,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0GQ7etGZQr_xdsncspJSmQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zFx4FdmqL7ZjEOreteu3Cg/o.jpg,Krapow Smashburger; Peek Gai Tod,Food & Beverage
Little Grenjai,Adri P.,30/3/2024,"I had really high expectations for Grenjai after not only seeing tons of social posts about it, and also having a fellow Yelp Eliter recommend the burger to me. Sadly my experience fell flat.

The setup/layout is a bit interesting. You have to walk in between tables to the counter to place your order. It wasn't that busy when I was there, but i could see this being a bit awkward and cramped when it's busy.

When I walked up to the counter the person there was texting or scrolling on their phone. I had to speak before being acknowledged. They quickly apologized and were friendly, as was the other person that brought our food. 

My friend and I ended up ordering the wings, burger, fries, and the minced pork over rice.

- Wings: Soggy. I wish they were still crispy. The sauce only partially coated a few of them and just felt like the flavors hadn't fully melded. I ended up having leftovers, which I airfried the next day and enjoyed a lot more.

- Smash burger: one thing about a smashburger that I love, are those crispy bits that you get form the thin patty. This just didn't have that. Also, the flavor was just pretty flat. It just tasted... spicy. I was expecting more of a flavor explosion, but it just didn't happen. 

- Minced pork: It was really dry. My friend suggested we try it with some of the sauce that came with the wings, and we both found it more enjoyable. We saw others had ordered theirs with an egg, and had we known, we would have done the same. I think the egg would've made for a more memorable dish.

- Fries: Despite having a sensitivity to potatoes, I had to try these lol. They were my favorite part of the meal! I love the cut of these fries--like wavy potato chips.

I'm going to try them again soon for dinner. Hopefully that experience will be a bit different.",3,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,,,Food & Beverage

The restaurant is very, very small. We made reservations and would recommend that. I ordered the Drunken Noodle with Tofu and was really disappointed. It tasted burned, like the fish sauce was over-caramelized, and pretty salty. The Green Papaya Salad we ordered for the table was pretty tasty though. I'm not sure I'd come here again.",2,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,,,Food & Beverage
Little Grenjai,Rabiya I.,31/3/2024,"You should know before you walk in the things that seem vegetarian are not actually vegetarian. All the noodles except Drunken Noodles have a fish sauce base and we were told it couldn't be made without it. So we got 2 out of the total 3 vegetarian things on the menu: brussel sprouts and drunken noodles with tofu puffs. However, they tried convincing us to get the cabbage instead of the brussels (was later wondering if this was bc the brussels or d noodles were also based in fish sauce and they didn't share that) and literally brought us that instead even after we very much declined and then said they accidentally wrote it down (?) Huh? But eventually got our order right. 
Their tofu puffs, respectfully, are a waste of space. Felt like I was biting into air, had no flavor at all. The drunken noodles by themselves were good and the brussel sprouts were decent but after having delicious b-sprouts at another spot the night before this was an embarrassment for this place. Also, if you like your drunken noodles spicy, this isn't the spot for you. It had no spice, they just added peppers on the side. I would not return unless they upgraded their menu to be more vegetarian and vegan friendly and had better service but glad I tried this new spot by my apt so I can at least confirm it was a bad idea! It's always crowded for dinner but it was pretty empty for lunch which made sense after trying it.

UPDATE- after reading Alex L.'s review below where they state they were told the Brussel sprouts were also based in fish sauce ... I'm in shock. BEYOND unprofessional and (quite frankly should be illegal?) of their staff to lie to us when we made it extremely clear we are vegetarian and wouldn't eat anything based in fish sauce. I guess that's why they asked if it was an allergy (we said no) so if it's not allergy I guess they don't care.",2,restaurants; restaurants; restaurants,,,Food & Beverage

Little Grenjai,Alex L.,24/2/2024,"Not great for vegetarians looking to avoid fishy flavors.  I am vegetarian and realize that most Thai uses fish sauce for many dishes.  I asked about if they included fish sauce in their brussel sprouts dish and they said they do.  I said don't worry about it but they put some sauce on the side anyway.  I was prepared to eat the dish the way it is usually prepared but instead it came out separated.  I think this accounted for the dish tasting dry and a bit boring.  The added tofu puffs probably needed something to make them not taste like paper.  I should not have said anything.  That being said, both the desserts were amazing.  The coconut pie and Thai ice tea cake were so good.  I also had a delicious beer.

We started off with the Atsugiri bacon which was perfectly cooked and super succulent. Then I got the niku udon and once again was amazed at just how springy they could make the noodles while still being able to latch onto the sweet and savory niku broth.

You probably won't leave hungry, but you certainly won't leave stuffed.

Gyunan (3/5): I honestly don't think I understood the hype. My favorite part about eating any kind of noodle is the bounce, the satisfying chew.

*Green tea: Solid and straightforward
*Zaru udon with shrimp tempura: I thought this might be too small for myself, but the server told me it would fill me up. She was right! Loved the udon quality. And it came with a bunch of tempura - shiso leaf tempuras, the shrimp tempuras, and a fish tempura. The udon dipping sauce was also fantastic. Loved the mix of quail egg and mushrooms/green onions.

The maitake mushroom added a rich, earthy depth that tied the flavors together so nicely. 

Great service- friendly and attentive without being overbearing, and the interior is absolutely gorgeous: modern, clean, and thoughtfully designed. Our location also had a cafe at the front and my only regret is not grabbing a dessert to go (still thinking about the hojicha panna cotta and soba pudding...).

We started off with the pork gyoza. It was the best thing of the meal. Everything came out steaming hot. We then got the gyunan ribeye hot udon and the sansai hot udon. Both were decent. The meat was well cooked however the broth tasted like hot water. It lacked a lot of flavor. The udon itself though was good.

Raku,Jenn C.,16/3/2025,"Food: The udon is amazing here! My favorite part is the noodle texture. Noodles are perfectly silky and bouncy. It's much better than the udon you typically have in restaurants. My favorite udon here is the tantan which I highly recommend. The beef udon and curry udon are great also, but tantan is a must-get. The monk fish liver appetizer is also very good. I didn't find anything special about the eggplant appetizer though. The quality of food here reminds me of Japan.

Service: Service is excellent here. Staff are friendly and attentive.

Ambiance: I've been to both the West Village and East Village locations. The East Village location is very small and seating is tight whereas the seating is more comfortable at the other location. Overall ambiance is great at both locations though.

Raku,Sandy X.,5/6/2025,My favorite udon spot in NYC. I came here for lunch on a Tuesday and got the seated pretty quickly. I ordered the jaja udon which was a cold udon. This is my first time trying cold udon at Raku and it did mot disappoint. The noodles was chewy and delicious. There was a big pork meat ball which I mixed in with the noodle that gave it a bit of a spice. It was a great dish for a hot summer day.,5,restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PFkRHbaYKOuR7esLf93VGg/o.jpg,Ja Ja Udon,Food & Beverage
Raku,Edna L.,26/1/2025,"Been here plenty of times over the years and have always had a great time! They recently expanded and the interior with the bar at the entrance and separated booth seating right next door. 

Raku is one of my top 5 udon places and has never failed me when I crave a good bowl of noodle soup. This time, I had the tantan udon. The photo doesn't do it justice since the broth pretty much is all you see in the photo. Packed with ground pork, scallions, and peanuts, every bite of the perfectly chewy udon had so much flavor. It also had a bit of spinach and a poached egg, runny yolk and when popped into the broth made it a little creamier. The broth had a nice little kick to it but wasn't overly spicy or salty. Mmm good! 

Every time, the chicken tatsuta-age is a must for an appetizer to share (or not share!). Big bite sized pieces of crispy chicken, topped with lemon juice, and spicy mayo on the side! Every piece of chicken was juicy, not dry, and best when consumed piping hot.

For dessert on the menu (by patisserie fouet), four of us shared the soba pudding and matcha tiramisu. The soba pudding was very light and had a caramelized black sugar base- sweet but not overpowering. If you want dessert that's not too sweet, and tastes close to vanilla ice cream, this is it! 

The matcha tiramisu is every matcha lover's dream. ‍... and so worth taking a lactaid for (lactose intolerance). With layers of mascarpone, green tea sponge cake and topped with toasted rice puffs, every bite was an explosion of very rich matcha taste. You need to love matcha to really enjoy this dessert and I absolutely loved it. It also wasn't too sweet either! 

Overall, I can foresee myself coming back here again and again and am glad they expanded for more space! Service was exceptional as always!",5,restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bSbb32I2Eh9jzqfxRrb05Q/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qFYxlLZzbRsZvY4Ga9nQEw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MFnLCR9QFJhM3e70nCZNHg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2bmcMgYk0C4uoMN61EoRFg/o.jpg,Tantan Udon; Soba Pudding; Chicken Tatsuta-Age (small - 6 pieces); Matcha Green Tea Tiramisu,Food & Beverage
Raku,Ruby C.,5/12/2024,"Winter is around the corner, and I find myself craving for hot soup and noodles more often. I was impressed by Raku's cold dipping udon last time, but their warm udon is EVEN BETTER! I almost drank up the entire bowl of hot soup. 

We went to their East Village location, which was much smaller and more cramped than the other locations. I highly recommend making a res to avoid the wait (yes, there's a wait even on weekdays!)

＊Gyunan Udon 牛南うどん $21
If you don't want to splurge on their wagyu udon ($35 for American Mishima or $42 for Japanese A5 Miyazaki beef), gyunan would be the perfect choice. The beef was so tender and juicy that I enjoyed every bite of it. It almost melted in my mouth. Compared to wagyu, prime beef was less heavy and had a lower fat ratio. 

How could they keep the chewiness and bounciness while serving the udon in hot broth!? I am usually picky about udon soup's texture, but this one ticked every box. 

Let's talk about the soup -- it looked clear but it was actually bursting with flavor.

The soup is hearty and they have a good variety of options to choose from on their menu, including hot or cold udon. The area is pretty small but nice in the inside. Aside from the food, our server kept rushing us to order and also clearing our bowls towards the end. We were only there for one hour total but in less than 10 minutes, the server came back to us twice asking us if we were ready to order when we let them know we needed a little more time the first time they came around.

Raku,Billy C.,11/2/2025,"We had a reservation at 5:30pm on a Sunday and though the other guests in my party were running late, they sat me down right away and were very understanding, which I greatly appreciated.

I started off with the hot organic green tea, which warmed me up right away from the frigid walk to the restaurant. For starters, we ordered the Sabazushi (three mackerel pressed sushi) and Chawanmushi (steamed egg). The sushi was nicely made as both the fish and rice were fresh. The egg was silky and well seasoned. They were also generous with the seafood and toppings. 

For entrees, I ordered the Toriten Udon (four marinated fried chicken) and the other guests ordered the Kamonan Udon (LI duck breast, Tokyo negi). For the Toriten, I asked for the chicken to be on the side and I'm glad I did because the chicken was crispy and juicy and I enjoyed eating it with the chili powder. The udon and broth were simple, but made very well - one of the best in the city!

I first came when they were a small spot, before they expanded and added another location, and came back a second time after the expansion. The udon noodles are super flavorful, and they're doing some modern and creative twists to some of their dishes. The bacon dish which is essentially a giant slab of pork belly is a winner, although out of the 2 times I've had it, it was a bit on the drier side, but when it hits it hits. The curry and wagyu udon were also quite delicious, and I would recommend this place as one of the best udon places in NYC, not that we have tooooo many in manhattan.

Raku,Christina N.,3/1/2025,"Perfect on a cold day, especially if you want a quieter, more peaceful dining experience.

We opted for bar seating as it would get us in sooner and it was still a good experience (except for the bursts of cold air as the door opened/closed)!

I ordered the kamonan udon (duck) and it was delicious, hearty with a strong duck flavor, maybe a little salty for me towards the end. The noodles are nice and chewy, and the duck was perfectly cooked. It was a large serving, which could serve as two meals if noodle dishes traveled well enough for that.

The flavors of the broth are very rich and thick. The NIKU udon tastes very similar to Korean braised beef broth, which felt a little heavy for my liking. I did order a side of spicy/chili oil which helped clear my palate. NIKU is one of their most popular dishes! 

The cold udon (I forgot name) was very refreshing, something similar to soba noodles. 

Lastly, the Shichiken tasted similar to something in the ball park of chicken noodle soup. If you like chicken noodle soup, you will definitely like this one! There is also 2 pieces of mochi inside, which was fun to eat!!!

Niku udon - I loved the qq noodles in this, the short braised rib was soft and tender but the soup reminded me of a Taiwanese beef noodle soup especially after you add the spicy sauce. It was good but definitely not your typical udon, at least for me. I'd try something else next time.

Buta shabu - I don't typically order cold noodles but it was 90 degrees when we visited and the table next to us each person had one of these so it had to be good. The noodles on this were different from the soup udon since they were flat, the goma (peanut) sauce was delicious and light.

Menu is still a bit overwhelming with the number of options though. I think the noodles are made in-house + by hand, which makes all the difference. Good length with the perfect amount of chew.

Raku,Maricar T.,13/7/2024,"Raku, An Udon Shop on NYC's ""Curry Lane""

Despite the heat of a July summer day in New York, I still opted to have hot udon. Among the several options, I went for a smoked herring- based soup that was phenomenally layered with flavors. The udon noodle was silky smooth. The karaage was delightfully light, crunchy and perfect with the accompanying fish roe mayo. I also ordered a yuzu-based cocktail drink along with the trio of cold side dishes -- burdock, spinach and hijiki -- that provided quick relief from the heat of the udon and searing weather. 

Although the place was rather claustrophobic for the teeny-bit of windowless and dark indoor space, the place was filled up quickly by guests who didn't seem to mind. The overflow guests were ushered at the outdoor space, a semi-permanent structure by the street that was built right after the pandemic. The udon restaurant also has two branches located in Midtown and Greenwich Village. 

This Raku branch is located in a block on 6th Street between First and Second Avenues in Lower East Side that's nicknamed the ""Curry Lane""  or ""Curry Lane"" as it has become the destination for curry-inspired Asian food since the late 60s. 

Raku is not on any swanky critic's list like the Michelin guide, but the affordable food was elegant, authentic and made from high quality ingredients. This will be on my permanent list of favorites.

Raku,Joann S.,4/1/2025,"Service was great, the staff is super attentive and didn't rush us at all. However, the food wasn't as good as the Toronto location that I've been to. There's hardly any meat, maybe about a spoon of ground pork and the soup didn't really taste strong of peanut. The chicken karaage was good.

Raku,Evelynne L.,17/8/2024,"Raku takes comfort food to the highest level! I love a good noodle soup on any day and raku has some of the best udon I have ever tried. We ordered the salmon oshizushi as an appetizer and the salmon was super fresh and tasted delicious. I love the salmon roe on top for extra taste. I ordered the gyunan udon and it was so yummy, the broth was perfect, the meats inside were so soft and tender and the udon's texture is perfectly chewy and not soggy. The portion was also huge! So it is great value.

When my friends and I got here around 7:30pm on a Saturday there was quite the wait, it was about an hour and they said they would message us when our table is ready so we just went to a nearby bar to grab drinks before we were seated for our meal.",5,restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/itl8udaYrtUR1FgeWGsWUA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/P51YGMA7ULl-qavsh5Kjcg/o.jpg,Gyunan Udon; Salmon Oshizushi,Food & Beverage
Raku,Katie W.,31/12/2024,"I came on a snowy weekday and was immediately seated - and there were a lot of empty tables (a nice change from dinnertime when you usually need to wait a whole hour). I typically go to the Soho location but this was my first time at the East Village one. This location is a lot smaller and homier!

The udon was pretty similar in quality though I thought it was a little less el dente than the soho location. The donbori was actually way better here - the meat was more tender and I thought the sauce to rice ratio was perfect (I thought it was too much rice at the soho location). Definitely get the agedashi tofu - this is actually my favorite thing here and I love the bonito flakes and sauce they pair it with.

Solid classic as always.",4,restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/O8qW14TCgRUFq8HZ1NlgYA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hVnzTNYXMZrHyRo2_9sXfw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3rhhK0Y7qaVy-1pZPOK89Q/o.jpg,Niku Udon; Agedashi Tofu; Donbori,Food & Beverage
Raku,Katherine C.,9/2/2025,"*I would give a 4.3/5 but thought it would be fair to give 5 on yelp

Raku is one of the top udon places in New York and I have visited the Soho location before. I decided to try the East Village location because I thought it would be bigger (it is not) and I really enjoy the udon. I went as a walk in for 2 around 8 and was told there was a 45 minute wait. We put our names down and went across the street to get a drink while we waited. The host texts us 4 minutes after we put our name down and it said we had 10 minutes to confirm so I confirmed but we didn't get back until 15-20 after we had confirmed since we needed to close out at the bar. It said our table was released but I decided to go up to the host anyways and let her know we got texted so we could try to get the next available table. Immediately she looks down at the iPad and makes a smirking face and proceeds to tell us what we did isn't allowed and she decided to do us a favor and give us an open table but if we're going to go somewhere else while we wait we have to be back in time. I understand they didn't need to save our table but she was pretty rude in the way she communicated it and could've been nicer. This hostess definitely left a bad impression since we didn't expect them to save the table even though they were 40 minutes off on the wait estimate, and she acted weirdly annoyed at us.

Despite this, the rest of our experience was positive. Our server was extremely friendly and we got the Yuzu mimosa and agedashi tofu appetizer. The mimosa is exactly like what it sounds and super bubbly and refreshing with strong yuzu flavor. Agedashi tofu was delicious and the bonito flakes honestly tasted like a smokey fish jerky on top. The sauce was also great.

I got the Gyunan udon which I expected to be a bit more meaty and savory in flavor but it was a more light and clean broth (still very good). Udon is chewy and wonderful texture. The gyunan was a bit lackluster overall since the meat was not very soft and I think it could've used some more fatty slices of beef and more beef in general. I tried the spicy Niku broth and it was amazing so a better option for something more hearty. 

Matcha tiramisu is my favorite dessert and theirs wasn't my favorite version but still very good! I like how the matcha flavor was strong and it was not too sweet at all. The one thing I didn't love was the gelatin/pudding stuff at the bottom because the texture was a little weird but the flavor was great! 

I will also add it is super weird that the restaurant is separated into two halves. I was in the tiny half with the kitchen but the servers have to walk outside on the street for like 30 feet and go to the other side to bring food. The interior is nice but the setup is odd. 

Overall, I really like Raku but I prefer the Soho location since it is a bit bigger so less wait times. If it weren't for the host I would give this place a 9.3/10 but it honestly brought it down since service is an important factor for me. I enjoy the udon here despite the gyunan missing a little bit of flavor for me and being somewhat pricey but I will definitely return to try some more unique udons.",5,restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KUfF_HWs8Hmh4ZuwRaiaWQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/D6ejV5Npcfebtwf_9c9CHQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1K8QiBv6X7ZU_1GslmOm4Q/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/y39QbyN175egcsvUldlApA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eeKuX4yqx1PeGwo5DPH3SA/o.jpg,Green Tea Tiramisu; Agedashi Tofu; Spicy Niku Udon; Gyunan Udon; yuzu mimosa,Food & Beverage
Raku,Brandon L.,20/3/2025,"Good comfort food. The restaurant was super cozy.

We were brought here by my friend who is a local, this is his girlfriend's favorite restaurant.

I ordered the yaki (vegetarian style) and my wife the toriten (chicken on the side so it doesn't get soggy).

I thought the chicken from the toriten was amazingly juicy. The yaki was really flavorful with a tomatoey sauce, and the cabbage in it was fresh and crunchy.

My wife thought that the seaweed broth from the toriten soup was okay but liked the noodle texture and the chicken.

Big portions too, lots of noodles, but options on the menu get pricey really easily.

Staff were friendly and easy to flag down when we wanted to order more noodles.",4,restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_d7J9Q_6GYtloDxas9y1CQ/o.jpg,Menu,Food & Beverage
Raku,Sabrina H.,4/2/2025,"My friend and I met up for the first time in 2 years here and had a really warm and yummy lunch - a perfect place to catch up and eat well. We arrived right when they opened and there was already a small group of people lined up waiting to get in. The inside is small and cozy, reminding me of Japan. 

We started off with the chicken tatsuta-age and we immediately needed to down some water after taking a bite. Although it was flavorful and the batter was nice and crispy while the meat was tender, there was way too much added salt and not even the spicy mayo nor lemon could balance it out. I was disappointed since I had read rave reviews on their karaage. But I did appreciate that you could choose between 6 or 10 pieces of chicken.

Now onto what we came here for and what ultimately saved this meal - udon! I ordered the kamonan (duck breast) while my friend got the tantan udon. Portions are crazy big. If I weren't here to visit, I would have split this into lunch and dinner but I ended up finishing it and walking out looking pregnant. The duck was extremely tender and the noodles were cooked to perfection. So bouncy, chewy, and everything I have ever wanted. Incredible broth and if I wasn't already so full, I would have drank every last drop of it. Overall a comforting meal that left me satisfied.

The service was great up until the end, when something out of the ordinary happened to us. After payment and tipping, one of the waiters came up to us and told me that I had tipped so low (I tipped 15%, which is average?) and he ASKED for my reasoning. Dumbfounded and confused, I had to reassure him that everything was okay and hurried out of there. I was telling another friend about this and she mentioned that the same thing happened to her after dining at this location as well. Maybe they were trained to do this? Just an awkward and very weird experience. Amazing noodles, though.",4,restaurants; restaurants,,,Food & Beverage
Raku,Stephen P.,8/3/2025,"dined at this exceptional Japanese comfort food restaurant and was thoroughly impressed. Their Chicken Tatsuta-Age stands out as the best I've ever tasted. Tatsuta-Age is a style of Japanese fried chicken where the meat is marinated in soy sauce and mirin, then coated with potato starch before frying, resulting in a crispy texture and rich flavor.  The service was impeccable--both swift and courteous. Omg, that bacon is sizzling and delicious. The egg broth udon soup is also very satisfying and warming. Very thick!

As a lot of people have said, the udon was a bit overhyped, but was refreshing for this summer day. Super friendly and fast service. A little cramped indoor seating, but spacious outdoor area! 

Sabazushi (Mackerel sushi, $8) {4/5}: I liked the smoky flavor on this grilled mackerel. Add the togarashi from the table if you want a little spice 

Zaru (cold noodle with dipping sauce, $14) {3.5/5}: The dipping sauce was a good balance. It came with a raw quail egg, real grated wasabi, seaweed, and scallions that you mix into the sauce - the highlight of the dish. The noodles were just okay 

Maitake (Mushroom tempura add-on, $6) {1.5/5}: No flavor on its own, had to add togarashi and dip it into the udon dipping sauce. Not that crispy either

we also got an agedashi tofu as an appetizer but we originally wanted their sabazushi (they were sold out) the agedashi tofu was good too! no complaints

Udon here was good but not something that I would rave about. I tried the ankake, and the noodles weren't as bouncy & chewy as I would have liked.

In the winter I gravitate towards their duck (kamonan - long island duck breast, tokyo negi) or beef (gyunan - prime beef, tokyo negi) options, while their zaru udon (chilled noodles, shiso leaf tempura, dipping sauce) with extra tempura is a wonderful summer option.

For starters we ordered a salad and the Karaage. The salad was a solid starter, and while delicious, it was very much on the nutty end! So if you're not a fan of nuts, maybe give it a skip. 

The Karaage on the other hand was superb, a very solid Karaage with a moist inside and a great, crunchy exterior. The sauce they provided was also very good!

As for the udons themselves, my friend ordered the Snow crab udon while I got the duck breast udon, and both of them were superb. The noodles were perfectly chewy, the broth was to kill for, and the duck breast was incredibly tender and flavorful.

(Niku Udon: A) - This udon bowl is paired with an assortment of beef cuts that are braised to tenderness. I love to deep earthy development in the broth of the soup to pair with their fresh udon noodles. The only thing I would improve about this bowl is to give more of the delicious meat and vegetable, but otherwise its beautifully executed.

Raku,Sophia N.,11/9/2024,"Raku is very well loved for their udon. We started our meal with the gyoza and miso eggplant which were both great. For my udon, I went with the cold tempura udon. I wasn't too impressed with the tempura because it was soggy on the bottom.

Raku,Love K.,18/4/2024,"Hubs was feeling adventurous and walked to Raku to check out the wait time on a Sunday evening. He was quoted 30 minutes so I walked on over to him mid-way prior to us getting our table. We sat indoors which was quite the tight fit but it worked out. 

We ordered the following for starters: 
+ Fried Chicken: these were a little spicy. Hubs quite enjoyed this
+ Pork Gyoza: basic but delicious

For the main course, I ordered the Sansai which came with ""mountain vegetables"" and maitake mushroom tempura. The mushroom tempura was out of this world. It was super flavorful and meaty for what was a vegetable udon dish. I also ordered the Shrimp Tempura to eat on the side which was perfectly fried. It was a must have.

The service was slightly non-existent. Once you order, the staff doesn't quite check up on you after unless you're flagging them down to get the check. Nonetheless, the meal was delightful.",4,restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/m4m-3N3JJ1Hv3eQp2TohPA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZHPHR1NVrXgfcSGEm0CNSw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/q1hxXot_rFl3RgfmZ_ywAQ/o.jpg,Fried Chicken; Pork Gyoza; Sansai,Food & Beverage

The gyunan beef reminded me of the pho ribeye meat: the nabeyaki was more flavorful. Restaurant was very busy but the wait time was 15 minutes.

Raku,Genovese L.,12/4/2024,"Delicious udon in East Village! Came here for lunch with a party of 3 and we were seated right away at the outdoor patio. The service was quick and friendly!

I ordered the Toriten Udon, which is a hot udon that comes with four good-sized pieces of fried chicken. The soup was light and refreshing! Definitely would be a good hangover meal after a long night out. The noodles had a nice bit to them and they give you a generous portion of them. I also liked there were some veggies included, which helped offset the heaviness of the noodles and chicken. 

All in all, a solid udon spot that I'd recommend!",4,restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qsx3YITAnBrgOlFEAV1OTA/o.jpg,Toriten Udon,Food & Beverage

Raku,Fuang C.,1/4/2024,"I first came to Raku years ago and remembered it tasting really good. We decided to check it out again since we were in the area and craving udon. There wasn't much of a wait and we didn't have a reservation either (though I'm not sure if they even take reservation's). 

The inside is pretty small with one bathroom. There's more outdoor seating than indoor seats. We were seated outside which was a little cramped and a little scary right by the road. Service was attentive and fast. We ordered the Niku udon and a duck udon. I enjoyed the Niku udon more. The soup flavor was light but flavorful and the udon noodles were chewy. I wonder if they make their own udon noodles because the shape is a little different, the ends flare out like a trapezoid. The Niku udon didn't have as much meat as I would've liked. The duck udon was even lighter. 

Oh, they give these frozen grapes as a little treat with your check. 

Overall: I remembered it being better. It was still good but I wasn't that impressed and I also felt like the prices are a little expensive. I do feel like the Niku udon is a little overpriced.",4,restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lOEShs4CjmOvub5VAYVTmA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Q23GUCdsk5bstVyvNOgDkw/o.jpg,Duck udon; Niku Udon,Food & Beverage

Raku,Johnny N.,2/2/2024,"When the aroma of Raku's Niku Udon first hits my nostrils, I am drawn to it like a crack fiend to a lit crack spoon. I immediately get transported to a hole in the wall noodle shop in Kyoto that is playing lofi bangers that Shazam can't pick up. Deep cuts only.

I came here alone on my lunch break today as on a cold rainy day my heart, mind, and soul immediately go to a Raku meal. This is a fantastic place for a solo meal to just come and enjoy your own company... while we are on the topic I get so annoyed when people be posting about how they are going on solo meals. Like can't you just go do that and not post about it? Was it really a solo meal if you gotta tell everyone about it?..... Well I guess I'm doing that now just in Yelp form ahahaha damn.

The Niku Udon's spice level is just enough to make your nostrils run and let out one of those quick little ""woooo"" breaths out of your mouth, which is my idyllic spice level.

The voluminous bowl, which consists of a light flavorful broth, silk noodles, beef short-rib, nori sansho chili oil, tendon, and honeycomb tripe is my hangover cure. Well that and a couple puffs of a pre-roll but that's neither here nor there.

I let out an audible ""wow"" on my final sip of the broth, as my soul needed it. My soul been hella tired lately idk why.

My only complaint is that $27 before tax and tip is just steep. It can't be a weekly occurrence for me, as much as I would like it to. Once a quarter vibes smh. But that just seems to be the price of doing business these days in New York. I've spent $27 a lot worse......

Still my favorite rainy day meal in NYC.

The outside of the restaurant is definitely unassuming and if you weren't actively looking for it, you could easily miss it. I ordered the Tantan udon and my friend ordered the Niku! The Niku was very light and easy on the stomach. The tantan was extremely delicious and had lots of flavor, however be warned it is quite salty and rich.

Raku,Amber C.,22/1/2024,"Definitely the best udon place in manhattan. Tsurutontan doesn't even compare.

Place is quite small and cramped, and can get busy so I would recommend an off time or put yourself on the waitlist.

I ordered the niku udon (spicy) and the chicken tatsuta-age (10 pieces). At first glance, the prices are expensive ($26 for niku udon), which is insane for a noodle dish. However, they do not skimp on the portions for meat and noodles. The udon was spicy and had a rich broth, but the noodles were by far the best part. The noodles were the bounciest and chewiest noodles I've ever had. The meat was tender and flavorful as well.

The chicken tatsuta-age was very crispy and big portions as well.

Raku,Valerie W.,25/5/2025,"The portions are generous and were perfect to eat during a cold rainy day in New York. I went here with two of my friends who mentioned how popular and good this place was, which I do agree with getting a reservation as the usual waiting times for a walk-in would be around 45 minutes. I got the curry udon and shared the chicken tatsua. Everything here that was served was so fresh, the chicken tatsua was so hot when it came here and the same with the udon. I liked the udon that I got, with how thick the curry broth and the noodles were chewy. I thought the ribeye beef was good, though as a protein it wasn't anything revolutionary. With the reservation, we got seated in the dining room which was cozy and intimate, with spacious tables. Our service was also great too, they ensured that we were well taken care of and liked everything to our taste. I would come again as it is a pretty affordable casual lunch / dinner spot that is honestly worth the price.

Raku,Joanna M.,10/2/2024,"Raku scores on udon texture and refreshingly flavorful broth.

My friend and I came 30 minutes after they opened and indoor seating was full so we opted to sit outside in the heated tent. Since we were seated outdoors, there wasn't much of an ambiance. The indoor ambiance also followed a Japanese minimalist blueprint and a little dark since there were no windows to let in natural light. 

Service is quick, efficient, and unintrusive. You can tell the business model here is to bring out the good food and turn tables as quickly as possible. Even without the servers pressuring you to leave, you can feel the pressure if people are waiting for your table. But that's with any popular restaurant in Manhattan that is affordably priced so Raku is no different.

Food wise, the udon is definitely fresh and the noodle consistency is king. Both the thinner noodles in my Spicy Niku Udon and the thicker noodles in my friend's Tantan Udon were the perfect amount of bouncy. The broths in both udons were also delicious with the Spicy Niku broth being lighter but flavorful and the Tantan broth being rich and decadent. They also give a decent amount of protein in each dish.

For the quality and price, Raku delivers. But don't expect to sit for hours and catch up with a friend when there is a line out the door.

We ended up sitting at the bar, but it was just 2 of us and honestly the vibes were great and service was super fast.

Cold Udon Yamakake: (9/10) This dish comes with grated mountain yam, quail eggs, and bonito flakes -- so delicious ! The udon noodles are chewy and thick. The green onions and flakes are crunchy and provide the most complementary texture with the chewiness of the noodles. Each spoonful was yummy af

Bloody Mari (8/10): This drink was tangy and zesty, a nice blend of tomato-y and citrus-y flavors. However, I felt it was a little too strong for my taste and didn't really pair well with the udon.

I feel as though customers should be told beforehand that there is an AC issue prior to making a reservation as this seems like an ongoing issue from previous reviews. 

As I walked in I thought oh it's hot but like any other restaurant I'll probably cool down in a couple minutes but that never happened.  The food was not bad but I would never come back due to the AC issue. I was eating hot soup noodles while sitting in this sauna of a restaurant trying not to overheat.

Raku,Jerry H.,24/6/2024,"I think Raku truly lives up to its hype and is the place I take friends when I need to introduce them to good udon. There are no reservations here and for a relatively small restaurant the waits can get a bit long, but usually on weeknights its doable to walk in here hungry and not have to wait too long. 

I tend to get the fried chicken here which is pretty tasty and always comes out fresh. We tried the monkfish liver as an appetizer once and was really pleasantly surprised by the texture and taste. You really can't go wrong with the udon choices here - the udon noodles are nice and chewy and stand out here compared to other places.

I went on a Saturday evening and waited about 30mins to be seated after putting my name down. You can join the waitlist on yelp actually. 

I always get the tantan udon which is a delicious spicy miso with minced pork and their fried chicken that is cooked to perfection. Their udon is just absolutely the best. So chewy and the broth flavor is absorbed into the noodles so every bite is just *chefs kiss*. This time we decided to also try their pork gyoza and wow we were surprised at how good it was.

The texture of the udon noodles were perfectly chewy and delicious and portion size was excellent, but the broth came lukewarm instead of warm/hot which made the meal a bit disappointing. My friend's bowl was the same case. I love warm soup noodles on a cold day, but Raku didn't execute the way I had hoped. I thought the room-temperature broth was odd, but maybe I came at an off time?

Raku,Karen Y.,29/10/2023,"Great vibe, delicious udon. Would I wait more than 10 mins..? Meh probably not. I might be the odd-woman out tho... hehe 

I got there 10 mins before it opens at 12 noon, a party of 3 was already in queue... once they raise up the ""blue"" mini-curtain, it means they are open for guests.  (Very Japan Culture!). Very cozy inside, a few solo counter seatings and a few tables for parties of 2 & 4 combo.  They also offer outside seatings.  Simplicity in decor - no clutter!  Service is great, efficient and warm. 

I got myself the wakame (seaweed) udon + shrimp tempura.  The udon texture was bouncy, chewy and silky... delicious! The mixture of seaweed was a yummy distraction... from the slightly over-salted broth... just a tad bit. The shrimp tempura was nice & crunchy (honestly, I've had better ones...).  So... I enjoyed my udon very much but would I go out of my way, walking 8+ blocks from my train station... and do it all over again? Not really. Only if I'm around the area and by chance with no wait time. 

Raku was on my bookmarked spots for a while and then it kept popping up in my IG feed from a few ppl I follow... this one was definitely an ""influenced"" eat.",4,restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/f5Ps8YwHP2gJVQXxQO6OLQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HmRp5v_cUZMUMKAytvlsCw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lNq6qSBYbngVLCIEUIS8UQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3FWoGtiTIeBvkWOpD-eU7w/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nPl0Rf5u9g23_cImMkkRAw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tzGpsI5xLHqwmTkIW-1WvA/o.jpg,Blue means open!; Seaweed Udon; Setting; Outdoor seatings; Queue before their 12 noon open; My meal - Wakame Udon + Tempura,Food & Beverage
Raku,Kaitlin C.,6/1/2024,"Raku has got to be one of my favorite udon places! I went on a Friday night with a friend around 6:30, and we got seated at the bar immediately.

As for food:
- Chicken Tatsuga-age: 5/5 Super crispy and flavorful! The pieces were big and soo juicy, the chicken was dripping after every bite.
- Ebiten Udon: 4.5/5 The noodles were definitely the best part of the dish - they were so soft and chewy! The broth also had a nice umami flavor, but it came out a lukewarm instead of warm/hot as I had hoped.

My friend also ordered the Wakame (seaweed) Udon which she said was really good!

Overall, the udon here is great and definitely hits the spot on a cold day. Their noodles are probably the best I've had in NYC. I would definitely come back to try their other udon dishes!",5,restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KJhMoF2G6tTnhJPcT9lwRA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BoRaC2SKzxBfyJ8Xs7BPdg/o.jpg,"Chicken Tatsuta-Age; Ebiten Udon, Wakame Udon",Food & Beverage
Raku,Julie C.,2/7/2024,"i got the curry udon and it was just okay. the noodles weren't chewy/springy as i expected and the flavor was a bit watery for my liking.

the chicken and sauce was AMAZING - fried to perfection, juicy, and seasoned! the sauce made you want more.

usually there is a wait but if you come at opening you can get seated immediately! 

overall a bit overhyped but still a good meal.",4,restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/miDIXpQWUmBDtQKIGJhckg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lKRR_kHl29i0bICG6oFvQQ/o.jpg,Curry Udon; Chicken Tatsuta-Age,Food & Beverage
Raku,Xin W.,30/12/2023,"I can't say enough good things about Raku. We went when it was raining and there was still a line. But I have to say it was definitely worth the wait. I can't wait to go back! 

First, the service was fast. All the staff were very nice and attentive. We sat in the outside portion, but the overhead heaters were nice and toasty, such a cozy ambiance!

As for food, we ordered the chicken tatsuta-age,
spicy Niku udon, and gyunan udon. Everything was so delicious. The fried chicken was crispy and soooo juicy. The udon had a qq element to the noodles, not soggy and had a soft, chewy bite to them. The broth wasn't salty, and you could actually enjoy all the flavors. 10/10 restaurant and 100% not overrated",5,restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WkaOzfZ3PQ-4BSAIGjgYSA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8WXT5hhO7lAdJagXIOgS4Q/o.jpg,Spicy Niku Udon; Chicken Tatsuta-Age,Food & Beverage

Raku,Steph W.,12/5/2024,"Ambiance (4/5): The inside nicely lit with a clean Asian decor. It is very tight with approx capacity of 20. However the outdoor dining is almost double the inside. We sat outside and (as expected) decorations were a bit sparse. The noise levels were moderate. 
Service (5/5): It is a walk-in only. We waited about 20 min before getting seated at 6:45ish. The staff checked in on us often and our glasses were regularly refilled. Our food came pretty quickly.
Niku (3/5): the broth is unbelievably umami! The portion of meat was meager and felt like there was more tendon  and tripe than it was short rib. I was expecting a bit more for the $26 price point. If you ask for the spicy oil on the side, there's much less than if you ordered the spicy version. 
Sesame Apricot (3/5): it was a beautiful presentation but the taste didn't blow me away. There were hints of the sesame in the cake layer and then added sweetness from the bottom layer of apricot. It's a great dessert to split amongst 2.
Yuzu Sake (5/5): we had 2 pours each between 3 with the middle size option (400c).",4,restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/O4lJSybHDFv9u6XXu7CYMw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qNpGUKTfwglsa0sKCDyfYQ/o.jpg,Sesame Apricot; Niku Udon,Food & Beverage
Raku,Jocelyn G.,9/11/2024,"Yummy Japanese spot. Prices were pretty decent for New York. I got the curry udon with beef. The udon noodles are nice and chewy. The bowls are huge! The curry was more like a soup and a bit thinner than I was prefer, but still delicious.  They have a nice outdoor seating area with heating lamps, so outdoor seating was enjoyable even in the cold.",4,restaurants; restaurants,,,Food & Beverage
Raku,Christina W.,21/12/2023,"Expect to have a decent wait time on the weekends. We were a party of 5 and had to wait around an hour to be seated. The place is pretty small itself but they do have outdoor seating. Servers were accommodating and kind.

I don't remember the udons we each had but do remember that the curry one was pretty tasty but had a thick broth. Regardless of what flavor, you can expect a pretty good meal that with fill you up.",5,restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XZp46XviGeWKnExeTLLiYw/o.jpg,udon,Food & Beverage
Raku,Yana S.,22/2/2025,The best udon ever. I used to go to Udon West but after it closed I was never able to find good udon. This is better!! The waitresses and hosts were very nice and tried their best to accommodate us. We didn't have a reservations but we went next door and drank some wine for two hours while waiting. Honestly the wait is worth it. It's very cozy and smells delicious when you walk in. Great vibes. But definitely make a reservation at least a day before because they are so busy. For good reasons. Will be back !!!,5,restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_RCp4vPL-UB7bopXe1k-4g/o.jpg,Gyunan Udon,Food & Beverage
Raku,Yulee K.,30/5/2024,"WOW. This place is amazing. They have minimal seating inside the restaurant but they just opened the outdoor seating area so there's more seats available. The servers were very kind and attentive to our needs. 

The udon surprised me when it came out. It comes in a ginormous bowl and I thought that it was just the plating. But it was literally a never-ending bowl of udon. The broth was so clean and refreshing and the meat that came with it had soaked up all of the broth flavoring so it burst with flavor. I also am not sure but it looked like their noodles were hand pulled. The noodles were so chewy and bouncy. I would highly recommend this place for a good hearty bowl of udon.",5,restaurants; restaurants,,,Food & Beverage

Raku,Linan C.,2/10/2023,"My absolute favorite spot for udon. I cannot even believe I'm saying this because I don't usually like udon. 
I had ordered their Washugyu Yaki Udon and the beef wasn't even the best part! The udon was! I can just eat two whole bowls of udon with soup and nothing else!!! 
They are usually packed and have a line out the door since the place is super small.

The chewy, bouncy texture of the noodles here is ELITE, and the broth doesn't feel heavy at all - a win in my book!! A classic to get is the Gyunan, but their Niku also never disappoints, as the bowl is packed with delicious meat toppings. 

I love that they give a refreshing, frozen grape to close off the meal, and the service is super attentive.

My friend had a reservation for the evening, so we didn't wait long before getting seated, but there was a line for those who didn't have reservations. They sat us at the counter so we were facing the wall but it was really nice cozy and intimate! Note that they also have outdoor seating. 

I got their cold udon noodle and my friend got their hot beef udon noodle. Both were delicious! Noodles were really chewy and the broth for the hot udon was very flavorful. The sauce in the cold noodle was also flavorful, and tasted really refreshing. The dish came in huge bowls but the portion was actually perfect, I felt content and not overly fully afterwards. Definitely recommend checking out this spot!",5,restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vFK2oJQknKRS_Wyn1G0ZrA/o.jpg,Cold Ja Ja Udon,Food & Beverage
Raku,Citlali A.,22/10/2024,"I love Raku. Probably one of the places I go to most in the city. A huge hot bowl of the gyunan udon is delicious on any day but especially when it gets chilly outside. The staff is top notch and the vibes inside are kind of new age japanese-american style with lots of wood details. Definitely get a reservation for a party of more than two, and for 2 people expect a wait. But as a solo diner you can usuall sneak in right away or with a very short wait. I love you Raku.",5,restaurants; restaurants,,,Food & Beverage
Raku,Keo B.,20/1/2025,"Such a good udon and perfect for a cold, snowy NYC visit! I got the a5 wagyu udon and added a poached egg and side of shrimp tempura. It was so delicious and the udon was piping hot but so slurp-able! The udon noodles initially were chewier than I expected but liked it. The marinated fried chicken appetizer / karaage was very delicious too - large juicy pieces that are crispy on the outside. We (party of 4) walked in on a Sunday evening around 6pm and had a wait inside an hour. Place gets packed but not overly noisy (saw a decent amount of couples on dates, as well as big groups), and service was attentive. Can't wait to go the next time I'm in NYC!",5,restaurants; restaurants,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VGLmB6TQ1ZF0-cplr5SkVQ/o.jpg,Wagyu Udon (A5) with Shrimp Tempura and poached egg as toppings,Food & Beverage
