JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Caili C.,30/11/2022,"We stayed at the JW for 3 nights during our trip to Singapore and I have to say everything from our room to the hotel amenities are fantastic! We were lucky to be upgraded to a junior suite corner room which to our surprise was huge with a separate living room and 1.5 baths. I loved the layout of the bathroom and the 2 walls of large windows in our corner room bedroom! 

The Executive Lounge is fantastic with breakfast, afternoon tea and hors 'doeuvres daily. The breakfast has a made-to-order omelette and noodle soup bar and rotates the dishes enough that it doesn't get boring eating in the lounge every morning. 

There's also 2 pools which provide nice views of the city (in particular the pool on the 18th floor). They were a bit cold to swim in but I saw plenty of people relaxing around and in the gym in the mornings. 

As an additional note, we mentioned we were staying in Singapore as a part of our honeymoon trip and being Ambassador Elite members, we received a $100 credit towards Marriott activities and tours for our stay from the hotel. This was the first and only time I've received such a nice gift and I was really blown away by the staff here.",5,eventservices,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nG9D-4rZ5h14b2_w0NSgiQ/o.jpg,Hotel pool view,Hotels
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Jennifer W.,1/1/2024,"Classy and modern hotel, easy to reach by MRT. Room was fairly spacious and we had a view of the pool. Bathroom was very large and there was plenty of closet space, plus a couch alongside the entire window. We only stayed one night, so can't speak to a longer term stay, but check-in was very smooth. There was a long line when we went to check-out so a staff member just collected our room keys and asked for the room we were checking out of and I received my invoice via email. 

Our reservation didn't have access to breakfast, and we didn't have time to use the pool, but both looked nice if we had another chance to stay here. There's staff out front that were happy to call a car for you, we didn't need one, but other folks did utilize the service. All in all, it was a pleasant stay, nothing to complain about it.",4,eventservices,,,Hotels
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,J V.,6/2/2024,"Stayed here back in mid January. Great location for this hotel. MRT station right next door down below so it's the perfect launchpad for your Singapore exploration. 

As a Lifetime Titanium member with Bonvoy, I was ""upgraded"" to a higher floor room. Unfortunately, the view was lackluster at best.  There was a large overhang sort of thing like an atrium, and so the city view was quite obscured.  Disappointed with the ""upgrade"" but whatever. I've had much nicer upgrades because of my status with other international Marriotts so ymmv. 

The highlight of the hotel is the excellent Executive Lounge. Breakfast and evening selections were numerous and very tasty.  Both Western and Asian foods were available, and service from the dining room attendants was fantastic. 

Won't hesitate to come back despite the lousy room though. Hotel staff, from downstairs to the 2nd floor lounge were absolutely first-rate.",4,eventservices,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TNMqX0gvjwPVi00GPjmfvg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Rs4JYWamaKy8eogihr1FLQ/o.jpg,Breakfast at the JW; Yummy breakfast offerings,Hotels

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Kahealani W.,9/9/2024,"Beautiful and amazing!
I was in awe of how luxurious the grounds are. The moment you walk in, it smells like sandalwood. The lighting and decor are well thought out and elegant. And the elevators?! Just makes you smile every time the doors open.
The staff is welcoming and so helpful. They do their very best to ensure you stay is comfortable. I asked a bunch of questions about the area, and each interaction was great.
Cleanliness is above expectations. Hotel staff clean rooms thoroughly and ensure you have all the amenities you need. 
The location is perfect. You're a 10-15 minute grab ride away from major attractions. Everything you need is within walking distance. Food, bars, restaurants, sites. A lot within 2km.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Dominic T.,18/1/2024,A serene and beautiful atmosphere which sets the perfect tone for a relaxing holiday. Such great service. They have a a well equipped gym and a beautiful infinity pool overlooking beautiful Singapore. The hotel is centrally located which makes it easy to get around and has a train station next to the hotel which is an added bonus. The best part of the hotel is their breakfast. It's the best hotel breakfast I have ever experienced. So many options and it was all delicious. Service there was top notch. A big shout out to the operations manager Aliff Khan as well as Chef Soo Kok Ann for going out of their way to accommodate us with our dietary option. Highly recommend JW Marriott if you're looking for a classy and relaxing hotel.,5,eventservices,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/g9niA7L-zGJ8WBY0zFGF-Q/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4CtITEAqXiQsUGX_3hBKSg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/01iM_dqL0CbmfCvY7IGg1A/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/i5Ir8tm71y2G2jxjG0ytWg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3Jts_gc9tUJIusJ2ZpUBcw/o.jpg,,Hotels
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Andrew S.,28/12/2022,"EDIT: My previous review remains below, however I will say that this Marriott property ""loyalty and guest services manager"" reached out and apologized that we were unsatisfied with the room, and that she would attempt to find another equivalent room at a higher floor. In the morning we were made aware that our new room was made available, I was a little bit confused as I hadn't made a request to move rooms, nor made aware of any of the details of the move. We were just told to pack, they'd move the luggage, and give us the new keys. Upon arrival, we both immediately noticed that the room was significantly smaller. Like 15-20% smaller, and that's being conservative. At this point I'm a little bit frustrated that we moved from a room with a bad view, to a tiny room with a different view, just 3 floors higher. We then received an email that our room was DOWNGRADED to a deluxe room in order to get a higher floor, with only a $47 compensation for the remainder of the days. What the heck?! That barely covers a single burger off the room service menu here. Following that, we complained and requested an equivalent room rather than a downgrade. This is where the great tour of the JW Marriott occurred. We were then moved to floor 8, where upon entering the third room we were offered, I noticed a very murky almost 'wet-dog' smell. Upon further inspection, I found a lot of stains in the carpet that I assume was either blood or feces. Off the side of the bathtub, there was actual fecal matter--showing the quality of housekeeping in this property. At this point I was exceptionally irritated by the search to find an acceptable room. Fourth time, the manager we were working with personally inspected the room, it was the cleanest of the rooms, but still had what I can only assume is bed bugs ingrained in the carpet. And the AC does not function at all in the last room. We gave up trying after running around, packing and unpacking our belongings over the span of 4 hours --which would've better been spent exploring Singapore instead of wasting our time finding an acceptable room. The only offer we received for the inconvenience was 10,000 Marriott points ($100 US value), up from 7000 points offered after making the staff aware of the state of the third room.

One thing that really irked me is the fact that the loyalty and guest services manager downgraded our room from premier to deluxe, despite having 2 more 'equivalent' premier rooms available immediately, and without my knowledge nor consent. A real 'punch to the face' if you will.


--Old Review--
Very new property. The whole hotel gives me a bit of a grand and fancy property vibe with the esplanade train connection and number of good restaurants on the basement floor. This hotel has a 5-star location, with 5-star equivalent surrounding amenities, and a 5-star hotel exterior design.

The lobby is however very narrow making it prone to traffic jams, the service at the front desk is quite slow. I think the front desk might've not appreciated my late arrival due to an almost 2.5 hour flight delay - because I was placed in a room below the roof line, where pool-goers have a direct line of sight into my room. This is also with a status that supposedly guarantees a room upgrade when available, but for whatever reason we got no upgrade. Every single person I've ridden the elevator up with has been placed on a high floor, except me. Strange. The service staff lacks the warmth and welcome that others are trained to never slack on--After staying at multiple high end hotels (Conrad, Shangrila, Aman, Ritz, etc) I can positively say that JW lacks everything in the hospitality and service that higher end hotels offer. Just as an example--when arriving at the Ritz just down the street we were given a warm welcome and a tour of the facilities, and the were made aware of all of the hotels exits. The only 'welcome' we got was from a staff member who said 'Merry Christmas, by the way the wifi is out - so if you want food, write it down on a sheet of paper'. Yikes. The minibar and room service is horrendously overpriced--even compared to the ritz, the included amenities are very cheap. I noticed there's even paint peeling inside of my room. On the second day I noticed room service hadn't set the bed properly, so the fitted sheet was just laying on top of the bed. The shower drain is absolutely caked in mold/mildew so I have no doubt that they never clean the area properly as well. There's just so many details that make me believe this isn't worthy of a 5 star rating.",1,eventservices,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iTNUjzClvUMykTMKkCutlg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tfFYigY4ki9VTo3_XyTz5A/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HTHhGEgtbmtgIW0qBw8lXQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vMhLcmP1EnvHhFoQi_b9-g/o.jpg,Yikes.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Luzcel T.,25/6/2023,"Spent 4 days here while visiting our granddaughter. We stayed in their family room which has a king-sized bed, as well as a queen-sized sofa bed, which was perfect for a party of 4 with a baby. The check in process was seamless. We requested for a crib and was surprised to see a pouch of baby toiletries, that we didn't ask for. That's Marriott going above and beyond. Unfortunately, we didn't get the side pillows of the crib that we requested from housekeeping who came for our turn down service. I don't know if it was communication barrier. She did have a phone with a translator. Otherwise, the service was excellent. We had access to the Executive Lounge and that did not disappoint. They have a different theme everyday. The 2 days we accessed it, they had Korean and then Japanese. I especially love the noodle counter. They have a good variety of food, from cheeses to gravlox to cold cuts, salads, fruits and pastries. noodle and several main dishes everyday. That is breakfast, afternoon tea, hors d'oeuvres, and evening cocktails. The staff here are very attentive and accommodating. I have to mention, Hazel, who made sure to make us feel at home. Special thanks to Gabriel who gave us wonderful restaurant recommendations. Both were from the Executive Lounge. If you don't have access to the Executive Lounge, still not a problem since there are a lot of restaurants as soon as you step out of the hotel.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Lisa G.,7/1/2025,"We stayed at this property prior to sailing to Thialand, Vietnam and Hong Kong in November 2024!!!

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Patrick P.,14/12/2019,"I'm halfway through my stay here at this Marriott property and I felt compelled to write a review even before the end of my stay because I felt so strongly about the quality of my stay so far.

I arrived after midnight and was immediately greeted at the door by an employee who helped unload my bag out of the taxi and physically walked me to the front desk. I had been flying for the past 24 hours and took 3 separate planes to get here, normally I would take care of myself but it was all I could do was drag myself behind him to check in.

The team at the front desk was cordial, helpful and fast with getting me what I needed to get upstairs as quickly as possible. I travel frequently for work so I have status with Marriott. It allowed me to request an upgrade from my standard room with two twin beds into a corner suite that essentially is about as large as my 2B2B condominium in Chicago. The views are pretty sweet- I'm looking at the famous Raffles hotel and there's even 1.5 bathrooms for me. I'm sure if I had more than one person staying in here we would have use for the main living area as well as the extra half bathroom but I'm not someone who would need any of this.

The bathroom has a full tub and shower with multiple spray options for those who like to take their time getting ready in the morning.

With my status comes access to the Executive Lounge- where there is a daily buffet from 6-10:30 for breakfast, which has just about everything you can think of- very eclectic so there's something for everyone. Local flavors, classic N American style meats, fruits and charcuterie and smoked salmon. Bread, cereal, omelette/egg stations round out your choices. Tough not to overeat and breakfast isn't generally something I usually indulge in. 

They offer afternoon tea service daily from 2:30-5, and hors d'oeuvres from 5:30-7:30 (along with cocktails from 5:30-9:30. The small items they advertise are basically good enough to substitute for dinner. Today they had the bread, salad, fruit station, warm bao with BBQ meat, charcuterie and small bites like burrata with diced tomatoes and basil strips served in shot glasses, and fried shrimp, veggie rolls, and other stuff that anyone can find something to satisfy their desires. 

Also there's  a dessert table with various local delicacies, tarts, and you could hit up the fruit station if you're still hungry. I had a chance to speak 
with Chef Arjun about how great my experience with the lounge food has been, from trying local dishes to various items from the mix of cultures that visit or have immigrated to Singapore. I especially noted to Arjun how much I appreciated the authenticity of the dishes- I tried curried potatoes as a side for breakfast and it was nothing I was accustomed to. He asked if I would be back tomorrow for the cocktail hour because he wanted to prepare something special for me. I'm unfortunately going to be on a bus tour tomorrow night but I'm looking forward to Monday's event just because nobody has ever offered something like this before and it was definitely flattering.

If you need to get local currency, the front desk can accommodate you. I'm sure the concierge can hook you up with whatever you're looking to do here. The hotel is pretty much going to come through wherever, and whenever you need something. 

We are above an MRT station, there's plenty of restaurants and beverage options nearby and you can get anywhere you need to easily. On the recommendation of the front desk associate upon checking in, I downloaded the App: Grab, which is like Uber, Grubhub, Expedia and Ticketmaster all mashed up in one. You can get a car or taxi ride for cheaper than flagging one down. 

I've got just about three nights left, and I am going to enjoy the rest of my stay before flying home to Chicago. 

If you have a chance to pick where you're planning on staying I suggest you consider this property. Newer building, impeccable service, and great location. I'm coming back for certain. And I'll stay longer than five nights so I can adjust to the time change much easier than this past trip. 

Before I leave I'm going to eat at Akira Back's place and treat myself to a fantastic last meal for this visit. 

PS- if you like coffee there's a Starbucks within 50 yards of the front entrance.",5,eventservices,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0RodwdJGiIYEZBeVUwOZIQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5urtj23cYvNXP0E1mGY3UQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/aFPWLmQ5oRHBYseGD7y1MQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pnVofW5iCC3Tkwf_wotXwg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZcCmk1AFNBPnSTicZc3XJw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/U6hJqv5PszmQwAoWE64GMg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QdYLtabsN0LCl2K1g5q3yw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3d8BqPZR3Cx5JBXQhFXtfQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-8G3XM5KnXeyBbVmNTYw0A/o.jpg,"Cool lighting in the elevators; Main living space; View outside one of the windows; Baked beans and a steamed bun with sweet bean paste accompany today's omelette.; Bedroom portion of the suite; Second morning breakfast- rice noodles stir fry, savory route for me; Hors D'oeuvres tonight with white wine.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,PJ C.,4/3/2025,"I know Singapore is expensive but for what we paid the room we had was very small.  We had just spent two weeks in SE Asia staying at seven other luxury hotels and this was the least impressive property.  While stylish the room was small - thus all the mirrors in an attempt to make you think it is bigger.  The bathroom water pressure was weak and the temperature for the water took a very long time to get hot. One plus was the AC was very good.

While some of the staff was friendly and helpful the woman who checked me in was cold and a bit off-putting especially when I asked for an upgraded room as a Gold member (No) and a room on a higher floor (No).  When I asked about the standard 2pm late check-out, again a perk for Gold members, she acted like it was some great act of kindness on her part to perhaps allow this.

Upon checking in we are expecting to be upgraded since my husband has a status with them however since its NDP, they are fully booked. Initially we had a standard king size room but due to some unforeseen issues with that room, we were moved into a much better, higher and spacious room. We couldn't complain since I can say that they really did their best. 

They have two pool area which is located in different floor and building. Be sure to check both of them!

Check in was a breeze. I was walked to my room in the East tower, as it took several elevators to get there. The room was spacious with a great view and luxurious bathroom. The room was supplied with a robe and slippers, and every travel toiletry imaginable. Toothbrush/paste, mouthwash,  cotton swabs, etc. 

Service was great, room was clean and comfortable. It's quite hot in Singapore so I was grateful for good air conditioning. 

My only complaint is that you have to be Marriott Platinum in order to receive breakfast. I would have loved to try their breakfast buffet, but I was not spending $45 to try it when there were plenty of delicious breakfast spots in the area. 

The area is very safe and walkable, I was able to walk to Chinatown, Arab St, Gardens by the Bay, and many malls and restaurants from this location.",5,eventservices,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uF9SNpXGJCFf8fe_NkhpDg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-OkKgb-5WjflnFjQzRYDHg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5dZw39Ievvo_XCt2p4w2cA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TQ3PIfKdme1QnWQCIlCwPg/o.jpg,Gym; Lobby; Reception desk; Pool with a view,Hotels

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Amanda F.,14/7/2017,"We ended up at the JW after our tour company failed us by booking us into the smallest hotel room at another local hotel. My husband cashed in his Marriott points and we ended up here for three nights.

Upon entering the hotel it was beautiful and full of life and class. Our room was upgraded and included a tub, shower, toilet (with fancy things on it to include a butt warmer and bidet), robes, slippers, TV, high-speed wifi, etc. 

The hotel had a full gym to include ellipticals, treadmills, free weights, weight machines, BOB for boxing and kickboxing, stair steppers, etc. Each machine had access to water, towels, and hook ups for phones. The hotel also on the same floor had a pool and a lounge area for reading and or relaxing with a view.

We had a free upgrade to the executive lounge. This allowed access to a full breakfast (fresh coffee that is grounded for my pleasure), appetizers, free alcohol, and tons of eats. One of my favorites was getting something from the chef and smoked salmon. Since Singapore is on the expensive side for booze it was a pleasant surprise to enjoy free drinks ranging from Tiger beer on draft, wines, spirits, and if you are lucky the staff will make your drinks to include the famous Singapore Sling.",5,eventservices,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DS9vEFQ_PF7olBkcEPuOzw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZZFj0OLT1McMJLp6wh8vdA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZeHzRAMZuiZlFsKmtjf4JA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UjpZMBXLys4y0CB_kgFjLA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jk6w6tZTaUOUEXJlNh5Q-A/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WCjodSCt15s4aw2by9eAtw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Z1mDG7gQlCBaD-7SJ-3biA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/50OALzTSGw7WF1n4P9n8Ag/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yZzQAbq9iSDpWtv9Wi_oUg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hGWrUtuDMQi7F76_ztc9aA/o.jpg,Pool with a view; Bed; Food glorious food; Lounge,Hotels

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Jocelyn L.,17/2/2022,"This hotel was fantastic. I would highly recommend it during your stay in Singapore, if it's your first or subsequent time. My husband and I stayed here for a few nights, then spent our last night at the Marina Bay Sands.

Pros of the JW Marriott:
-Great location, close distance walking to several areas including Colonial district, Little India, and touristy things like Raffles hotel, and pretty close to Chinatown. 
-Nice room - great lighting, modern furniture
-Excellent service, from the housekeeping that cleaned our rooms, to the Executive Lounge staff, who greeted and chatted with us like we were old friends!!
-Excellent breakfast at the Beach Road next door, included for Titanium Elites. This was better than most hotel breakfasts I had ever been to!! It included several different Asian dishes such as chicken egg noodle soup, laksa, dim sum (in your own little steamer!), Nasi Lemak, and your typical American favorites like scrambled eggs, truffled eggs, pastries, and fresh fruit. The food was all tasty too! 
-Infinity Pool was quite amazing. It has this killer view, located on the corner of the 18th (?) floor, with the city skyline and Marina Bay Sands in the background. 
-Excellent supply of bottled water, maid service was generous to refill with several bottles each day.

Cons:
-Pool water was very, very ice cold, which felt horrible, even in the hot Singapore heat. Wish it was heated!!! Also, there wasn't much room around the pool for lounge chairs. All they had was some uncomfortable benches, which was quite a bummer. 

Overall, terrific hotel. We stayed here to quarantine straight from Changi, which worked out quite well.",5,eventservices,,,Hotels
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Dan H.,28/5/2019,"Wonderful hotel in terms of hotel itself and services. The decor is very modern and chic (think The Cosmopolitan in Vegas) and things are very organized and clean.  

We had a suite as part of a Marriott awards upgrade and had some issues with the ceiling due to the heavy rains. The staff immediately jumped on this and moved us to a comparable room (although it was a city view vs the great marina view) but offered us some credits into our account for our trouble.

The management team was great here for check in to check out, and the concierge was very courteous and even walked out with us and waiting until our Grab arrived to take us to the airport.

One of the best parts is one of two pools on site. There is one that is covered (so protected from the elements) but still outdoor, and overlooks the Singapore skyline.  This is a must do while you stay here.

The breakfast buffet is very good at the Beach Road Kitchen.  It's not earth shattering, but a good high end hotel restaurant breakfast buffet. 

We would definitely stay here again.",5,eventservices,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ersBpwfF8kGKhau3YQU9vA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Eba5nTLP8Ri-_3POvuiryA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FwVNmIqNQVuSnJERrZbtgQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SVX5TN9GtAXqmO0KvzV8vQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kGjVPainrihTtbXM-vOd1w/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TaBfkrHo_w55zZSHik8QZg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/elGlqSTStesSHw7MKvapeg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/75X6iVtyHFmnIRVR9lZSTA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cWAWm070fJUxW_8x2eXVxw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HZU3Z0qrjxjMm6MLONnKQQ/o.jpg,,Hotels
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,John J.,22/1/2023,"For New Year's, my son and daughter-in-law, and I had a special Buffay dinner at the JW Marriott. I thought the quality of food was disgusting. First prime rib, was cut in small pieces like we were at a Korean barbecue. They use something they called a cereal crust, I have no clue what it was, but it did not taste good. out of the entire buffet, there were a few things I enjoyed, the mashed potatoes, small pork, ribs, and garlic toast. This certainly wasn't a myriad standard. And for the cost it should've been half the price. I strongly suggest if you want a night out at a good quality restaurant, you need to look past this one.",1,eventservices,,,Hotels

Awesome tall lobby, room, pool deck, infinity pool, dining hall.

Located just outside Raffles Hotel, a stone throw away from Arab St civic district, and minutes away from CBD, MBS, Gardens by the Bay.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Sean D.,11/9/2018,"First time in Singapore and second time at a JW Marriott: and they never disappoint. As soon as you walk in, you are greeted with smiles and friendly staff members. They then proceed on how they may assist you. 

As we were getting checked in, a different staff member came over and gave us some calamansi juice (at least that's what I believe it tasted like). Nonetheless it was refreshing. 

We then proceeded up to our rooms. They have some cool elevators there. As the light changes along the walls of the elevator, so does the design; I've never seen that before. The rooms are very modern and everything looked brand new. Tons of mirrors and lighting. A large bath tub with bath minerals. And the shower is like rainfall. Also, there's a volume control in he bathroom so that you can hear the what's on the TV. The bed was very comfortable and we slept like a baby. 

They have an infinity pool on the 18th floor, lounge, and a gym. The pool offers amazing views and is worth checking out.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Michael R.,21/1/2018,"The JW Marriott Hotel Singapore is a relatively new hotel in the new South Beach area which is across from the Suntec convention center. It's also quite close to the CBD. The JW is a modern hotel with all the amenities for a great stay. 

I took the hotel car service from Changi airport and it was punctual even with a longer than expected wait at immigration. Upon arrival I was greeted by Amanda who whisked me and my bags to my room to avoid a line at the front desk where she handled the check-in in private, which after a long flight from Tokyo was much appreciated. 

My room was bright and modern was designed for function. While not as large as many hotel rooms in which I've stayed in Singapore it never felt small. Housekeeping did an impeccable job throughout my entire stay and on the weekend turned my room when I was in the lounge for breakfast. 

The Executive Lounge at the JW was exceptional. With a wide array of eastern and western choices one was easily able to find something to eat. The breakfast service also included made to order omelettes and chicken or pork soup. The lounge had 3 food presentations daily, so very easy to grab a bite. 

I also visited Akira, the Japanese Restaurant which was also quite good, although at a slightly higher price point than the average restaurant. There are also a few good bars at the JW including 'Tonic' which is a 'must go' bar for gin lovers. I'm glad I'm coming back to the JW tomorrow as it's definitely my new go to hotel in Singapore.",5,eventservices,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JSVHQW_Q0DpGd_H0aIRSTA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Oq50ECauVNnxBxSJABuOZA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Y467NoRtgJUbCNSaMxQTgQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sGRX0natCNbS44fWyDY1_w/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YcK-V9cJvFs88rLDLnNNeQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ecKiy6uH99tF3z973MfW-Q/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/U7VrbmsBmForf11ykV4VNw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gSlXbAUF0XkZaJ0UBnCzBg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QKEhquMSBpJp84aPpQYoOQ/o.jpg,Hallway to my room; Nice bath space; Room..very well organized and bright; Tonic...THE place for gin; Across from Suntec; Executive Lounge; Executive lounge; Front Entrance,Hotels
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Melissa P.,6/2/2018,"Impeccable hotel! After arriving early in Singapore from a nonstop flight out of San Francisco, the hotel accommodated my early check in with no issue - albeit I was on a low floor and did not get a king as requested. 

All the staff encountered here were friendly and willing to help. For a JW Marriott, the decor is much more trendy and modern than you'd expect. The room was small but that was a non issue - the bathroom is beautifully designed with a soaking tub, separate shower room with rain shower from the ceiling and a ""Tokyo-esque"" toilet. My only complaints were no outlets in the bathroom, and the mirrors in the room are darkly tinted which looks cool, but makes it a little hard to see yourself when getting ready. I ordered room service once during my stay, the menu was pretty limited, but the club sandwich was good.

The club lounge here is the absolute best I've experienced compared to any other Marriott with a great selection of food options, both eastern and western. There are breakfast, afternoon tea, hors d'oeuvres, and evening cocktail hours. It also has business meeting space and a computer with printer if needed. 

The spa does not post their prices online, but I emailed an appointment request and got a quick reply with a price sheet. Hotel guests also get $30 off spa treatments. I had a great treatment and enjoyed the steam room and sauna pre facial and the zero gravity relaxing chair area post facial. It was a bit pricey and they pushed their product packages at the end but it was an excellent facility - highly recommend.",5,eventservices,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3jwhgUt07r_wkqwOz_t9MQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/riM_yI8Wp2HKDyLIbvFUxQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/j_agUCuvcZ050EoCWIWVWA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uPlqVVPIAWqL33F1RoIPcw/o.jpg,Spa at JW pricing; Spa at JW pricing; Spa at JW pricing,Hotels

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Jason P.,23/2/2018,"I stayed here for three nights during my second visit to Singapore and had a lovely stay. 

We had arrived on an early United flight and got to the hotel around 10 AM. Our room was not available just yet so they let us leave our bags and visit the executive lounge for breakfast. The lounge is the best executive lounge I have ever seen at a Marriott. It blows the lounge at the JW in Mexico City and Kuala Lumpur out of the water. They had pastries, all sorts of cured meats and cheese, all sorts of fruit and fruit juices, a cereal bar, a dim sum section, and a made to order omelette station. 

After breakfast our room was ready and we were quite impressed by the size. We easily fit a roll away bed inside. The decor was very modern but I found that all the tracked rolling mirrors were frustrating at times. For instance, the bathroom mirror slides away into the bedroom which seems kind of pointless. This feature just allowed lots of noise to leak from the bathroom into the bedroom. Otherwise everything else was top notch: smart toilet, rainfall shower, automated blinds and curtains. 

Aside from the room I also spent a good amount of time at flow 18. They have a ping pong table, bar, pool table, and infinity pool up there. The view from the infinity pool is really pretty at night but unfortunately the pool water is quite cold since it is often in the shade and not heated. It is a little uncomfortable to lounge in which is quite a pity...

I want to note that the concierge was extremely helpful. I had bought city pass tickets for the wrong date (one week in advance doh!) and they were on the phone for over a half an hour deciphering what needed to be done. 

If you have Marriott gold status this hotel is an excellent choice and a strong upgrade from the Marriott on Orchard road.",5,eventservices,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BN6hH6lKgjovKd5pdNYpXA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HSi8SSPy0SJuuiSUU11GRg/o.jpg,,Hotels
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Kevin Z.,27/9/2017,"Hands down the best hotel I have stayed at period! I have stayed at thousands of hotels throughout the world and this is by far my favorite. From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave you are treated as you're an elite status person. 

Upon arriving and entering into the property there is a giant screen w/ a constant movie image straight out of tie dye from the 70s. Then entering into the registration area you see the class that the hotel has to offer. The staff was very friendly and it wasn't just the person I spoke w/ upon check-in, but EVERYONE on property. The check-in process was easy and quick. As we made our way to our room we entered the elevator and we noticed that the elevator changes light colors. 

Upon entering our room, my gf immediately got mad. Not because of the way the room looked, but because of how it looked. She had paid for us to stay one night at the Marina Bay Sands at $500 (see my review). We got more bang for our buck staying at this property than over at MBS. Within the room we were given 2 bottles of water complimentary. The bellman that helped us w/ our bags, showed us all the features to the room which was maintained from the television. From the curtains to the temperature to the tv itself. The rooms are newer so it has the USB plugs as well as the traditional ports.

The pool is located on the 14th floor if I recall. It's a small infinity pool w/ chairs in the water. It offers a view of downtown to which you can see the Marina Bay Sands, amongst other sites.

The main stand out for me was their Executive Lounge. Hands down the best lounge I have ever been too. This includes airport AND hotel lounges. In the lounge they offer not only your typical items, but pieces of sushi, a variety of fruits, veggies, snacks, candies and numerous other items. Not to mention a bar that has beer on draft! On top of that we were unable to have breakfast the next morning due to our early flight. The staff was kind enough to prepare a to-go breakfast for us.

The hotel is close to all the tourist sites. Singapore also has Uber which was easy to use from our hotel. 

If you're planning to stay anywhere in Singapore, I urge you to stay here. You won't be disappointed in any aspect. Amazing all around!",5,eventservices,,,Hotels
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Khiang S.,9/5/2017,"This is my new fav hotel in Singapore. 2nd stay and 1st time reviewing it. Fairly new hotel, about 7m old as of this writing. It took over another hotel that didn't do well. 

Let's start from the hotel's road entrance. The entrance is located along nicoll highway although the address is 30  Beach Rd. This is probably one of the most confusing thing about the place. Uber, Grab, taxi don't know where to go if you say JW Marriott South Beach. This location is simply South Beach and the sign at the entrance on nicoll highway reflects that. The JW Marriott sign is on the hotel and half way up the building. The structure is remarkable and easy to identify so most times, I would point to it and tell the driver to drive in that direction. 

The main door of the hotel is in a cul de sac with a bowl of overflowing water. Around the bowl are quotes about water, including ""be like water ....."" - Bruce Lee. How cool is that?

Inside the entry is a huge digital display that has artsy design constantly swirling around. I saw a lot of people taking photos in front of it. I would suggest a video instead. 

Turn right and immediately left to see the front desks. It is long and during the day, it is filled with staff. Everyone I have met is so friendly. They greet you with a smile as you walk by them. Very good service. Always helpful. 

The decor is very comtemporary and nice. I did not like how the walls are painted. initially I thought they weren't, that it is dirty and waiting for a final coat of paint. I got use to it by the end of my stay. The lighting in the elevators changes and with each change, the pictures on the sides changes. 

The rooms - I had a room on the 21st and 15th floors. The first room faced raffles hotel, the second faced suntec. Views at these levels can't go wong but I do keep the shades closed as it can get warm with the sun shining in. 

High tech! That's how I would described the rooms. The curtains and shades are controlled by switches on the wall next to them or if you are a geek, use the tv with the remote. I bet you can spend 15 mins just playing with the curtains and shades. 

The SmartTV is also cool. I like the relaxing playlist. If you leave the tv on when you leave the room, it will start back up when you enter the room. Can be annoying as the volume auto goes back up. Also if it was on a playlist, it will likely have reached the end of that playlist and loops on that last song. You will need to go back to the category and then back to playlist to select the first song if you like to start from the beginning. 

The bed and pillows are very comfort. Everything in the room is shiny. Lots of reflective surfaces around the room makes it look huge. I love the couch by the window for reading.  Ample space to hang up your clothes. Not enough drawer space for me. There were 2 and smaller than usual. In between the two drawers is a drawer safe. Initially I had a hard time figuring where to put my suitcase and eventually found a smaller closet near the door. The wall paper covering made this closet ""disappear "" - think Sherlock Holmes. Anyway, hotel staff has access to this area as this where you would put your shoes and dirty clothes for laundry services. How neat is that?

Bathroom - you need to find it. the door leading into the bathroom is a huge mirror as well. The bathroom is gorgeous with the soaking tub. A separate toilet and shower means no need to fight over the use of the place, if you don't mind some soaking outside while you take a dump or vice versa. The toilet bowl is ... high tech too. The cover automatically opens when you approach it. The seat is heated. After you are done, the bidet can be customized for up to two users. Anyway, just try it. Shower room has spray as well as a rain shower head from the ceiling. There are two controls. The top control diverts water to the spray or the ceiling or Off. The bottom control controls the temperature. There is a small button on the control. To get hotter water,  press that button down before turning. It will allow you to increase temperature past the ""comfort"" zone.  The one complain about the bathroom is that there are no hangers! I had to drape the wet towel used after my showers over the soaking tub. There is a stool in the bathroom where housekeeping put the fresh towel each day. Other than that no hooks. 

Since I'm a club member, I had access to the lounge. No need to repeat what others have said. Service and space are amazing! I recommend the rendang omelet and the local selections are quiet good too. During my stay of 7 days, I have had most of my meals here. I did not see any waffle station mentioned in other reviews.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Lawrence D.,22/9/2019,"My go to hotel in Singapore as it is close enough to downtown but in route to Changi business park (15 minutes away) where I work.

Rooms are always clean, bathrooms are great with smart toilets, sheets are always crisp and ironed.  Gym is a bit small but better than most I've tried in Singapore.  The marriott lounge breakfast is AWESOME.  Eastern and Western options, omelette stations cold cuts, fruit assortment fresh juices.  They have everything you need.  

Only issue with this hotel is the wait for a Taxi.  Not sure why they haven't solved this but give yourself 5-10 minutes each morning to wait for a taxi.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Cassy H.,27/6/2019,"Where to start when you review a JW Marriott?? The service, the ambience, the food, the staff, the rooms, the location ??  

Location?? Incredible location with amazing views of the city.  They really maximized everything about this spot.  The 18th floor pool, spa, lounge areas, game spot and bar really hit the spot.  The views from the top are awesome.  

Service?? Staff?? The staff is beyond helpful, warm, greeting. They go out of their way to say hi, ask if everything is well, bring things as you need them....overly accommodating in every way.  Reuben at the front desk was especially helpful the night we checked in.  Everyone seemed to remember us and our names as we came & went thru the lobby.  It was refreshing to feel so personal with the staff here.

Food?  There are quite a few dining options in the South Beach square that are affiliated with the hotel.  The restaurants in the NCO club are wonderful.  The Beach Kitchen was good as well.  Harrys and Alchemist are great for drinks and quick bites.  Having a Starbucks there is a lifesaver for us Americans that crave our Sbucks!  We got room service for late night breakfasts and it was good.  Once it came up cold, but was still good.

Room?? Our room was big and spacious.  We got a corner spot that was awesome!!! Huge floor to ceiling windows, giant bathroom...loved it.  Very high tech!

Cannot recommend this place enough!",5,eventservices,,,Hotels
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,George L.,10/5/2019,"Staff was absolutely wonderful, the hotel was beautiful.

The room was clean, and cleaned daily. They were attentive and detailed. 

The concierge lounge is one that other hotels need to take note of. There were fresh fruits, juice, and food. The mix from east to western style foods was great for all tastes.

Rooftop bar has amazing views, some views are cutoff but still good. Definintley bring swimwear and enjoy this area.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Nicole D.,23/8/2018,"This is a beautiful property.  Modern decor, comfortable room, fantastic shower and bath (despite the fact that there's no PLUG in the bathroom .... )  Great location.   

Everything you would expect from a JW Marriott.  Comfortable, beautiful, no wear and tear.  Where this property excels is service.  I arrived late at night and needed cash to pay my taxi driver.  The front desk agent walked me to the cash machine and took me through the whole process.  Did I need the help?  No.  Did I appreciate it?  Yes.

The service was incomparable.  

Breakfast in the main restaurant was over the top great.  Every type of cuisine you could want.  All fresh and delicious.  Same with the Executive Lounge ... a fantastic selection, amazing service (wish I could remember the name of the woman who served us, she was delightful!) large and comfortable.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,John W.,9/8/2018,"Our family of five traveled once more to Singapore to stay at the JW Marriott...AGAIN! We had such a wonderful experience the first time that we knew that this hotel would go above and beyond to make our stay wonderful. 

The facilities are breathtaking, from the pools to the concierge lounge, to the hotel rooms. However, our favorite part about staying at the JW Marriott is its incredible service. We would especially like to thank Ann for making our college-bound daughter feel welcome to Singapore, Hazel for always welcoming us into the lounge with a smile and a hug, Melvin for constantly checking in on us, and Yoges and Zach who made our stay great with their excellent service and hospitality!

We highly recommend staying at this wonderful hotel located in the heart of Singapore and can't wait to return.

Pros: 
Above subway MRT stations
Breathtaking infinity pool view of the city center 
Many many many eateries within 10 min (from clean comfortable budget to Michelin rated restaurants) 
Hip and trendy decor 
Great people
Superior breakfast buffet - make sure you book a package with breakfast
Centrally located

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Julie L.,18/7/2017,"We have stayed in many JW Marriott Hotels around the world, but this one takes the cake as our best hotel experience in anywhere. 

There are several reasons for this. Firstly, the hotel is brand new, with the latest technology and chic rooms. Though the rooms were not large by US standards, it was very well-thought out. Our corner room 2016 had a fantastic view of the CBD (Central Business District) and a lovely view of the Marina Bay. We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands the last time we visited. It was crowded and impersonal. 

Secondly, the location is very convenient to shopping and dining. Across from the Suntec Mall, not far from the CBD (Central Business District) and Chinatown, and walking distance to the Marina Bay and Esplanade. We had lots to do in the area, but it was not difficult to get to other parts of the island with the subway train either. It was a beautiful and upscale part of town.

Last but not least, it was the staff that makes this place a gem. From the bellman to the front desk to the Executive Lounge, everyone was friendlier than the other. I'm an SPG Gold Member, so after Marriott merged, I became a Gold member with Marriott as well. We were able to frequent the Executive Lounge for Breakfast, Afternoon Tea, and evening Cocktails. Ann Margareth, Angela, Matin, Ken, and Chee Yean all went out of their way to make our visit memorable. Besides the Executive Lounge, Aaron from the front desk and Angie at the Valet were also outstanding. Honestly, every one we met were well-trained, courteous, and extended the Asian Hospitality in a very genuine way.

We will definitely return!",5,eventservices,,,Hotels

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Christopher D.,10/6/2017,"The service from the team here at the JW Singapore was outstanding from start to finish.

As a Platinum Premier, Marriott has been very good to take care of me on most of my hotel stays.  This specific hotel went above and beyond with regards to making sure I had a good stay.  For starters, they reached out over a week in advance to see if there was anything they could assist with prior to arrival.  They were also kind enough to upgrade the room to a beautiful suite far in advance.  Certainly unexpected, but more than appreciated.

Our arrival was late night due to the Singapore Airlines flight from Sydney's arrival.  We checked in around midnight.  Being that time, the hotel was of course quiet.  It was the perfect time to take in this wonderfully designed, modern hotel.  Check in was swift and efficient, with just the right amount of information.  Given our late night flight the next day, they also offered a late checkout, which we enjoyed because we wanted to see the light show at the Gardens By The Bay where the ""super trees"" are.

Room was amazing, VERY high tech, incredible comfortable and well designed.  Walk in closets, coffee bar, two bathrooms, double sinks in master, all electronic curtains and blinds, temperature controls and most hotel services are all on the television as well.  Note: Not for the technically challenged (my parents would not even get the lights on).

Lounge access the next morning for breakfast...also amazing.  Staff available to assist at ever corner, great food selections including a omelet chef, it has something for everyone.  We also took advantage of the afternoon cocktail hour and grabbed some food because our flight departed at midnight.

Rooftop pools, there are two.  We enjoyed the view from the 18th floor and relaxed without many guests.  There was also a gymnasium on this level.

No lack of service anywhere at this hotel.  Extremely friendly and every single employee said ""hello"".  Not kidding, EVERY single one.  Two gentlemen outside in the sweltering heat washing windows even stopped mid-task to say hello.  

I wouldn't hesitate to book this hotel on my next visit to Singapore.  They have everything I need and again, the service was incredible.",5,eventservices,,,Hotels
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,John M.,13/2/2018,"Let's start by saying the JW Marriott has set the bar for excellence so high, I don't want to stay in another hotel again...let me explain.

I travel a decent bit and have a hard enough time deciding which hotel chain to commit too in a steady relationship. This JW Marriott in Singapore has more than won me over and assured me I made the right choice.

From the most accommodating and professional staff on the planet (not an exaggeration check my creds) to making the experience of traveling rewarding again, I cannot say enough positive things.

Checkin was beyond easy even with my early arrival (9AM) where the staff understood the whoas of flying and jet lag impact on even a simple hello on my part. I was able to get a shower and eat from the most brilliant breakfast spread in the Executive Lounge allowing me to step right into Singapore with a smile and level comfort seldom felt.

I could keep writing for hours on the truly inspiring experience I've had at this JW but I challenge anyone to prove me wrong and stay here.",5,eventservices,,,Hotels
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,chris m.,3/3/2019,"My perspective is that of a business traveler.  Been coming to Singapore for 30 years, and have a certain level of expectation for a high-end hotel in this city.  JW Marriott just did not make it, and I'm a Platinum member, so I was really surprised and disappointed.  Checked in online, so the hotel would know I was coming.  Lots of warmth at the reception area, which was nice.  Open the door to my room: two single beds.  I'm only 6' tall, and my feet hung over the end of the bed.  Too tired after the flight from Europe to argue, just went to sleep.  Next morning, I requested a change: king bed, higher floor, a view.  Got all three, in a room that was actually physically smaller than the first night.  

As for the Executive Lounge, it seemed like it was open to anyone who was smart enough to go to the second floor, and walk across a breezeway.  Place was absolutely packed.  Perhaps there really were that many qualified guests, but who knows? No one ever asked for a room number or anything.

I will give props to two places in the general South Beach center: the Beach House Kitchen has a great breakfast buffet, and the Starbucks on the ground floor is very nice.

But the hotel?  I will likely not return.",3,eventservices,,,Hotels
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Rehana A.,4/5/2018,"Two words, Fancy and impressive. I was here for business. Thank God. Personally, I don't think I will stay on my own dime. They staff here is outstanding. They are so accommodating and friendly.  I checked in and went to the evaluator, which I must say was extremely cool. I love the new colors and background. I couldn't help but take photos.  My bed was extremely comfortable, and bathroom was so impressive. It's controlled by a remote control. The bathtub was huge. You get some awesome toiletries unlike other hotels. 
  I got the privilege of going to the business lounge. The amazing fruit juices and fresh cooked food and fresh local fruits, it's just amazing. I tried Jumbu (rose apple) at the lounge and I was looking forward to it every day.  I also ordered room services and only stuck to the local foods. They were catered to the American taste buds and took the spice out of it. Nonetheless, it was delicious. 
  I was big fan of the rooftop pool where you can watch the view of Singapore and take my coffee and head up there to see the Sun. Overall amazing stay.",5,eventservices,,,Hotels

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Annie N.,25/7/2018,"The hotel itself is really beautiful and the staff here are wonderful, it would probably have been five stars in my opinion if we didn't have a few hiccups with check in, we had requested for a 2:00 checkin and arrived at 1:50 the room wasn't ready and we were asked to wait by the pool area which we didn't mind but when we finally got our room we were given the wrong room and it wasn't the two beds that we requested, instead we received one king and it was on a low floor so we had no view. My friend had to go down and request a room change thus making us wait some more after we just got off the plane and waited over half an hour for this first room. Honestly I just wanted to shower and change but since we had no choice we decided to go out and explore, big mistake cause it was really hot outside and I was definitely not in the right attire since the hotel had our luggage's. When we got back we were finally given a room with two beds one floor higher(still no view) but at least we finally had our beds. The bathroom is gorgeous with so many mirrors a soak tub and a rain shower as well as a Japanese toilet (very much appreciated since my friend tends to bomb the toilet and this toilet comes with a deodorizer) I can finally use the bathroom after 20 minutes instead of 2 hours. The beds were really comfortable and the pillows are amazing we couldn't stop raving about how comfortable they were. The pool is on the 18th floor with a nice view and a gym as well, room service has been so sweet they come by asking if you need anything, this one girl even gave me chocolate you can tell this hotel prides itself in their amazing service as the staff remembers each guests names and if they see you they always stop to say hello. If only we had a nicer view and didn't have the issue with checkin this would be a 5 star review",4,eventservices,,,Hotels

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Chris H.,6/2/2017,"I think that this hotel has quickly climbed to near the top of my favorite hotels list. I spent a couple of nights here just a little more than a month after they opened and absolutely loved it. I stayed in a suite and the bedroom was in the corner of the building with a wonderful view. The bathroom had a full shower and a wonderful soaking tub, also with a wonderful view. Not sure I want to go into why I loved the toilet...but lets just say I did. Exercise facilities were also some of the best at any hotel. It has a pool, bar, ping pong table on a floor that is open all of the way around. It is not on the rooftop...but is on one of the higher floors. My only disappointment was at breakfast. Don't get me wrong...breakfast was great with different ""stations"" built around various types of food. The only disappointment there was the waffle/pancake station. It wasn't maned so the only choice were cold waffles that were cooked long before I arrived there. It was probably because I had breakfast pretty early each morning to beat the crowds. I imagine that it is maned most of the time. I won't even take the time to talk about how wonderful there service was and the great location.

Changi Airport Singapore,Jolie F.,15/1/2025,"If you have to get stuck at an airport- then this is the airport that you want to get stuck in.  This airport offers everything you need, including entertainment.  At this airport you can shop till you drop with all the high-end offerings.  Plus you can be entertained by movies, water fountains, butterfly gardens and more.  They even had a hello kitty exhibit during my visit.  Plus, once you are tired from shopping, you can catch at a nap at a hotel within the airport so you don't even have to even leave security.  If you have a long layover, you can catch a night of sleep at the crown hotel next door, better than the hotel within the aiport, and go on a free tour offered by Singapore.

Changi Airport Singapore,Lea P.,1/12/2024,"Last I heard, Doha's Hamad International Airport has surpassed Singapore's Changi Airport as the world's best. Although I haven't yet visited Qatar, I recall that Changi had undergone several changes the last time I was there. One standout feature is the massive vortex waterfall, surrounded by lush greenery--it's truly a breathtaking sight inside the airport. Beyond that, the airport feels more like a huge shopping mall, with restaurants at every turn. There's so much to do that you could easily spend a night or two there! In fact, they offer a hotel called Yotel, where guests can enjoy flexible check-in and check-out times. The airport also has a variety of activities, some of which require an entrance fee.

Changi Airport Singapore,Steph C.,31/12/2024,"I'm always late getting to the airport because I feel like a sucker when I'm there too early, an hour of boredom my reward for responsible adult behavior. This would not be true if every airport were like Changi. This place is practically an amusement park. I could spend days here without running out of things to do.

My husband and I were only in Singapore for about 36 hours, but we decided to spend a few of them hanging out at the airport before our flight home. We arrived almost four hours ahead of our departure and that was just enough time to accomplish everything on our list.

We checked in for our flight and dropped off our luggage, then headed over to Jewel, the enormous mall attached to the airport by a tram and a long walkway. Jewel's centerpiece is the Rain Vortex, the world's largest indoor waterfall. It's a spectacular sight at the heart of the mall, with all the shopping, dining, and other entertainment built around this giant pillar of falling water. We only looked at it for a few minutes, but we might have walked the trails surrounding it if we'd had another hour to kill.

We grabbed an early dinner at Jumbo Seafood, where I ate an entire chili crab. I gather there are about a thousand dining options at Changi, but I felt I chose correctly. It was the best airport meal I've ever had.

Afterward, we made our way back to the airport side. We were flying Singapore Airlines out of Terminal 3, and the place was beautiful, huge and pristine, with high, elaborately constructed ceilings. There was some kind of Sanrio celebration going on, with decorations everywhere we looked. These included the largest Hello Kitty I've ever seen, welcoming travelers into the terminal.

We had some last-minute shopping to do, and had no problem finding souvenirs for our kids and niece. There was a vending machine that sold toy Singapore subway trains and I picked up a few merlion stuffies from the Kaboom toy store. I also browsed one of the many duty free shops just to try on a Chanel lipstick.

At some point, we utilized the SilverKris Lounge. This was a fantastic lounge, but it was also almost wasted on this airport, where lounging was low on our agenda. I was too full of crab to take advantage of the impressive buffet, but it was nice to sit down for a bit.

We left enough time to visit the butterfly garden on our way to the gate. Unfortunately, the butterflies were sleeping at eight at night (I guess even Singapore can't keep butterflies awake for tourists), but the garden was pleasant, and we got to see dozens of chrysalises on display, some of them twitching with emerging butterflies.

We only went through security after all of these adventures, at a small, efficient station set up at our gate. Changi is the only airport I've heard of that has security checkpoints at every gate. This was an unexpected convenience, one last luxury before we got on our plane.

I'd heard that Changi was the best airport in the world, but honestly, that doesn't quite capture the extravagant splendor of this place. I hope to visit again and maybe see a movie at the free 24-hour theater, or stay at one of the on-site hotels. Even with a short layover, I'd be sure to hit Jewel for Jumbo Seafood and the Rain Vortex.",5,hotelstravel,,,Hotels

Not only is this the most beautiful Airport in the World (Voted upon by the travel industry) but the modern Lounges and the Airport hotels make this the most convenient place to stay if you have a long layover ( 16 hours for me) I don't mind at all.   I just walked through this massive layout, with 4 huge terminals to explore.    

Lots of hidden gardens, magical and whimsical in so many areas of all four terminals, lots of kids' play areas, and massive amounts of great food vendors throughout.  
In addition, if you're so inclined to do some High-end shopping all your Bougie designer's can be found here.   Lots of duty free stores for last minute purchases as well.  

Sorry LAX, you're nowhere near this level of comfort yet.  Keep trying!",5,hotelstravel,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gbFnkDCTsQa1mEX7Syax8g/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HxrPSGH-uvDsMVFW_PQRoQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Cs7W5Iqec2G1_A496AbqZA/o.jpg,"Singapore Changi Airport; Changi Flower Displays; Year of The Dragon 2024, Changi Airport Terminal 3.",Hotels
Changi Airport Singapore,Miok C.,10/4/2025,"So many people. I got a little bit lost around the terminals. I did get there early. Terminal one is where you need to be if you want to go shopping and see the jewel. It was beautiful. 
Get there early if you want to see everything. 
Good luck",4,hotelstravel,,,Hotels
