Cloud Forest,Janet Y.,15/12/2024,"If you even remotely like flowers and nature, then this is a MUST SEE! 
I love flowers and plants so I was blown away by the sheer beauty of how everything was so beautifully laid out. This is an indoor attraction, kinda like a giant greenhouse so it's actually a nice escape from the humid hot mess outdoors. There is a man-made waterfall in the center and it's quite a statement! You follow the pathway to go up and get a great view of the city through the windows. This whole attraction is gram worthy so be ready to take lots of photos and selfies!",5,arts,,,Arts
Cloud Forest,Donna B.,4/2/2024,"Not the Supertree Observatory, the Cloud Forest is a 2 acre greenhouse that's part of the Gardens by the Bay. 

Next door to the Flower, I recommend getting a ticket package to see everything in the area. Staff at the ticket counter were super helpful is getting me the best bundle for every thing I want to see.  Plus advice on what order. 

This huge structure has paved walkways, stairs and escalators, but expect to walk a lot. From ground level you can take your time and wander through the gardens filled with many species of flowers and plants as you work your way to the top of the 35 meter waterfall. It's the world's tallest indoor waterfall. Nine levels, each a different theme- Cloud Walk, Lost World, Crystal Mountain, Tree Top Walk Secret Garden, Cloud Forest Theater, Waterfall View, The Cavern, and Gallery. 

It's the perfect spot to explore during one of Singapore's rain showers.  

I walked over to Gardens by the Bay to explore along the way. But Gardens by the Bay MRT is the closest station.",4,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qoPjOnqehgv-CVxSluTX8w/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ziac7V0XDeO6bzFFoXsFUg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/R5_lhOJQ2PBCUIlwgR0PVA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/u8nqoELma34qViwDMe8jqw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EXR4cbxMQ3qvBzKWU3SGHw/o.jpg,Beautiful flowers; Cloud map; Orchids; So many great colors,Arts
Cloud Forest,Helene S.,2/1/2024,"Get transported into the magical world of Pandora.

The Cloud Forest at Gardens by the Bay created an immersive experience inspired by the movie Avatar. So interesting to see the mystical world brought to life across the iconic cascading waterfalls, beautiful gardens and elevated walkways in the Cloud Forest. 

Separated into five zones, a life-size banshee welcomes visitors to the World of Pandora. Loved the beautiful pathways lit up at night in a splash of colors. 

As you explore each zone, there are docents that operate a puppet baby banshee and baby viperwolf as well as other audio and visual representations of the film. Cute to snap a selfie. 

Other highlights included the cavern with stalagmites and stalactites, the collection of white Dale Chihuly glass and the Orchid Haven. The ""Cloud Mountain"" itself is amazing. It is covered in orchids, ferns, mosses and bromeliads. I bet without the Avatar Experience, it still would have been amazing. 

Afterwards, head to the Supertree Grove for the sound and light show. It is the perfect way to spend the evening at Gardens by the Bay.",5,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/m-2tOuoi6xW3pzDo9v0fYA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MlpY4qxbAUON9UXFCUXcAg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wYlS0Rmi-I9Ur-MwA07ANw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FETZ9IX9MZtoOCWopx1v5w/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yqUoEl08AzGnvXhD7pIYeA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/g2WTF8vwX156qsBnfToeoA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jz9MBZ6GecbMpqlndGA5KQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LOdB0L0g_wS0UuhTFrd0KQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ad4rJx4KJRA0C13MEzvrgg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eif5iOilzPl09U6DDQci7A/o.jpg,Cloud Forest; Avatar Experience; Avatar Experience; Avatar Experience; Avatar Experience; Avatar experience; Avatar Experience at Gardens by the Bay; Avatar Experience; Avatar Experience; Avatar Experience,Arts

Plus if it's hot or rainy, this is especially good bc it's enclosed and air conditioned.

Cloud Forest,Robert W.,17/8/2024,Amazing multi level multi sensory experience at Cloud Forest by the Marina Bay gardens. Every hours there is mist the is sprayed created a cloud like environment surrounding you. It can get quite busy. I suggest coming at night as it's a bit less busy and you also get a different experience with the lights and mist contrasted by the outdoor darkness. It's conveniently located right by the marina bay gardens where you can also catch the outdoor light and sound show by the giant tree forest.,5,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gsiiUXko3anDcXDk0EH03g/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ibQ8kVfQkCj8assbOG8HUg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VUZrh745pIdl_H4BGfLpZA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CnovvLL7T-qHfkTTYDpMGg/o.jpg,,Arts
Cloud Forest,Harun R.,4/6/2024,Honestly this is a great place to visit. To get there you might have to walk a bit of a distance in mostly hot and humid weather.  Inside the natural air-conditioning will be a huge blessing. The beautiful tall waterfall and the walk down from the top.  Unfortunately it is a popular route and you have to work your way between people taking pictures.  Stop at any point and enjoy the view from the inside and outside.  Also to enjoy the flora and fauna all around you. It's a great place to to visit and I highly recommend it.,5,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CIxD2ni1nrYhIBIO9_kcOA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/L4pEmY_nKkdfb71QU9pzKQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qzN5cVqOPhI3JnZ2awW8ew/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hdQEId_3c-vUBmDU9GvSFQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fBTkzdwcGcE5sM2ryuAm1g/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/L030J7TQY_cPTSzpV46ifA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6Idb5aVt1CBK0E5Yd10YlQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-RU9lgBWtS45I-Ove3GxtQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zRVJA1l5a8uOCOovUql0BQ/o.jpg,,Arts

Cloud Forest,Jesse V.,13/9/2023,"This place is amazing. You can find cloud forest inside of Gardens by the bay. You will need to purchase a ticket to go inside of Cloud forest as well as Flower Dome.
It's multiple floors of nature with an Avatar theme, which makes it really cool.
You can send an hour in there just walking around, taking pics, and being in awe.

Cloud Forest,Jacky C.,9/6/2024,"Visiting botanical gardens are not really my thing, but because of how hot it is in Singapore, it was a nice 2 some hour break from the heat in a temperature controlled greenhouse. There is a lot more to offer than the exotic plants itself, as there's a waterfall upon entering the facility. You can get amazing views of the surrounding areas as you ascend to the top and make your way down. It gets crowded so if you're looking for photo ops, going to need some patience.",5,arts,,,Arts
Cloud Forest,William W.,14/7/2025,"While the interior of this modern building is impressive, the crowds are insane! You move at a glacial pace while thousands of people crowd into a tiny space, slowly navigating the exhibits while uncomfortably close to strangers as you climb higher and higher throughout the tour. It's uncomfortable, congested, and you can count on rude tourists attempting to push their way past.

Visitors are much better off going to the Flower Garden next door, a very open, uncrowded space that doesn't funnel its visitors into narrow spaces, where you're free to walk around in an environment with copious amounts of plants.",3,arts,,,Arts
Cloud Forest,Chelsea G.,15/4/2025,"Easily our favorite attraction to visit in Singapore and show friends! 
Things you should know:
I. PARKING
Ordering a grab to get here is relatively easy. I recommend that as your form of arrival and departure so you don't need to worry about parking. Parking has ample spaces available, but I would consider the fee expensive. 
II. SERVICE 
You can buy your tickets online in advance. As for food? I know of a McDonalds on the grounds ~ aside from that... If you want healthy food. I would eat beforehand. 
III. RECOMMENDATIONS
Everything about the gardens is beautiful and well maintained . If I had to recommend what you viewed ~ I would tell you to get tickets for the Cloud Forest and the SuperGrove Tree Observatory. Ideally, you'll want to start at the cloud forest, during daylight hours (17:00-17:30) and then make your way to the SuperGrove Tree Observatory at night. The skyline is most beautifully seen when the sun is down! 
III. CAPACITY 
Avoid holidays here! It gets quite crowded. However, if unavailable, it's STILL worth seeing.",5,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IYyKWN1GHwkJV2fLrMZqWQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/00tjwCtZOizb2zj8eVe5Pg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9l1STygJP-0vi_oRNWmong/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EyCzVHdCwLNJ-ec15Wux6g/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/k-YOLqRgcFxkCQ2mZB3j6Q/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Zw0_BQ7wHeGUhVl5BdlDpA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cw9B79iR5ZrMQIXlQKlTKg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/duXAUagwxfVLRUR5j2ji8A/o.jpg,,Arts
Cloud Forest,PatrickJ T.,7/4/2025,"The Cloud Forest is one of the many attractions that you will find at the Gardens By the Bay in beautiful Singapore!!

It is one very lovely gigantic greenhouse biodome filled with plants and flowers from all over the world!!  Inside the Cloud Forest, you will also witness the largest indoor waterfall on the planet.

Definitely a ""Must Visit"" destination in Singapore!!  This is coming from me who is not a ""plant"" guy.  Photos do not do this place justice.

Cloud Forest,Michael F.,14/10/2024,"You might feel flowered out at some point in Singapore. Regardless. you must made a point of visiting the Cloud Forest. Home to an amazing orchid collection, you'll also find a beautiful waterfall, and immersive digital experience, and multiple floors of temperature control (I.e., air conditioning).

Cloud Forest,Sara C.,7/11/2024,"The Cloud Forest is a glass greenhouse in the Gardens by the Bay, that's full of interesting flora and informative details about the items you're seeing.

Cloud Forest looks similar to its neighbor, the Flower Dome, but i it's higher and more narrow. 

The pièce de résistance of Cloud Forest is the Cloud Mountain in the middle, which is made up of flowers, ferns, and other plant life, and has a beautiful waterfall tumbling down its front.

It's definitely an amazing photo stop and Insta-worthy, along with the super cool info you can learn - so definitely worth a stop if you're already exploring the Gardens by the Bay!",5,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bVWcXQTNEZAL_dvjNAD5bw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VlEzTHwdnv9hKaEcw3Q9YA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NZkwBpqNSoSoX4k6zLAIPg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/85dnlH_4rEOgi1UJSk0CTg/o.jpg,,Arts

Cloud Forest,Mel T.,7/1/2023,"The Cloud Forest is truly a sight to behold. It's everything you see on all those travel shows and more. It definitely lives up to its expectations and is not one of the ""tourist traps"". 

We came by on a Thursday at around 4 pm . We had a combined Gardens by the Bay ticket, which included entrance to the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. We purchased it through Klook, and they have various combo options. I'd definitely recommend purchasing tickets beforehand because the tickets to purchase on site looked like it would take an extra 20 minutes or so. By pre-purchasing, it was a breeze. There was no wait and they just scanned our ticket barcode.

Inside, you'll want to take a pic with the iconic waterfall at the entrance. Luckily, it wasn't too crowded at the time we went, so we didn't have to wait too long. There are different levels of flowers and plants you can take the elevator too. At the time of year we went (September 2022), they were prepping for an Avatar exhibit so it seems like there might be something special going on at certain times if you're lucky enough to catch it. There are a lot of high winding walkways, so just beware if you're afraid of heights. For us, it took about 30 to 45 minutes to walk through and explore everything from entry to exit.

If you only have time for one museum, I would prefer this one over the Flower Dome because this one is much more unique.",5,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HbF1ZvXfp_iZr_yDQdjhZw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8R9jMqQBNJDkYVyZaLI1xA/o.jpg,Top walkway,Arts

Cloud Forest,Roger P.,23/2/2023,"It's really a remarkable feat to have this completely different environment contained inside this bubble. Cloud Forest features a giant waterfall surrounded by hundreds of plants. I purchased our group tickets online as a package deal with the Flower Dome and Floral Fantasy. At the time of visit, they were doing a promotional exhibit with the new Avatar movie.

As you enter, you're immediately greeted by the much cooler temperature and the spray of mist from the waterfall. Because of the Avatar experience, there are a couple of interactive exhibits. The path is designed so everyone only goes in one direction but it'll take you to the top, around the walkways above the waterfall, and then back down. There's elevators and escalators so it's pretty accessible!

Overall, it probably took the group closer to an hour to finish the whole thing. There's a lot of photo spots and it was nice just hanging out inside to escape the muggy heat. This is for sure a tourist spot but worth it!",5,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xiDfHxtj2TSTc4PkdV29Jw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gx4AdfIlByFeOGVma8vewQ/o.jpg,,Arts
Cloud Forest,Christine Z.,22/1/2023,"One of my favorite attractions from my visit to Singapore! Gardens by the Bay is definitely a touristy area, but Cloud Forest is a must-see. Right when you walked in you're greeted by a beautiful waterfall which really sets the tone for the rest of the attraction. I was worried about it being humid with all the plants and watering they must need to do, but it actually ended up being nice and cool. 

During our visit in December 2022, there was a special Avatar display going on here which was interesting, but honestly I think I would've preferred to see the place without it. 

Definitely add this to your list of places to see in Singapore. You can't miss it!",5,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FFU3tA57-ZZYV6_C17jkrw/o.jpg,,Arts
Cloud Forest,Jonathan L.,13/4/2023,"Amazing attraction especially with the Avatar special decorations. Immediately walking in and seeing the waterfall left me in awe. The entire attraction is amazing right when you walk in. I honestly had a hard time telling the difference between the real plants and fake decorations because the real plant life looks so amazing. I can definitely see why the movie Avatar was based off this attraction. 

I loved that it was air conditioned and cool in there. It was amazing getting out of the hot Singapore humidity. Initially I was afraid the Avatar part would be gimmicky and make it boring but I actually enjoyed it. I was able to purchase my ticket using the Gocity pass which allowed me to bypass the lines and also see multiple exhibits for a discount. I highly recommend doing that. 

The entire exhibit takes about 45-90mins to get through depending how detailed you want to be. By far the best exhibit compared to the Floral Fantasy and Flower dome.",5,arts,,,Arts

Cloud Forest,Dean N.,1/1/2021,"The Cloud Forrest is an attraction at the Gardens by the Bay.  It is one of the two domes to explore.  Inside the Cloud Forrest is a huge, and I mean huge, man made water fall.  It is quite spectacular.  There are multiple levels to explore in this enclosure.  It literally feels like walking into a rain forrest and being transported to another planet.  

I came here in the evening and there was something magical about the Cloud Forrest that stood out from the flower dome.  There were stalactites and crystals that you can admire.   If you explore the dome in the day, you will be pleased that it is all AC inside.  

I would suggest to explore the dome both in the day and evening since the natural lighting from outside will change the atmosphere of the dome.

I do have to note, this place was super cold inside the dome! With the big waterfall inside made it worse. It was full on AC and I thought tropical plants needed warmth? This is not for folks with a fear of heights, too! The pathways on top were pretty high up there! Great for picture taking.

Cloud Forest,Jocelyn L.,21/2/2022,"Loved this exhibit probably the most out of the whole Gardens by the Bay. You walk in, and are welcomed by this HUGE indoor waterfall. What an entrance!!!!

You end up walking up a bit, through this indoor botanical garden, but it's quite different from Flower Dome. Here instead, it's greenery all over the walls, covering pretty much every square inch. It's quite impressive. After walking up a path, you have the option to take the elevator, or keep walking. I would highly recommend taking the elevator all the way up to the top floor, then working your way down, either walking or by escalator. You can take your time browsing the various greenery, displayed so nicely, like you are in a forest. 

I also loved the carnivorous plant exhibit towards the top! Really fun reading and seeing the plants that eat flies - so gross but interesting. 

Surprisingly too, the temperature in here was quite cool too, with it being probably around 60 degrees F. If you hate plants overall, the Cloud Forest's cool climate may be enticing enough for your visit as respite from the hot humid Singapore heat.

Cloud Forest,Yuli L.,28/11/2019,"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands so it was a no-brainer to stop by the Cloud Forest because it was within walking distance and came with good recommendations from local friends.  

Upon arrival, we were met with a cool breeze and spray  from an indoor waterfall, a cool  that you won't find often in Singapore. That alone was the worth the price of admission.  We were so Impressed by the variety of tropical plants, the orchids, and the setting of each area.

The skill of the conservation is amazing and is extraordinary.  There are around seven levels to explore with different themes or focus.  I felt like I was in an unreal bubble looking out towards the real world, which also seemed unreal because the whole city of Singapore is an architectural marvel.

The Cloud Forest is an immersive and lush experience that's sure to take your breath away. Right when you walk in, you're greeted by a massive hill of green that houses more plants, exhibits, and a sky walkway.

Highlights of this whole exhibit for me would have to include: the orchid garden and the sky walkway. The orchid garden is small but carefully curated. All hybrids chosen to be displayed are beautiful and have different aromas. Don't be afraid to stop and smell all of them! Additionally, the sky walkway is a seemingly expansive trail above the Cloud Forest that gives you various views around the whole building.

Cloud Forest,Stephen D.,14/1/2019,"Buying a ticket to Cloud Forest feels like buying a ticket to the year 3019. Right from your first step into the wonderfully air-conditioned greenhouse you're instantly greeted by a larger-than life waterfall, ripped straight out of a scene from Avatar. 

Plant people, architecture afficionados, and those on the quest to become/stay Insta-famous will all find a slice of heaven in this modern marvel. The variety of plant species and flowers on display are almost overwhelmingly plentiful. The walkways and supporting structures throughout this mega greenhouse are truly well designed and rival those of science fiction. Finally, there are several platforms to take in views and living walls that make for picturesque backdrops, all enough to make any Instagram addict foam at the mouth. 

Singapore's Cloud Garden is a wonderful place to feel inspired and truly awe struck.

Cloud Forest,Christina R.,20/12/2018,"Wow.  This is hands down the best greenhouse I've ever been to in my life.  

You walk into a cooled building and are greeted with a pretty waterfall surrounded by lush greenery and vivid flowers.  This is enough to make the ticket price worth it as it is a nice reprieve from the heat outside.  

You go through the many levels of plants and see rare flowers that you probably would never see in your lifetime.  There are also cool ""native"" artworks from Southeast Asia interspersed throughout the foliage.  

The best part for me was the surprising ending where they give you information about climate change.  I think the way they did it was very well thought out and not preachy which I believe helps people want to stop and listen.

It may be cheating that I post pictures from inside the dome since you have to pay to go inside,  but if you don't get a chance to go to Singapore and see this you should have a chance to see what you're missing.

Cloud Forest,Mason A.,12/3/2018,"What a work of architectural-nature-artistic elegance! This is worth the $23-28SGD or so entrance fee, and I opted to pay for entrance to the Flower Dome as well, so best in a bundle. 

This dome is beautiful and is perfect for a cool off break from the hot humid Singapore weather. You feel it first as you walk in and observe the fresh huge indoor waterfall. It is cooling, plus there is air conditioning, so if you need I would recommend bringing a light jacket or shawl. The temperature is at least under 20 degrees Celsius I would say.

As you hike up and around the center hill/waterfall you are able to see the various types of plants and species that you would find high up in the canopy of the world's tallest trees. It was really unique and the layout kept you in awe the whole time. There is also a portion which highlights the stalactites and stalagmites which can be found in some caves as well.

Cloud Forest,Melody C.,5/2/2018,"MAGNIFICENT CREATION. so glad I chose to go here instead of the flower dome. I was being a cheapo and didn't want to spend $28 on two conservatories so I just bought a ticket for one conservatory. The cloud forest had lots of plants and trees that didn't interest me at all. But the waterfall and the walkways were mind blowing. 

Once I pulled open that heavy door to the conservatory, a coolness draped over me. The temperature made everything so much more realistic. The waterfall was right by the door and I couldn't believe that I was staring at world's tallest indoor waterfall. Needless to say, it was a mesmerizing sight. There were a lot of tourists taking pictures in front of it but with a distance. I was wondering why. So I went as near to it as I could for my picture and it was then that I understood why. The water splashes and it literally felt like I was taking a shower under it. Call me crazy but I actually really enjoyed that LOL. 

The cloud walk and treetop walk were basically ""bridges"" that went semi around the conservatory. It felt like a death defying experience for me because I could've had a heart attack. I tried my best to walk right in the middle cause the sides didn't feel as sturdy but a lot of people were stopping to take pics and whatnot. There was even a little balcony on one floor. I don't understand why but the balcony HAD HOLES ON THE FLOOR. Like why?!

Take the elevator up to the skywalk for better views, including a cool view of the Marina Bay sands. As you walk through the different levels they have displays and presentations about global warming and climate change.

Cloud Forest,Benjamin B.,10/1/2017,"In the end it's a botanic garden but way bigger and more impressive than everything I have seen up to now. There is a huge hollow mountain in the middle of the dome from which water is falling down and you can feel the spray. On a hot day, this is definitely a cool down. You can take the stairs, or if you aren't too much into walking, the elevator to reach the top and then walk down the trail. In our case it was a little bit too crowded kills the experience a little. Never the less, you can see a lot nature, some great wooden carvings and in the end you learn a little about global warming (it's not annoying, but can cause remorse when you are not treating mother earth as she deserves it)
Comparing both domes (flower and this) I would choose this over the other.

Cloud Forest,David S.,25/7/2016,"I didn't get to check this place out the last time I was in Singapore, so I made it a priority to come here this time, and I must admit that it was well worth the visit. Basically it is an indoor eco-system, with an artificial mountain that is coverved with tropical trees. You can go to the top of the mountain where there are walkways that wind their way down, and they even spray mist to give the impression of a, well, a cloud forest. The basement level consists namely of ecological information pertaining to climate change, and also how they keep this place running through the use of resusable energy and recycled water. Oh, and the first thing you encounter when you step through the doors is what is basically an awesome waterfall. Definately something to check out in Singapore (though I would highly recommend going to the Gardens by the bay in any event).",5,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SqY9k50oQJSzbGe3nAKyBg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tRynYNcdPiV38_1y3b9o8A/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZoEtdtHP3XP6PsTqW5D51Q/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XxHc-RS9sniAW6OBGJMeMg/o.jpg,Flowers; The Water Fall; Plant Formation; From the Upper Walkway.,Arts

Cloud Forest,Chad Y.,21/9/2017,"Wow. 

That is the first word that comes to mind as you enter the Cloud Forest at the Gardens by the Bay. Your breath is taken away as you look up at the world's tallest indoor waterfall and think to yourself ""where the hell am I?""

Am I in Pandora? Did I become an Avatar? No?

I'm still human? And in a cooled greenhouse on the Singapore waterfront? None of this should make sense, but it does and it is an experience not to be missed. 

The Cloud Forest is a really unique experience featuring the upper level vegetation and climates without climbing up 4-5,000 feet. The elevator ride up to the top and the gentle walk down the pathways to the ground level feature a pretty mesmerizing experience of flora and fauna all surrounding this gentle mist of the waterfall. It isn't really much of a hike, but I suppose you could say you did it if you need the exercise points.

While it may seem like a ""touristy"" thing to do, it is far from it...ok, maybe it is, but it is a pretty spectacular sight to see.",5,arts,,,Arts

Cloud Forest,Andrew T.,12/10/2017,"The most important detail? Air conditioned. Or at least, cool, if not also pretty moist/humid. But certainly refreshing after the outside. But for that exact reason, it was a mob scene on a random Tuesday night. The standard people taking selfies and blocking the path and basically just being ignorant of everyone else around them, which drives me nuts.

That aside, this is a pretty cool display. Really cool structure, with some great views of things, both inside an out. I particularly loved the ""top floor"" display of carniverous plants (pitcher plants, Venus fly traps, etc) mixed with Lego versions of the same. Not sure if this is permanent or not, but it was cool.

Also, I know this is not a botanical garden - Singapore has one of those, and it's not Gardens by the Bay - but I do think they could do a better job presenting information on what you're seeing. Information is kind of sparse, and I would have spent more time here and enjoyed it more had there been more information on what I was seeing, more stuff about the ecosystem being represented, and so on. That omission is what keeps me from raving about this.

Of the two (Cloud Forest and Flower Dome) I would say this is the one that's more worth visiting - It's more interesting to me, although maybe without the variety of Flower Dome. But frankly, both are pretty reasonable to get in to, so I wouldn't turn people away from either.",3,arts,,,Arts

Gardens By The Bay,Lyla D.,9/6/2024,"After spending a morning at the Singapore Zoo, where we got glimpses of the famous white tigers, rode a tram around the zoo's 69-acre pioneering open-concept zoo lush landscapes, and watched the amusing trained sea lion performances, a sightseeing stop at the spectacular Gardens By The Bay rewarded us.  The admission fee was S$32 per adult, which was included in our excursion.

We've been to the Gardens By The Bay's Supertree Grove nighttime light show and wandered through both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest during a previous visit, but this time, we got a different perspective of the gardens during the daytime.  We entered the Flower Dome, exploring unique plants native to the Mediterranean region, South African savannahs, and dry, arid deserts.  There were colorful blooming flowers everywhere, and since we were visiting in April, the central exhibit featured Spring-blooming tulips associated with Netherlands-like decor.  The wholly indoor and climate-controlled dome is comfortable to stroll through while admiring the flowers and plants and, fortunately, also provides many as a respite from the sun-scorching outdoor heat. 

As much as I enjoyed the beautiful flowers in the Flower Dome, I preferred wandering through the Cloud Forest, where the world's tallest indoor waterfall flows, and seeing the exotic, tropical, and lush plants found in tropical mountain regions from around the globe from elevated pathways.  We avoided some crowds waiting at the elevators to ascend the waterfall pathway by taking the staircases as we regained our energy by cooling down in the Flower Dome.  While walking down the elevated path, we were well above treetops and could view our next destination in the garden, the Skytree Observatory.

I can't decide which view I prefer between nighttime and day since the gardens look different based on the light source.   But, whenever you choose to explore the gardens, you'll undoubtedly treat your senses to the beauty of Mother Nature.",5,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2ktMC7zfRitgQjLf_ZAU7A/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/a_aiAyrZUH7P-Qz6arF1Yg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/U2lR6oxqSHVroUNzp3KUuA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gkrmWKhUfps2Yxa2uV241Q/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0H0YZKrZuhqC9himTXR_pw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_mIPoAaSOb9zfTq_Xh4VUA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JxWE0d8lVvD51B_L9YQoSw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ysOH0u8T2Ya1nZ4lcVpa9Q/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NOEPZrTa06H4RS3t3tBaZg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CuucSt1_qJ5hS0E3MGJH9g/o.jpg,Golden Garden; La Famille de Voyageurs,Arts

It was hot and muggy... we made it for the first showing at 7:45...   Everyone just lays down on the ground...  without a blanket... on that hard and dirty floor... I'm not a fan so we stood.. while the kids sat down.   It's basically 3 trees that are coordinated to a music medley... of old school jams...  if this is your kind of thing... worth a visit.

The indoor parks are spectacular. The Cloud Forest is more impressive, if you only want to pay for one entrance fee, pick that one. But the price difference between the one and both is not very high, so we went into both.

We went back at night to see the light show in the Super Trees. Definitely worth the trek back to the park. On our evening, the theme was the 1970s, and it was fun listening to that funk and disco music while enjoying the light show.

Gardens By The Bay,Michael F.,29/12/2024,"A must-visit when in Singapore. There is plenty of area to roam and explore for free. Depending on the time you have and money you're willing to spend, there is also plenty more paid attractions such as the Cloud Forest worth adding on.

You'll need to keep in mind that all the free attractions are outdoor and it's always hot in Singapore. They do an amazing job lighting things up at night, so I'd recommend both a morning and evening visit. MRT stops right in the center and it is easy to grab a Grab (their Uber) from a variety of points in the Gardens.",5,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QltU2B-b_WHId5jkyjPG9Q/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RwtcEmZTS7lDXjEjTduSXw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CuKw0of9oxiMWnbvSykxRA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4OoYr4bMfOHR5eMrmTb8-Q/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/n9miexd1zoREAz3I7V3Zsg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eJcT2z_sRi1gHGjRtSmOpA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oXPQSdtiNrNQ0BIk4tPk6A/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TN0gh_cSuKLNKMHeQRSFOA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/y8MzV6-rz_e__TZe8C40GQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tJgqFcRhOiUfNpsy_cl7tA/o.jpg,,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,Christine M.,20/7/2025,"I was in Singapore for a 14 hour layover and had two things on my list - hawker stalls and the new Jurassic World exhibit at Gardens by the Bay Cloud Forest. We went on a Saturday around 2pm and bought tickets there - the line was short and moved quickly. The ticket was $46 and allowed entry to Cloud Forest Jurassic Park and the Flower Dome. This was my first time here so I'm not sure how the Cloud Forest normally is but the Jurassic Park was epic! There were really well done animatronic dinosaurs with a big T-Rex that was awesome. They blinked and moved and had the audio effects too! Took a little more than an hour to walk the whole thing- it was nice since it's a set path that walks you through all the activities. They have a little baby dinosaur you can hold and get pictures with, a TeamLab type projection, a Disney World type part where they have a live show with a dinosaur, and more! Plus it's a beautiful building with meticulously upkept flowers and plants with a great view of the water. Very kid friendly (or good for adults like me haha). Highly recommend!

Gardens By The Bay,Stephanie W.,25/12/2024,"It's not a proper visit to Singapore if you don't go to gardens by the bay at some point. It's a HUGE expanse of greenery so you can walk a long time and see a lot! I love the super trees, and the indoor botanical garden was my favorite - it's a nice break from the heat too, because it's always so humid in Singapore... but inside the Flower Dome, it's actually air conditioned and not hot like a greenhouse. The flowers are just stunning and the whole expanse is very walkable! I really enjoyed the giant indoor waterfall across the way in the Cloud Forest dome as well. Of note - to go into the flower dome, or any of the other ""dome"" experiences, you have to buy separate tickets (or a ticket package). It's kind of expensive, if memory serves it was like $60 USD for two of the 4-5 experiences they had available. Was worth it in my opinion, but doing every experience would be both expensive, and exhausting since the heat/humidity while walking around really saps your energy!

One other note: at the ticket area near the flower dome/Cloud Forest, there's a little cafe with snacks and ice cream. I am a total sucker for floral flavors, so the floral ice creams were right up my alley! I got a double scoop (2 flavors) of ice cream, the orchid vanilla and the cherry blossom. They're sweet and floral - I just love it. Great given the heat too! They do NOT let you sample any of the ice creams though so beware of that.

Overall: gardens by the bay are super cute! Wear comfy walking shoes, or pay for the driven tour cause it's a LOT of walking.

So, if you don't think you'll ever come back to visit Singapore after visiting once, then I would definitely recommend visiting Gardens By The Bay and pay for all the attractions. This can definitely be a full day event if you're up for it. Also a paradise for the garden/plant enthusiasts and horticulturists alike.

However, I felt meh with this garden. It was hot and humid. Everything was a money trap. You have to pay to get on the bridge, pay for flower dome and sky dome and the skyview. We only went on the bridge which turned out to be $14 SGD per person (or was it $24pp?). I can't remember, but maybe the flower dome was $27 SGD per person? Yeah...

I think it could be worth it if I was into plants.

Gardens By The Bay,Helene S.,5/1/2024,"Get transported into the magical world of Gardens by the bay.

Wow!! What an incredible, iconic place to visit in Singapore. We had limited time as our flights were delayed, but we were lucky to arrive at the Golden Hour. So beautiful to walk through the gardens as the sun was setting. 

Floral Fantasy. The Cloud Forest. Supertree Grove. Dragonfly and Kingfisher Lakes. Serene Garden. The Canyon. 

So many stunning gardens. 

Since we had very limited time, we mainly explored the Cloud Forest and the Supertree Grove.       

The Cloud Forest at Gardens by the Bay created an immersive experience inspired by the movie Avatar. So interesting to see the mystical world of Pandora brought to life across the iconic cascading waterfalls, beautiful gardens and elevated walkways in the Cloud Forest.

Separated into five zones, a life-size banshee welcomes visitors to the World of Pandora. Loved the beautiful pathways lit up at night in a splash of colors.

As you explore each zone, there are docents that operate a puppet baby banshee and baby viperwolf as well as other audio and visual representations of the film. Cute to snap a selfie.

Other highlights included the cavern with stalagmites and stalactites, the collection of white Dale Chihuly glass and the Orchid Haven. The ""Cloud Mountain"" itself is amazing. It is covered in orchids, ferns, mosses and bromeliads. I bet without the Avatar Experience, it still would have been amazing.

Afterwards, we headed to the Supertree Grove for the sound and light show. AMAZING!! Loved the free Garden Rhapsody light-and-sound show where the trees ""come alive"" dancing to the music nightly.

It is also so interesting how these artificial trees mimic natural plants. The Supergrove Trees harness solar energy by using photovoltaic cells. They also collect rainwater for use in irrigation and fountain displays 

It was the perfect way to spend the evening after a long day of travel.

Gardens By The Bay,Sara C.,10/4/2024,"The Gardens by the Bay stands at the foot of the gigantic Marina Bay Sands hotel (that looks like a cruise ship on stilts), but the Gardens are just as impressive.

As you walk around the Gardens on the ground, you'll see the recognizable buildings around you, but you'll also be treated across the bay to eye melting views of the Singapore skyline, dominated by the Singapore Flyer ferris wheel (probably the best spot for a photo of it). 

The most iconic feature in the Gardens by the Bay (that you've probably seen in travel shows and snaps) is the Supertree Grove. 

These are 80-150 feet high tree-like lighted structures so they definitely dominate that area of the Gardens. 

You feel so tiny walking under these gorgeous behemoths. They are a sight to behold during daylight hours, but when they're lit up at night, it's a whole different experience.

The other impressive sight (inside and out) is the Flower Dome conservatory. It's an interior greenhouse (the largest greenhouse in the world, btw), in a dome like glass structure. Inside the Flower Dome there are countless plants and flora being protected in the perfectly temperate Mediterranean climate. 

And finally, the other neatest feature is the Cloud Forest. It also is a glass greenhouse that is higher but more narrow than the Flower Dome. It features the Cloud Mountain in the middle, which is made up of flowers, ferns, and other plant life, and has a beautiful waterfall tumbling down its front.

There are so many amazing sights in the Gardens by the Bay, you can definitely spend an entire day here.

Gardens By The Bay,Elaine Y.,15/11/2023,"Wow! How is this attractive attraction free?! It's gorgeous! And the lighting of the super trees after dark is just magical! I originally was in the area in the early afternoon but decided that it would be better to come back in the early evening and boy was I right!

You can enter the garden free of charge but to do the skywalk will cost you SGD 12. Not sure if the observatory also charges (it was down for maintenance) but keep that in mind. I did pay for the skywalk but I timed my entry (15 min limit up top, loosely enforced) for golden hour and was struck with awe at the top! 

The view of the city is striking and you also get a super close view of the canopies from the super trees which is pretty neat! The orange and pink hues from the sunset were just sprinkles on top to be honest! Additionally, the vertical gardens are marvelous! It was super cool seeing flowers bloom so high up! 

Generally I also love that Singapore places so much focus on replanting enough trees and greenery to match what was displaced while building some of their fascinating buildings.

Definitely visit if you can!",5,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2KIez_S3vnCtFAHAlR4nGg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NadCco4SYSv9kp8ejBI0gQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4ZjT_G1UbOm1SsGFOeTOJw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/t0FBNJJ3DFsoAcY-xEytLw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Lcxu6sooh7DaukcRJYq-Bg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6PC4jzX5m-VwgJNJSvGXuA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7c6WqH6mm4nC7hPHNPwcnA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EmuGQYtFK0X9LRfaifU1-A/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jrx6nvey3MtHD4XxsSB9CQ/o.jpg,,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,Anna H.,3/10/2023,"Wish I had checked Yelp prior to going because I had no idea it was a free garden! The website made it seem like you had to pay just to enter. Of course there are areas where you have to pay. 
Came on the day of Mid Autumn Festival and it was packed as they had an event that evening. Evening to night is truly the best time to see the giant trees lit up. Everywhere was scenic, lush, and beautiful-I'm glad I got to visit this iconic place and found that it was not necessary to pay to enter the other spaces as it was already an enjoyable garden park already.",5,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AcXEpQO2CYZLsS0iqY732g/o.jpg,Celebrated Mid Autumn festival with the super trees,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,Steph C.,7/12/2024,"We spent 36 hours in Singapore last month, landing early in the morning after a short red-eye. Tired and unshowered, with hours to go until we could get into our hotel room, we took the subway to Gardens by the Bay. This was the right call, as it turned out: a morning visit when the heat was reasonable, a few hours before the promised afternoon rain. As first-time tourists, we were also happy to check Singapore's number one attraction off our list.

The place was spectacular, a 260-acre park dense with both plant life and architectural splendor. We'd been to the United Arab Emirates the week before and seen the Dubai Miracle Garden, an expression of floral opulence from the people who brought us the Burj Khalifa. Gardens by the Bay had the same over-the-top ethos, but it made the Dubai garden look like a small, charming amusement park.

Tickets were quite expensive, with most of the individual attractions priced a la carte. We bought combo tickets for the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, at $59 (SGD)--about $44 (USD)--apiece. We added the Supertree Observatory and the OCBC Skyway, which each cost another $14 (SGD) per ticket. Resident prices were considerably lower, which makes sense. If I lived in Singapore, my kids would grow up playing in the Gardens.

If you've seen Crazy Rich Asians (or, I don't know, googled Singapore, you've probably come across pictures of Gardens by the Bay and its distinctive Supertrees, striking tree-like structures that serve as vertical gardens teeming with orchids and myriad other plants. We started our visit at the Supertree Observatory in the tallest of the eighteen Supertrees, going up to a rooftop deck with breathtaking views of Singapore. We didn't make it to the Marina Bay Sands on this trip, but we did get some good pictures with it from the Supertree (it is, it must be said, a very cool but very ugly building).

We hit the OCBC Skyway next, getting the outdoor stuff out of the way while it was comparatively cool (sweltering hot by most standards) and not raining. This was an aerial walkway suspended between two Supertrees, with more lovely views.

The giant shell-like glasshouses of the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome form the other salient architectural feature of Gardens by the Bay. We spent most of our visit walking through this conservatory complex, which was genuinely astonishing.

The Cloud Forest offered a multi-story walk in the clouds, with a meticulously controlled tropical mountain climate, achieved with the help of periodic misting that gave it a Jurassic Park vibe (there was a light Jurassic Park--or at least Jurassic--motif running throughout the Gardens). We started at the top and wound down through the varying elevations, passing the giant indoor waterfall several times--apparently the second-tallest indoor waterfall in the world, after the Rain Vortex at the Changi Airport, which we saw the next day. The whole place was ragingly lush, with everything from carnivorous plants to countless varieties of orchids. Tons of stuff for the 'gram, what with the waterfall and the plant walls, plus Chihuly glass and a room full of stalagmites and stalactites.

The Flower Dome is the world's largest glass greenhouse, and it was sumptuous and impressive, with a sunny garden party atmosphere. We're from California and enjoyed the California garden, as well as the other regional gardens on display. I especially liked the many baobabs. The plants were interspersed with animal sculptures that were somehow not that cheesy. There was an Alice in Wonderland display, as well as a prominent Yayoi Kusama sculpture of a girl in colorful polka dots. The Flower Dome also has a space for a rotation of seasonal displays. We were there at the end of the Carnival of Flowers, an Australian carnival-themed floral show featuring kangaroos, a ferris wheel, and a merry-go-round (none real, but nice to look at). The Flower Dome ticket included entry into the Monet experience, which is what it sounds like, one of those pretty but soulless art attractions made for social media.

We browsed the gift shop and picked up a few souvenirs, including a post card and magnets and glow-in-the-dark T-shirts for our kids (surprisingly a much smaller selection of these for children than for adults). I loved the two women who helped us out, the no-nonsense older lady who knew exactly what sizes to get for our boys off the top of her head, and the younger cashier who checked us out with the lithe efficiency of a Vegas dealer.

We spent a good two hours at Gardens by the Bay, moving at a fairly brisk clip. It was a marvelous, one-of-a-kind place, a must-visit for anyone passing through Singapore. I kept thinking about how much my sons would enjoy it, and I hope to take them one day. I want to see their faces when they walk into the Cloud Forest and look up at that waterfall.",5,arts,,,Arts

There are things to do/see around the park. Some require admission fee. Supertree Grove skyway, Flower Dome, Cloud Forest, etc. The Garden Rhapsody light show at night is free.

Gardens By The Bay,Luke T.,4/4/2024,"I've been tardy, and this review is as laggy as a dial up connection.

This attraction is worth it.  Yes, there is a ton of people, and it takes aways from the experience when one is visiting a garden.  Then again, if you've been to Singapore.... it is crowded everywhere.  If I was a mosquito, i would wanna be in Singapore, cos there is no shortage of food.

We visited during Chinese New Year, and they had a special exhibit going on, and a nite event, and it was ... crowded.  Getting in was not an issue, the lines were fast, and again like everything else in Singapore.. it was efficient.  The line was approx 2000km long, but it was moving at light speed, so that's good. Once inside, it was smaller than expected.  The plants were healthy, the paths were wide, you can go at your own pace.  Do take your time, they;ve gathered a formidable collection of plants from all over the world.  Like all 4 corners of the world, all staged for  your enjoyment, so you better line it.. hmmph.

The blooms that was in season were the spring season , Chinese New Year theme when I visited.  Stunning, color, variation, and all super healthy. 

If you are on the fence.. don;t be.  Bring everyone.  I mean.. its worth a visit.  They had peonies when it was off season.  An amazing feat actually.",5,arts,,,Arts

Gardens By The Bay,Laura S.,27/4/2023,"This was a highlight of our short trip to Singapore.  I'm not sure where to begin as the complex is so massive. We started at the Flower Dome (fee area), where we literally spent hours. There were two levels of themed indoor gardens to explore and to take photos. We explored slowly, both to enjoy the exhibits but also to explore the oppressive Singapore heat and humidity!   We then went outside to explore some of the FREE outdoor areas -- which included a walk through the Kingfisher Wetlands, and photos bear the floral clock. 

Later, we enjoyed the FREE light and music show at the Supertree Grove. Tip: get there early for good seats. (Most people sit on the edges of the giant flower planters).

By then, I was tired but we had already purchased tickets to the Supertree observatory. You go up an elevator to an open upper area with magnificent views of the Singapore skyline, Ferris wheel, and other attractions. The evening lights were magical. I took a ton of somewhat obstructed photos before realizing that there is another level that you could take stairs up to with unobstructed views.

I was in Singapore a few months ago but it just seemed like yesterday. We got tickets through viator which is a third party but it includes the full tour of the gardens. Flower dome is a beautiful walk through where you can see all the flowers from different countries even different theme arrangements. Luckily we went near Christmas and New Years so they had the cutest elf spring theme and reindeer sleigh theme. It was so huge you literally can get lost. From desert flowers to holland tulips and Italian greenery. They have so much things you can learn.

Cloud forest- The other part of the tour was like walking into the avatar movie. the waterfalls and sounds were so amazing. You can literally walk up to the 6th floor and reach the very top of the Forest dome. There are also elevators to make it easier for those tho can not walk too much or those with strollers. Each floor had something so cool to see. you can literally touch the leaf pad and it takes your hand warmth to generate light all throughout the forest. Also there is a floor where you can see an actual avatar flying dino with its eggs. A simulator where you can turn into an avatar and just so much to mention.

Gardens By The Bay,Daniel C.,12/9/2023,"When you think of Singapore, shopping and eating come immediately to mind.  The food culture is simply overwhelming here with restaurants everywhere: hotels, hawker centers, malls, MRT stations, and yes standalone restaurants.  Some big food courts even have smaller food courts inside.  Don't get me started on the malls either - imagine the Las Vegas strip with casinos replaced by malls. That's like Orchard Road.

To take a break from all this and get back to nature, I highly recommend Gardens By the Bay.  They have multiple ticket options and you can easily spend 1 hour to an entire day here.  The Gardens, and the neighboring Marina Bay Sands lights up at night.

Highlights of my visit:
* The lowest price ticket is Floral Fantasy.  You get entrance through an indoor conservatory with some very artistic floral arrangements, complete with waterfalls, statues, and sounds.  Lots of places for selfies and Instagram-worthy pictures.  At the end, there's a cool 4D virtual ride which provides a nice overview of the other exhibits.
* The Poison Dart Frog exhibit was cool, showing multiple species of this tiny, but dangerous animal. The Gold one secretes enough poison to kill 10 people or 20,000 mice.
* After that, its free to walk around the massive gardens yourself to check out those SuperTrees and some truly amazing outdoor art sculptures.
* For food and drinks, try the Jurassic Food Court serving up 1-Michelin dishes like ramen, soya chicken, etc. at the various food stands.  
* You can get some nice shots of the Bay, Marina Bay Sands, and Singapore Flyer too.
* Signage is good so you won't get lost wandering.

Gardens By The Bay,Christie S.,22/12/2022,"This was probably the coolest botanical garden I have ever been to! I believe the most popular attractions are the flower dome and cloud forest. Since we had a lot of time in Singapore, we also got tickets for floral fantasy and the OCBC skyway. Singapore is very hot and humid and I was a little worried since I thought all the plants would be in a warm greenhouse and it turned out I was completely wrong! I'm not sure how it was possible but there was ac inside flower dome, cloud forest, and floral fantasy! They were having an avatar exhibit in the cloud forest when I visited and it was very cool! If you would like to take some pictures for your instagram, highly recommend the floral fantasy! They had a lot of setups there that would make the perfect instagram photos! 

If you're debating between going to the OCBC skyway or the supertree grove, I would recommend the OCBC skyway! I think that's the best way to take pictures with the supertree!

Gardens By The Bay,Osula L.,7/12/2022,"If you come to Singapore, you have to check this place out. If you don't have time, I'd just check out the Cloud Forest and the OCBC Skyway. If you can, come in the evening for the Supertree light show at 7:45 PM. 

I came here, via MRT, on a late Monday afternoon in early December 2022. Apparently if it rains, you will not be granted access to the OCBC Skyway. At the time I went, there was a Christmas thing going on so there was no reentry after leaving the Supertree Grove area, which something I did not know about. They made me pay another $12 on top of everything else to get back into the Supertree area for the 7:45 PM light show. 

This place is huge. Give yourself plenty of time and where good walking shoes. I didn't get to see the Floral Fantasy but if I ever go back to Singapore I'd probably try that one.

Gardens By The Bay,Neelu Y.,10/5/2024,"Gardens by the Bay is a must visit for me every time I'm in Singapore. It's free to explore most of the grounds, and they're absolutely stunning. I love coming in the evening to attend the light show in Supertree Grove. It's free to watch and makes for such a fun activity. The Cloud Forest Dome and Flower Dome are both beautiful and worth the visit. It's around $34/person for entry to both domes. Currently they have an exhibition in the Flower Dome called Tulipmania until May 26. It's gorgeous and transports you to the Netherlands. I definitely recommend making a visit if you can while they still have Tulipmania! Regardless, it's a wonderful place to visit year round.",5,arts,,,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,Katey G.,1/7/2022,"Gardens by the Bay is a must visit in Singapore!

It's super centrally located and easy to get to. Even if you don't pay to visit the inside, they have the gorgeous light up trees which are best seen at night.

For you Americans... they have a Starbucks and McDonalds (with very fun McFlurry flavors like MANGO!).

PS there is air conditioning inside!",5,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/grNRVWKRFxz8_KIPOL-kAw/o.jpg,,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,Garett S.,9/9/2022,"Easily one of the best gardens you will ever see (probably the best ever) You can visit the gardens for free with exception of the cloud forest, flower garden & super trees.

First visit to the Gardens by the bay could easily be a while or at least half day experience.  I only went for 2-3 hours and that wasn't enough.  Next time I visit I look to stay longer.  The gardens are huge with many different types of gardens and tons of food options.  For food I just opted for shake shack, but they have a food court, hawker center and other popular dinning options on the site.  

If you could only do one ticketed event I would have to say it would need to be the cloud forest.  A rain forest dome with a mountain you can scale on the center with a multi story water fall.  We probably spent most of our time here and it speaks to just how grand things are in Singapore.  I did see the flower dome which was really good, but not as impressive as the cloud forest.  Back in the States we have the Bellagio gardens in Vegas which is what this reminded me of.  

One word of advice is the gardens grounds are huge  and it can be easy to get lost especially at night which happened to me.  The night time show with the super trees is nice, but not necessarily a must. 

During my time I've seen a lot of beautiful gardens but nothing like this.  This is the one major attraction in Singapore that if you could only visit one you must see!",5,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/C8H32nxif_buaQmZRkIvHA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3TUtAbimWWJMhHSCDX8vMA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ExCHFb1iIPqFvSmNlI7exA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Zyx79kQ-kNrhLiddWTIjqg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4Eq6Fuy7DFDaxDMqLNvIYA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qNPtT2Z2MN8bF142jXNCGg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bDBTUQQnTKdbKxoy6RtXCg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YdXJqHdi1TH-OxPkBuTRZA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tlmtnsDyyRCzmTTqdo2vJQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cxmCV2UsKtd_C3LgaY8AOA/o.jpg,Super Tree light show; Flower Dome; Flower Dome,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,Maggie D.,21/6/2023,"This is the most iconic spot in Singapore, in my opinion. As in, if you only have a short amount of time and can only make it to ONE place, this would be it. The main attractions are the very famous super grove trees, cloud forest, flower dome, floral fantasy, and OCBC skyway (walkway).  Aside from this there are also many smaller attractions like garden areas, pathways, and more.  

You could easily spend a whole day here if you really wanted to explore.  You could also do it in a couple hours too. I'd personally recommend about 3 hours to hit the main parts.

Admission to the park itself is free, however you will have to buy tickets for the bigger attractions like some of the ones mentioned above. The super trees are free though! I think that's pretty cool since they are probably the most well-known image you'd think of. You can buy these other tickets ahead online, and that's very convenient. They have several options depending on what all you want to do. I'd say my favorite ticket item was the cloud forest (which is typically sold in combination with the flower dome) and the OCBC skyway.  I just loved being among those super trees I had seen in photos so many times.

I almost forgot! They also have a light show at the trees 2x every night. Again since the super tree area is free, the show is too! It was really cool. When I was there, the show was about featuring different Asian countries. It felt very fitting since I was hopping around to some of these countries at the time :)",5,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oWIaKXZFBNzf-Ac9fqBCMw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SXufNqdZa2fezOcGkr540A/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HN3nXA1exB_WVoEYYPIrpg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qY_D2-Riaxc6mqE2Ogj9eA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MuDF2cq9oh5NWt-4pgBHgA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/s64GxQUt_ngkoWPlNqGYoQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nfRjdIixiEybS4ncvYfcLA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8kfs2cgqlX2y0pUNNyhXqA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/c3FJDnmsi7SN7MLjgbFDlQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UsMH1j4lyuuseBO6CFfMVw/o.jpg,Fun free in the flower dome; Walkway; From under the super trees!; Flower dome; Skyway; Cloud forest waterfall.

Gardens By The Bay,Vinkin Ken T.,16/2/2023,"This is a review of the light show of the Super Trees. Light show is daily. Times are 7:45pm and 8:45pm. During the winter holidays they had added a later time. The show only lasts 10 minutes. I believe each night the display is different. This was my first visit but came with a local who told me it was different than he remembered. There is also music with the lights and during Christmas, holiday music was played. We arrived at 8:30pm on Sunday night and there were a lot of people there. Some people have claimed seats but the show is best seen standing, though you may strain your neck a bit by looking up. Some people had hogged spaces by laying down so they can look up. Even at night, we were sweaty. It can get so humid here.",5,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uubYeC7eCx7gs3VBjp66jg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/N-0z9_Ahx9e2jVgpEBlTww/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZZ7gCone6oGLiflCWcnM3g/o.jpg,,Arts

Gardens By The Bay,Vivian C.,8/1/2024,"Gardens By The Bay is one of the spots you must stop at while visiting Singapore!

It is a mix of botanical gardens and Avatar-inspired trees that light up the night every night. I was lucky to go during the holidays so they had large holiday decorations, lights, and live music. There are different tunnels to go through that also light up as well.

There is an additional cost to go on the sky deck which is the upper part of the Avatar ""trees"" where you can cross bridges. It might not be for the faint of heart for those who don't like heights but I am sure the water and city view is breathtaking. 

You can easily spend an evening here and grab some great photo and video ops. The entrance is fairly close to Marina Bay Sands so you can couple up the excursion together if you decide to do both (or are staying at Marina Bay Sands).",5,arts,,,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,Stephanie Y.,6/4/2023,"Gardens by the Bay is a must-see when in Singapore! Located behind the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, the area is a short walk from the hotel. You can easily spend half a day or more visiting all the attractions, and my husband and I ended up splitting our visit into two days. One evening to see the Supertrees, walk the OCBC Skyway, and watch the light show, and a second day to visit the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. I used Klook to buy tickets to the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest and saved a decent amount off the door price. 

I think the best time to visit the Supertrees and walk the OCBC Skyway is sunset. You'll get those serene pictures of the trees lit up at night (they don't have the same effect during the day) and can catch the nightly 15 minute light show at either 7:45 or 8:45 pm. We did have to buy a separate ticket to go up to the OCBC Skyway and were limited to 15 minutes at the top to keep traffic flowing. The line however, moved pretty fast, and the walkway gave great views of the MBS Hotel and the bay and an aerial view of the trees. The Supertrees are mesmerizing when all lit up, and watching the free Garden Rhapsody light show with my husband was a nice and romantic way to start off our honeymoon. 

It is cherry blossom season in the Flower Dome, and there were a lot of flowers in bloom during my recent visit. The dome features plants and trees from around the world. It took us about 45 minutes to get through the exhibit, and we really liked seeing the Baobab trees and the dragon statue on display. 

The Avitar Experience at the Cloud Forest was a lot of fun. When we first walked in, we saw this massive indoor waterfall and felt like we had been transported to Pandora. Various Avitar characters are scattered throughout the exhibit, and there were opportunities to turn ourselves into an Avitar character and to fly a Banshee! We went up to the top of the waterfall and took the various pathways down. It was great to feel what it's like to be in the cloud forest and to see more great views of the bay. My husband and I spent slightly more than 1 hour in the cloud forest, but the experience could have taken much longer on a busy day. Both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest exit into a gift shop, and I bought myself a set of Supertree stickers to remember the visit. 

There are plenty of food options on-site. We ate at the Jurassic Nest Hall, which allowed us to try several of Singapore's Michelin-rated places, including Hawker Chan's famous Soya Sauce Chicken and Tsuta's Soba Ramen. I was a little disappointed in the Soya Sauce Chicken, but my bowl of Tsuta Ramen was delicious! I ordered the original Truffle Shoyu Soba, and my husband had the crab soba. The soup base was rich in flavor, and the soba noodles were filling but not heavy like traditional ramen noodles. We also tried Took Lae Dee. I highly recommend their Pad See Ew as it was better than any Pad See Ew I've ever had in California. 

Gardens By the Bay was definitely one of the highlights of my trip, and by going on a weekday, we avoided the crowds!",5,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/T9TvFruBOJqDMcff1Ceqhg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DbMnPcdKyxt1ktZss18eGA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4RYwQ_YPORNjKvQVTlOumg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/P7gafgF8joOIz16CslLizA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/745ayitfhZMgzJcXP_uYyw/o.jpg,Supertrees at night; Part of the Avitar Experience; Inside the Flower Dome; During the Garden Rhapsody Light Show,Arts

Gardens By The Bay,Blanche M.,29/11/2022,"This place is beautiful! You can buy your tickets online, which might be quicker. We wanted to ask if we could go see every exhibit, and if there was a combo rate. To save you the trouble, there isn't lol. There is probably 4 exhibits you can combine to get a better rate, but other than that you will have to buy the rest separately. 
The exhibits are all walking distance from one another, but you can buy the shuttle service if you have trouble or get tired from walking. They do recommend doing the walkway and the observation deck first due to the unpredictable weather in Singapore. The walkway was pretty scary, but surprisingly the observation deck wasn't. I would recommend doing the deck more than the walkway. 
Other than those two exhibits, everything else was indoors. While we were there, they had an aviator exhibit which we thought was really really cool. They have VR machines that turn you into an avatar. 
This place can get busy, and tickets can sell out. 
With your ticket, you can enter any time of day. Although I'm not too sure of in and out privileges.

The park itself is free and you can walk around an enjoy quite a bit here without purchasing any ticket. However, I would recommend doing a couple of attractions like Cloud forest, Flower dome or the skywalk. You'll need to purchase tickets for each of those. 

You get a beautiful view of the whole city and the various attractions like Marina Bay Sands, Singapore Flyer and Merlion from various parts of the park and do stay for the light show in the evening.

You'll be dead tired at the end of the day but it's well worth the time spent here.",5,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/m7aBaAuYPwuz1wzBjx-g3A/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IH-d5vQZtUZPshuZ7xsayg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VwNq8t2GFbYVRj8n3HS5Rw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lNQf2tV4taNlipJwy3R9zA/o.jpg,,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,Mel T.,8/12/2022,"An obvious tourist attraction you should check out when visiting Singapore. Yes, it can get crowded but it's definitely worth checking out the Supertree Grove (this is free but if you want to do the sky walk, you need to buy tickets). It's more crowded at night since most people want to see the trees lit up at night - especially for the Garden Rhapsody show, which is every night at 7:45 and 8:45. The show lasts for about 15 minutes. If you're coming from the Shoppes at Marina Bay, there's a way to cut through the mall, instead of walking all the way outside and around to the Grove. The day time is much less crowded. It's still pretty in the day time so I would recommend checking it out both times if you can. During the day, there are some hawker stalls set up by the Supertrees. Also in the same vicinity is the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome (tickets required for each). You would need a whole day just to explore the area, especially if you want to lump in Marina Bay as well. We ended up trekking to the area on two separate days from Chinatown (where we were staying) and it was totally worth the trip.",5,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/24jw39NK1HZ4BRi60KkrYA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XVgKkLowQgn-BK1RA3Ab6A/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/R66Sn2lHHEY5036-plt-Wg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4KPUAhqo79PDotBHF4BuGw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WD8rzfg44gr9UzywKG88cQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/K1YiwQr6Zj-_dvFn_AFGpA/o.jpg,Mid autumn festival display,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,Edna G.,10/2/2020,"Unfortunately, we didn't get to see the supertrees skyway due to the rain the last two days we went here. They closed the OCBC skyway observatory deck due to safety reasons. I mean that's good but bad timing for us. Our ticket lasts 5 months so we'll see if we come back or give it away. There are no refund if we miss the opportunity to go. It's unfortunate. :-(

The trees were beautiful decorated with plants and flowers especially during their light show at 8pm. You have to stay close by the area to reserve a seat to see this an hour before the light show. We saw this afar and it was beautiful none the less. 

Hopefully, you don't come here during the rainy season and miss this like us. It would be well worth the advance purchase. At least, we got to see the Cloud and Flower domes since it's covered.

There are hours worth of walking trails not to mention the flower garden and cloud forest which are unique in their own ways and loads of family friendly activities. 

This place suits anyone regardless of how much time you have and money you want to spend. If you want to go all out and spend a whole day there's enough stuff to do that but if you don't want to spend money and only have an hour a stroll around the super tree grove is more than worth it.

Gardens By The Bay,Gustavo M.,20/5/2023,"If you have never been to the Amazon Spheres, it's worth a visit. If you've never been to the Gardens by the Bay, it's worth a visit. If you're showing a friend around, it's worth the visit. Other than that, to be quite honest, it's not really a thing you'd want to visit over and over. 
Even the Avatar exhibit was kinda let down: seemed like the picture booth, aka ""avatarize yourself"" was kinda lame, sorry to say. A few of the things promised, like the ""fly a banshee"" were closed, and some of the other gimmicks were not only, well, gimmicky, but also out of order.
Anyway,  the fact that the gardens are enclosed in air conditioned environment that gives your group a break from the often oppressive heat and humidity of Singapore, makes the price of admission worth Every. Single. 
Singapore. Dollar!!!
Pro tip: make sure you get bottled water before heading to the gardens because the hot, uncovered path can be a killer.

Gardens By The Bay,Ashley C.,29/2/2020,"We came to check out Gardens by the Bay on a Wednesday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all! I don't know if the coronavirus was to blame, or maybe because it was a weekday, but it made it nice and easy for us to go through the exhibits! We walked through the Supertree Grove first, to get to the Skyway. It was a great view of the city but probably not recommended for those scared of heights! It was a windy day also, so it was a little bit scary for me on the narrower sides of the skyway. I've seen photos of the Supertree Grove at night and I think that would be a diffferent experience, but equally as magnificent as in the daytime. It's a pretty short bridge but I think it's fairly priced at $8 SGD per person, because of the amazing views. 

We went through the Cloud Forest after, to get out of the warm sun. It had such beautiful architecture and vegetation inside. It seems small at first but there are so many different levels and areas to walk through. There were several other attractions here but those were the only two we had time to visit. If you can carve out a full morning or afternoon, I would definitely recommend it. They have package deals for tickets so you can visit multiple attractions with a discounted rate as well.",5,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AIhQxqOY3O53fgmFa1ZeoQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tAZJRY0hDbkYfT05P6JVKQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2uWxMT2mItdJCErvcJfJpw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jQLbDVg-wPojAO2hzy7Twg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zqB1vVqV6OI7Nm4ybG-C5g/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Y9BGsDM99qWr0rrw9DjHYA/o.jpg,View from the Skyway,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,Max S.,27/9/2019,"If you visit Singapore, I highly recommend coming here. Daytime, to walk the huge garden. Night time, to see the beautiful lights. 

They also have attractions. I chose to purchase the attraction bundle, which included:  ""Floral Fantasy,"" ""Flower Dome,"" ""Cloud Forest,"" and shuttle service to the last two. The shuttle service is worth it, especially after having walked the grounds of the entire garden in the 90 degree plus weather, and enduring the high humidity. The attractions are indoors in wonderfully temperature controlled, man made environments.  There's a short little 4D film at the end of Floral Fantasy. It's all beautiful for those of us who like to view different flora and fauna all in one place.  It's fun for the entire family.  

Each attraction exits you right into a great gift shop. There is also a couple cafes located on the premises. The one located right inside the Flower Dome looked like fun; too bad I had just eaten.

Gardens By The Bay,Scott S.,2/10/2019,"The first thing to know about Gardens By The Bay is that it is one massive tourist attraction. It has highly constructed facilities that you can pay to go into, plus it has large gardens, ponds, and even a few aquariums around the property that are offered free of charge.

For many, they find this location a great place to spend time with the family. It is also a good place to get in a little exercise and walk and/or run around. 

Personally, for those of us who know what this area of Singapore used to be like... Meaning, those of us who are a little bit older, we may remember what this area was, once upon a time. For me, that was a much more ascetically pleasing period of time. This is not to say that Gardens By The Bay is not a great place but I am just saying that it lacks any true Singaporean culture. 

So, go here if you want to interact with a lot of tourists and see some marginally interesting tourist attractions. But, if you want to see what Singapore is truly all about, you may have to go to other locations.",3,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gBfdh2-N5SGGMYPSIxWvFA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SxewcBKlVlP2h9klAcYegA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ka9S2HPkrlxQmWYhcNhvsw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kkZIf9v4L9j0r4rYpGaH1g/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bL_dD_I83vmQCrxfiglyyA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GlIcgAQYQVXCPzGLVWAgHg/o.jpg,,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,Amanda S.,10/6/2020,"How anyone could walk out of this magnificent creation and not be amazed is beyond me. It's absolutely incredible. You get to explore three astounding waterfront gardens with plant species from 5 different continents over 250 acres. There are plants so rare you have to travel to specific parts of third world countries if you ever want to catch a glimpse - unless you're here. 

You can see the ginormous conservatories from MBS and the freeway. If you didn't know you'd think they were large offices or rather unique apartments because Singapore is all about unique. The real gem of it all are the Bay South Gardens, comprised of two conservatories: the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. 

The Flower Dome was absolutely amazing, beautiful and striking in every way. The colors of the rainbow splash throughout the entire dome. It's almost overwhelming how many plants are being grown here. I believe there are 8 different gardens featured here, my personal favorite being the Succulents. The Cloud Forest was just as impressive. The ginormous Cloud Mountains stands at 138 feet, and it's just spectacular to admire. You have to take a picture by the waterfall to complete the experience, and walk to the top of the mountain! 
Lastly I thoroughly enjoyed walking through the Supergrove trees, especially at night. 

The entire park is an absolute gem. I truly believe this is one of the most beautiful, if not the most, creations by man. The design, the work, the brain behind the concept is an intricate example of visions of grandeur accomplished. It is a must visit for tourists in Singapore!!!",5,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Jw0p0p4oU5pmBCl64rP8-g/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MTqX0VzIXLyHLUHGdKHg4Q/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iihlpsRxIoYj0ktM5HtOzw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SqrtIVz7qpyyIq4M2tSdEg/o.jpg,,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,Dean N.,6/10/2019,"I remember I was scrolling through a friends' feed and there was a picture of him posed in front of the Gardens By the Bay in the background.  I was fascinated by the trees behind him in that picture which made me research more of Singapore.  Thus, I thank my friend for planting the seed to visit Singapore 1.5 years ago.  Thanks Jose.

In my opinion, The Gardens By the Bay is synonymous to Singapore.  As the same can be said about with the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.  They just go hand and hand together.   Like dark chocolate dusted with sea salt. Together. 

The Gardens By the Bay is a large park which is free to enter.  There is no admission to walk around the park.  I saw a lot of locals jogging around the park at night.  I can't imagine doing that during the day.  That said, the attractions which include the two domes (the Cloud Forrest and Flower dome) and OCBC Skyway are paid admission fees.   I encourage you to pay to see all three.  I only had the opportunity to see the two domes and missed the chance to go to the skyway.  But, I was very particular as too when I wanted to go on the skyway since the paid admission is for only one usage.  The domes on the other hand, allow you to get a re-entry stamp when you exit which is valid for the entire day.

Both the Cloud Forrest and the Flower dome have their charm.  Head to the Flower Dome if you want to immerse yourself in a bouquet of flowers from all over the world.   If you want to feel as if you are in a different planet, go to the Cloud Forrest.  The Cloud Forrest also boasts having one of the largest indoor waterfalls.  It is a spectacular sight to witness with your own eyes.  Explore both domes and learn about sustainability which is prevalent in the structure and urban planning of this beautify country.

I would encourage you to see the park both during the day and at night as the park truly gives off a different energy during both times.   In the evening, there is a light show with the skytreees in the skytree grove that is mesmerizing.   

Note - I would plan accordingly if you do go to the Gardens at night.  Last admission time for the OCBC Skyway is 8pm. Also note that if there is a sign stating that there will be street food, it is concession type food.",5,arts,,,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,Tyler D.,29/12/2023,"On the 28th of December, 2023, my wife and I went to purchase tickets on your website for the super tree grove + flower dome (or what're the tf it is called - btw this was the dumbest attraction I've ever been too). I was confused because I thought it would have been the two main attractions in one package, super tree grove + cloud forest. Little did I know after the purchase, that the tickets were for super tree grove observatory and flower dome (the dumb one still don't know what it's officially called). I then went on to purchase the cloud forest ticket, which was only available in a package with the flower forest (the dumb flower one) and not available as a single purchase. I called +65 6420 6848 multiple times. The automated message prompted me ""to speak to the service representative 1"" after pressing ""1"" I was relayed to the same repeat message to press ""1"". This process occurred about 5 times in a row. The final time, the automated message said ""you have not selected a choice or pressed a button, please call back at another time"" and hung up. 
There I was stuck with two flower dome tickets. When I got to the gardens at the bay I reluctantly walked through the flower attraction bs. Dumbest thing ever but I paid for it, reluctantly, twice. Went onto the cloud forest, meh. Then came the super tree grove. During that day it started raining, so we waited until the rain halted. Then we were told that to get into the super tree grove we would ""need to purchase another ""Christmas event special ticket"". I was flabbergasted, as to why the website wouldn't just sell the Christmas event ticket with the super tree ticket. Then I stood in line to purchase the ""Christmas event ticket"" so that I could honor my super tree grove ticket. After waiting ten minutes in line I got to the front  to purchase this ""Christmas event ticket"" the ticket counter workers told me ""the super tree grove has been suspended due to inclement weather and we do not recommend purchasing Christmas event tickets"". I asked ""so will I be refunded for my original ticket super tree grove ticket?"" The worker said ""to email: feedback@gardensbythebay.com.sg and request for a refund due to inclement weather"". I left the line when it just stopped raining. I went back through the line to the ticket counter and the workers said the same thing ""that it was suspended until further notice and that they don't recommend purchasing tickets"". I said ""alright how or when will you know if it will open?"" The workers said ""oh when they give us a call"". I said ""how will I know if it is open?"" And they gave me a . So I decided to take a walk around the lake where those animal sculptures. Unbeknownst, I fell upon the entrance to the Christmas event. I noticed out of the corner of my eye that workers were letting customers walk inside scanning what looked like CHRISTMAS EVENT TICKETS. I showed  the person at the front my super tree observatory ticket and asked if I could get in and he said ""you need to purchase the Christmas special ticket"". I told him that the ticket counter said that "" the super tree was suspended because of the rain"". He mentioned that it was ""not closed and I could purchase the Christmas event online"" and gave me the QR code for the website. I then went to the website and purchased two Christmas entry tickets for $18. Hooray we finally succeeded, right?  We can finally watch that show at 7:45pm from the observatory. We decided to go to check in at the bottom of the super tree observatory. I was excited to watch the show on that walkway when all of a sudden, the workers at the super tree at the bottom said that ""the walkway is a separate ticket and that you have to exit the Christmas tree area to access it"". I said ""OK BRO IM SO CONFUSED RIGHT NOW I didn't see anything about two separate tickets for the super tree grove"" I then said ""ok whatever"" and decided to enter the observatory anyway because ""we thought"" it would still be cool. Went to the top of the observatory to watch the show. Little did we know that we would be on the top of the lights so WE COULDN'T EVEN SEE THE LIGHT SHOW ON THE TREES because the observatory is above the lights. Absolute waste of time. I decided to look on the website  to see where the ""walkway"" tickets were located. It was of course not on the main page but a ""see all"" tab listed it as an OBCB Walkway (or something like that) it did not mention that it was apart of the super tree grove whatsoever.

Gardens By The Bay,Ai Vy N.,28/2/2019,"A must visit place in Singapore!!!!

With about 10 hours layover in Singapore, we decided to leave the airport and made Gardens by the Bay our very first stop. Don't waste your time and try to save a little bit of money by taking the train. Download ""Grab"" app, it's the equivalent of Uber here in Singapore. From the airport to the garden, it was around $15 for us, and only took about 20mins, train would be over an hour.

It is free admission to Gardens by the Bay. However, the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest, which located inside Gardens by the Bay (hence, the plural in ""Gardens""), do require admission fees. I highly recommend checking out those 2 as well, especially if it's your first time in Singapore. They're well worth it.

There are bicycles for rent (requires an app) if you want to bike around the park, or just venture on foot. We saw plenty of runners and bikers around the perimeter of the Garden since it was still early in the morning (before 10am)

If you've watched ""Crazy Rich Asians"" movie, the last scene where the wedding happened was here at Gardens by the Bay. And it's free! You can also pay to go up to those huge Supertree Groves, which connected by a view deck. 

We spent a good 3-4 hours here (with more than half of those in the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest) and still didn't get the chance to see everything. Definitely a place that we'd love to come back to, especially at night when the Supertree Grove is lit up!!!",5,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UAHv-xb4Oh6A9iXp-2pbJA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pCCaKv_wVGyCxeT2ZCirRA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SqfVBAUWVk8zmLrdEwViAA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OyKEKq5ktRp19cLUhNJOfw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zQg_w_b4Nmk9YvoDQxp67A/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zE3_RV7CpklWcf55mrPPrg/o.jpg,"Where they have the wedding in ""Crazy Rich Asians""; Interesting sculpture; Wood sculpture; We didn't see any otters while we were there tho :(; Beautiful view of Marina Bay",Arts

You get to enjoy all this at the comfort of cool temperature and humidity.

Must visit this place to get the info how trees/plants are helping us to live in this world. Gardens by the bay Singapore is one of the most famous place in the world. it's amazing, you will feel something different which is directly connected with mother nature. I love this place and specially the show they put up every evening around 7:45pm. Strongly recommend buying a ticket to get up to the super trees sky deck during the show and watch them up close.

Everything is  so well maintained. Walking by the road along the river you can come to marina bay mall, where is nice artificial reservoir outside with water lilies. You can also see the Singapore Eye on the other side. The art and creativity was fantastic.

Gardens By The Bay,Hoa L.,6/2/2019,"Expect to spend at the very least half a day at this site. Really, to get enough hours you should schedule a full day. This place is extremely unique, with a blend of modern technology and style with traditional botanical elements. 

The Flower Dome is full of flowers from all over the world while the Cloud Dome *SPOILER* literally has a waterfall coming from the top of a mountain full of vegetation and a winding path. *END* Both domes have indoor cooling (and humidity) to match the needs of the plants. They also had themes inside the Flower Dome when I visited since it was nearing Christmas.

After these two domes, you can choose to walk around the gardens and especially to the Super Trees. These structures are full of plants inside and light up in the evening. For a fee, you can also walk on the paths between the trees in the tree canopy. From here, you can get beautiful views of the Marina Sands Bay hotel also.

You can book tickets online, or wait in line to purchase entrance tickets. There wasn't a long wait, but it could get long as there's only a handful of ticket windows.

Gardens By The Bay,Keith A.,15/8/2019,"Free...Free. Others areas you pay but mostly Free.

The only thing I didn't like is you can't walk there from the flyer (big spinning wheel) which has a lot of food options. This place however has fast food only, quick snacks which is why you should come here after the wheel so you can eat up.

The big trees are massive and beautiful from every angle . Just sit there with ice cream and enjoy it at night. You can walk above them but that cost a ticket and time in line. Singapore isn't as hot as other places in Asia, so it's comfortable to walk around in.

National Gallery Singapore,Michael C.,4/4/2018,"So I will start off by stating that I'm not a big museum guy but the museum really blew me away. I arrived with a donor of the museum who gave me an expectantly unique tour. He took me there to see the famous Chinese ink brush artists as well as a few contemporary Chinese painters. I was blown away with the level of skill required to complete some of the work. I also got to see other Asian artists from the Philippines and Indonesia which is something I don't get to see at home or even in Europe. It was a rare opportunity for me to see artists from other regions who were making beautiful work for centuries unbeknownst to me. 
They also have these cool sky bridges that connect one side of the museum to the other that make for excellent photo ops. There is a roof top bar with a nice view of the skyline as well. This was a good stop and a really cool experience.

National Gallery Singapore,David S.,17/7/2018,"This was a rather pleasant discovery. For a while I had thought that the only art gallery in Singapore was this one near Bras Barash MTR station, and all that one seemed to do was have modern art exhibitions. Well, this is the place to visit if you are looking for a more traditional experience. Okay, it does have a modern art section, but that is generally expected. The gallery itself is quite large, and when we paid it a visit it was free entry, which was a bonus. There were also a number of galleries, including two which contained temporary exhibitions (one of then being works from the d'Orsay). They also offer audio guides, which once again I should not since not every gallery of museum (at least in Australia) offer them.",5,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MoTBC-N7vAksZKFTIHc_gw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pJDEshQCnN-V3y1cBjfn7g/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wbWaZq_zo1YzIF7pLrKjCg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5gD-QiXLu1Fo1xIWF2BFWQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hV2TceQhaITwVkMZ4XX3-Q/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rspLeUr-GIoC5ghR3Akvkg/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gEr5KWxjmhmyXtvE08HH_A/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yNR9v25f3CeqrbMJSP2fGA/o.jpg,,Arts
National Gallery Singapore,Mindy H.,28/8/2017,"Awesome timing!  I was able to view the YAYOI KUSAMA: Life is the Heart of a Rainbow exhibit that is currently on display at the National Gallery until Sun, 3 Sep 2017. We booked our tickets online in advance to avoid lines.  We went late on a weekday and felt like we had the place to ourselves.  The exhibit is breath taking, and a must see.  It's rare to view genius art of this caliber from someone who is still alive!  It is unlike any other exhibit I have seen.  It is definitely an experience.  She literally takes you into the piece of art itself.  I felt like I was Alice in Wonderland and had jumped into a hole into another dimension.  

The National Gallery itself is housed in two national monuments: former Supreme Court and City Hall. The building goes back to 1929, and if the walls could speak they could tell the story of Singapore's colonial times too independence. If you love history, it's worth a visit just to witness the historic architectural beauty of this site. 

General admission is 20 SGD, to visit the Yayoi Kusama exhibit is 25 SGD, and an all access pass is 30 SGD. 

Be sure to check out the rooftop garden while you are here.  There is also a great cocktail bar on the roof with a phenomenal view, and restaurant in the museum serving up some tasty food in a beautiful setting.",5,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ybsUbDEKQCMxGg7lqwJSvQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IxDVFCQ_fpUqEhBo1Xs0gQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6Czlh3N0sL4bvXx1_hjzYw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gC_eUC9hjLBacqUqfWz-hQ/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mczD3vWHI3U0adwdYexMDw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/e5qUyMPVt3a8Adfi4UGPEA/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/B0dyfCeD2mtOd_pHyNT_ig/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DGaHHMQLfVQ1Arc10r-_pw/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/igB-StjmfqV7Lkfs8Dbkew/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/b1WPeATgVlTxielkCx4zdg/o.jpg,,Arts
National Gallery Singapore,Linda L.,5/4/2017,"If you love art. This is the place to be. 

Upon arriving.. since my friend is a local. They had some sort of promotion going on for locals who had a particular bank card. If you have that bank card.. you and a friend get free passes to the museum plus free passes to the upgraded editions of the museum. To be honest I'm not sure if it was one or two friends free but the guy at the ticketing counter gave the three of us three free passes to go into the museum. (Originally he gave her her free pass. And me a free pass. But my husband was missing one pass. I think he said something to my friend and gave the regular admission to my husband after that. So not sure if its 2 or 3 free admissions with that bank card).

There's lots of art work here since it is a National Gallery Museum. But kind of a bit disappointed. It was more of a mixture of arts throughout parts of Asia, England..etc. Not too much Singaporean arts so kind of disappointed on that part. I truely believe you should come here early because its a huge museum. We spent 2 hours there but had dinner reservations so we didnt finish it all. The hallways are also a bit confusing as theres no arrows or a direct way to walk through it. So you can get a but lost inside as well.

National Gallery Singapore,Sarah N.,22/8/2016,"What a stunning museum and great use of repurposing two beautiful old buildings.  I was so glad I chose to stop into the National Gallery Singapore during my recent trip to Singapore.

If you are an art obsessed person like myself, you could easily spend an entire day here.  My time was limited and I enjoy modern and contemporary art more than anything else, so I chose to focus on three things: 1) The Level 4 Gallery and Wu Guanzhong Gallery, both showing modern artists for limited time installations 2) Level 5 and galleries 13,14 & 15, which all are contemporary artists and are part of the permanent installation and 3) the ""Building Highlights"" tour (offered in English and lasting about an hour).  

Now the National Gallery Singapore only opened November 2015 and I was under the impression that all I might see was more sedate Southeast Asian art.  In my brief visit, I was completely wrong and was blown away by the modern, edgy stuff on display.  Not only is the building a magnificent architectural wonder of old meets modern, what great edgy work by artists of Asia now!  

Now I will go back on a future visit to spend more time in the bulk of the Southeast Asian Art (which really is the bread and butter of the museum), but so happy to see the contemporary piece too.  

There are like eight food and drink options on sight and not to mention the very cool Gallery & Co gift shop.

National Gallery Singapore,Nik T.,8/12/2015,"finally, a museum singaporeans can be proud of!
just 10 years from pm lee's mention to fruition.

i must say they did a great job carving out this historic space, sprucing, preserving, conserving and finally, beautifying it to it's current magnificence.
every corner you look, there is something of interest to the lens.

now, where do i begin?
how about that i have never set foot into this compound until 2015?!
amazing isn't it?
sure, many a photo shoot took place outside but never inside.
sure, i used to play rugby on the lawn fronting the now national gallery. 
but being inside is a grand new experience for me.

you might get a little lost the first time you are in here.
so be sure to grab a map from any of the handy and helpful guides littered around the grounds.
for a more interactive approach, do download the gallery explorer app available only for iphone and ipad(for now).
or call a yelp friend in ally t and she will be more than happy to be your guide!?;)

i like how much space there is, relative to the crowd. 
you can take in the arts, in relative peace. 
maybe the tour groups have yet to descend upon the gallery in throngs?

as for now all singaporeans get in for free!
so bring your pink ic and students, bring your student pass!
register at the ticket counter and they will give you an entry sticker, then you are free to roam.
free, wifi enabled roaming.
take selfies, wefies, etcs and upload relentlessly!

i like how you can get up close to most of the art works and sniff the oil on the canvas.
just kidding, but there are no physical barriers, just black lines drawn on the ground to demarcate no fly zones.
no overzealous staff to spoil your enjoyment, as you wander around without restrain.
just don't damage any pieces by accidentally falling into them!

there are also places both indoors and outdoors where you can sit and relax before continuing with yet, more viewing pleasures.
so sit, relax and take in the view of MBS or the reflections pool or just people watching in general.

and as and when you are sick of all the audio, visual arts, kid's art, pop-up art that bombards you, just chill at one of the many new f&b outlets that are equally stunning.

What amazed me about the new National Gallery was their southeast Asian art galleries. They had artworks dating back to the 1800s from this region, and it truly fascinated me. 

As a person who loves museums, I've always admired European paintings though I could never relate to them. However, when I noticed the artwork by Philippine artists, for the first time I actually felt connected to the art. It's hard to explain. I guess the idea of seeing portraiture and thinking, ""Wow, this family looks like me!"" or ""Wow! This is how Filipinos used to dress back then! Is that what my ancestors wore?"" helped me understand where I came from. Being born American with Filipino heritage, it was as if I finally experienced my heritage for the first time.

There is so much to see here that I was truly overwhelmed and couldn't do it all in one sitting. I definitely want to come back and re-visit the galleries that focus on contemporary southeast Asian art, along with re-discovering identity post colonization. 

If you're into photography, bring your fancy camera.

National Gallery Singapore,Rob L.,27/4/2018,"The National Art Gallery is located in two historical buildings with British Colonial style architecture - the City Hall and the former Supreme Court building.

There are many exhibits and the main feature is called ""Siapa Nama Kamu?"" which means ""What is your name?""  The paintings all reflected the rich history and culture of Singapore (and the surrounding Southeast Asian countries).  The main theme is to examine issues related to Singaporeans as individuals as well as a community, and to see Singapore through its art.

Outside the main gallery (DBS Singapore Gallery) is the Social Table, which let visitors digitally choose a collection of artworks and build their own posters (see picture).  Once you are done you'll enter your email address, and the poster will be emailed to you in a jpeg file.

This is REALLY cool because the artworks that you select represent how you see Singapore through its art.  Each person's selection is unique; each person's perspective of Singapore is different.  Your selection is your answer to the question ""Siapa Nama Kamu?""

In the picture posted, you can see yours truly's view of the culture and evolution of Singapore through its art, and my answer to the question ""What is your name?""  My name is my image of Singapore.

Besides the main feature, there were numerous other exhibits and galleries.  There are literally too many to mention, but two of them are particularly memorable:

-- Rediscovering Treasures: Ink Art from Xiu Hai Lou, which is a collection of Chinese painting and calligraphy.

-- Walk, Walk, Walk: Search, Deviate, Reunite, which is a digital collection from Japanese ""ultratechnologists"".  These high-tech artworks respond to the visitor's touch, movement, body heat, and voice.  Absolutely amazing!  (This is the first gallery to your left as you walk away from the ticket counter, and is naturally the first gallery to visit.)

If you are a lover of art, history, and culture; allocate at least half a day to truly enjoy and appreciate the National Art Gallery.  To kill two birds with one stone, while you are there, have lunch or afternoon tea at the National Kitchen by Violet Oon (please see separate review.)

I hope you'll enjoy your visit.  Before you leave, remember to ask yourself the question: ""Siapa Nama Kamu?""",5,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YlGb0sEoZQWtoZj4zwZjng/o.jpg,Siapa Nama Kamu?,Arts

National Gallery Singapore,Fernanda F.,29/3/2018,"Honestly, I was super excited to get to visit the National Gallery of Singapore, but it was a little of a disappointment. 

One thing that I thought it was really cool about the Museum is that they have the largest collections of art from South East Asia. I think most National Galleries around the world, focus so much on artists from other countries, that they sometimes forget about their own local ones; so I was really happy to see that Singaporean artists were given the recognition they deserved in this Gallery. 

The main reason why I'm giving it 3 stars is the way is set up. I swear I spent 50% of my time here trying to figure out where to go. We got lost like 5 times, and it was really frustrating to just walk to empty or closed rooms. After a while we realized that a bunch of exhibits were actually closed, so it was a bummer that nobody let us know in advance, instead of wasting our time trying to figure out where to go. At the end we just felt so lost and cold in that huge building that we decided to leave.

Try to go on a weekday, othwrwisethe lines are ridiculous. Even on a Monday, the lines in the special exhibit were ~10 minutes for each of the 4 areas. 

I'm not that familiar with Yayoi Kusama, but there is a pumpkin sculpture at a mall where I live, so it was kind of exciting to see more of her work. I wish they'd give you more than 20 seconds in the infinity light room, especially because you have to go in with strangers...

National Gallery Singapore,Ry T.,28/5/2019,"This is really a nice museum. Spacious, clean (especially the bathrooms) and the artworks are not all cluttered closely. The museum encompasses 2 separate buildings which are joined together by an aluminum roof made to feel like a modern art forest canopy.  In their prior lives, one building was used for municipal services and office for the Prime Minister.  The 2nd building was for their justice dept  and where the Chief Justice's office was. 

The proclamation of separation from Malaysia can be seen in the former office of the past Chief Justice.  Lovely art work over 5 floors. But the bottom floor is mostly play areas for kids. There is a roof view with a solar pond. We had a small lunch at the restaurant that serves local food. Another serves Western food. The beef satay was delicious for $9, 5 small skewers. Hubby tried the seafood laksa. It was very good too, over rice noodles.

National Gallery Singapore,Denise C.,11/12/2017,"This art museum in the heart of Singapore is fantastic. It's definitely worth visiting in Singapore if you love art and modern buildings. Yes, it is newly renovated. It has a fantastic interior and even sensors for their escalators. I was bummed I wasn't going to Night Safari. We went for a walk near City Hall and I walked by this museum. I noticed the signs for Monet and Raden Saleh, and I told my father I really wanted to visit. They do have student discounts, so I got like $5 bucks off and paid $25 for all access admission to Century of Light exhibit and general admission. I really was impressed with this museum. There's tons of art to see. If you like Asian watercolors, there's some. If you like modern art by Asian artists, there's a lot of that. I am so happy I saw some obscure art. I am so used to seeing American artists in San Fran. So, the key exhibit was the Impressionist art. All pieces on loan from Musee d'Orsay in Paris. I was happily going through the exhibit until some mean bossy woman told me that my camera was making noise when taking pics. I saw her tell on me to a person working there. That was so rude. I mean get over the camera noise and get over yourself entitled American lady! Just walk away yourself. Besides that, I really liked seeing the Rouen Cathedral piece by Monet there. Really great. Who doesn't enjoy Impressionists like Monet, Renoir, Manet, Pissarro and Cézanne? Then I liked the Raden Saleh(from Java) and Juan Luna(from Philippines). Really great to see SE Asian art. 

The museum is a bit confusing. After getting your tickets, I would go to the Info desk and ask them to explain the layout and map. It's really helpful to ask before having at the collection. There's the Supreme Court Chamber and the City Hall Chamber. City Hall Chamber 3rd floor are where the key exhibits are. Supreme Court Chamber has some history and SE Asian art. There's a bridge on 3rd floor to different section. 5th floor has outside terrace with views. There's various nice restaurants in museum even a Chinese restaurant and the classy Violet Oon. There's one gift shop by the entrance and it could have more.

National Gallery Singapore,Nicole L.,13/3/2016,"Beautiful space and Asian artwork, I really enjoyed walking around and visiting the gallery. The building however was not all gallery it was a bit confusing to navigate the gallery skipped floor and all. The roof was interesting it was a pool of water on the top so you could see the movement of the water from below. There was also the supreme holding cell that we visited it was kinda of fun. There were a few cafes and museum stores, random but one carried Maison Kitsune clothes though for man only. The highlight of the visit was going to the rooftop, there was a restaurant up there with an amazing view of Singapore! Worth visiting!",5,arts,,,Arts
National Gallery Singapore,Emerik V.,17/6/2016,"The National Gallery is a beautifully restored building that still has all that grandeur feeling you get from those buildings in similar architecture like those in Europe. Even if you're not that excited about artworks, I believe it is still worth a visit just to walk through the building as it was simply stunning. (a great place to bring your guests i suppose)

The National Gallery also hosts a vast collection of Southeast Asian artworks ranging from local artists to artists from neighbouring countries. Although the collection brings me back to my days of studying those artworks, the arrangement of the artworks felt quite random which makes it less appealing in terms of its presentation as well for its discussion (some museums group artworks with related theme or characteristics together to evoke discussions). In addition, the lack of guidance, whether in form of text or audio, makes it harder for people who are not that familiar to the SEA art scene to understand and appreciate it fully. 

More could be done to introduce people to the SEA art scene but I'm glad that some efforts are being devoted to fulfil this purpose.",3,arts,,,Arts
National Gallery Singapore,Rushdy H.,7/9/2016,"My mistake when visiting the museum is to come in the afternoon. The place is humongous and we could only cover half of the museum before retiring. Great collection of Art inside a beautiful and historical building. Don't forget to check out the view from the rooftop of the Padang and the Marina Bayfront.
I would have given it another star if it was easier navigating the building. Got lost midway with a dead-end and had to backtrack, which ruined the rhythm.

A gigantic underground basement connects the two as does what used to be an alleyway between the two (but which is now ""covered"" to become a link way). It's disorienting moving from one side of the museum to the other. There's a lot of space (much underused) and it's almost too big, which adds to the feeling of being lost. I didn't have time for walking on my own as I'd joined a tour. The tour was enjoyable and instructive. The docent seemed knowledgeable and engaged us.

The museum is very modern and pretty. Several things to see besides Singapore's past history, also modern growth since the 1920s onward in the upstairs area and an animated 3D area with a sky fall of flowers and a forest of local animals, habitat, and flowers. I found it to be dark for the animated portion but it was very pretty. 

There is a section which talks about all the colonial occupation of Singapore including the Japanese occupation during WW2 and the suffering endured by the Singaporeans. When we were in Japan 2 yrs ago, the museum in Japan made their war invasion sound like a patriotic thing and how their citizens suffered and the recovery efforts after they surrendered.  No mention of their atrocities to the countries they invaded nor regrets or public apologies.

National Museum of Singapore,Helen W.,17/8/2017,"I was visiting Singapore for a few days, and as someone who is used to dry heat, the Singapore humidity is a lot to handle, especially midday. As such, it was important to us to find things to do that would be both interesting and allow us to escape the heat. One of the things we did was to check out the National Museum.

As the name suggests, this is a museum dedicated to all things Singaporean. The exhibits detail Singapore's history throughout the years, and smaller exhibits will go into more detail of certain eras or certain facets throughout the ages (e.g.: pop culture, fashion, plants). Even if you're not a huge history buff, I think that you can definitely find something interesting.

One of my favorite exhibits was the special Story of the Forest exhibit created by teamLab. It has digital images projected onto the walls. Maybe not everyone would find it interesting, but I happen to be a fan of teamLab's work!

Although all the descriptions are provided in English, they did have handouts in 3 other languages for non-English speakers. This was useful for my mom, as she reads and understands Chinese a lot more easily than English.

I give this place three stars because most of the exhibitions here are from other countries. Yes, granted that people of Singapore did come from many other places and they're all immigrants so to speak but there aren't many interesting contents in the museum apart from the time when they were colonised by the Great Britain.

Basically the museum looks at the whole period of the city from the prehistoric eras, through colonialism, World War II, and the birth of the Island republic (and the problems that arose therein).

1942-1945 WWII struggles and occupation. 
1945- present how Singapore separates from Malaysia and becomes an independent nation. This part was fascinating, as they ran authentic news coverage of the President giving his speech of the changes that were about to happen.

Try the exhibit downstairs, which makes it interactive. Children will have fun with the treasure hunt activity.

The one area that stopped me from giving five stars: high priced food at Cafe Brera. We were looking for a cultural experience but the cafe is pretty standard western fare at an exorbitant cost. 

Traveler's tip: for a bit more of a cultural immersion, take a break for lunch, leave the building (make sure your museum stickers are on you so you can return), cross the street over to the Singapore Management University and take the escalator down to their basement to reach their canteen/food court. Just ask any student to point you to the right direction. The food there is diverse, excellent, and you will probably get the full family fed for the price of one entree at Cafe Brera back at the museum. Hot tip: try the Korean hawker for some amazing kimchi dishes (they can make it vegetarian on request).

National Museum of Singapore,Christie S.,29/1/2023,"I came here for the doraemon exhibition and I didn't really walk to the other parts of the museum so this review is mostly based on my experience for that exhibition. 

I was raised in Asia and I grew up watching doraemon so I was really excited when I found out that the national museum of Singapore was holding the doraemon exhibition when I was there! There were three parts to the exhibition--two of them were in the basement where they showcased the doraemon modern art pieces and the third one was on the ground floor where they showed the original drafts of the manga. 

Right outside of the exhibits in the basement, they had a very cute Doraemon themed cafe where they served dorayaki. I didn't really try it since I'm not a big fan of red bean but it smelled good and the price was pretty reasonable! The art pieces in the exhibition were really cool! It was very interesting to see artworks of doraemon with a modern twist and my favorite ones had to be the ones with Takashi Murakami's flower! They also sold some limited edition merchandise outside of the exhibits that were difficult to find anywhere else! My boyfriend and I couldn't help ourselves and bought a puzzle and a magnet that were made based on the Takashi Muramami's Doraemon art! 

Overall, my boyfriend and I had a great time here! The staffs were very helpful and nice and the directions was very clear. If you have a chance to come, don't forget to go to the second floor!

National Museum of Singapore,Lydia K.,4/2/2017,"A born and raised Singaporean, my first trip here was long overdue. This is a world-class museum of the history of Singapore, with plenty of interactive audio and video exhibits to tell Singapore's story from its roots as a sleepy fishing village to bustling global city-state. 

I thoroughly enjoyed my visit and spent 5-6 hours here by myself. I explored every nook and cranny and there was always something exciting to see. 

One of the highlights of my trip were the Glass Rotunda, which houses teamlab's Magic Forest interactive exhibit. If you're familiar with teamlab you'll know they make the most entrancing, magical interactive exhibits. When you first enter you'll be captivated by a large room with magical plants projected on the walls swirling around as ambient background music enveloping you. Amazing. There's also a larger room like that with comfy bean bags that you can lounge in and just soak in the atmosphere. I loved it so much I visited twice. 

Another highlight was the exhibit Life in Singapore: Surviving Syonan. It documents life under the Japanese Occupation and was completely fascinating. I've heard stories of the occupation but never visited an exhibit showcasing the documents and personal accounts beforehand. There is also a cute room with a heartwarming story of how a couple fell in love during those harsh times. This exhibit gave me great insight into the Japanese occupation and I loved every moment. 

The main exhibit, History of Singapore, is large, comprehensive, and beautiful. It covers Singapore's entire history and I believe Singaporeans and tourists alike should visit! 

Admission for Singaporeans and Permanent Residents is free - just flash your IC - and it's only $10-18 for non-residents. If you're on a budget, skip the special exhibit that's going on right now (what is not visible is not invisible) because it's not really worth $8. Its the kind of art that is only art because of what the artist writes about it. 

There are two cafes and a restaurant to choose from when you get hungry. Clean and beautiful bathrooms are everywhere. The architecture of the museum is both traditional and modern and will take your breath away. 

Overall an amazing museum. It makes me proud of my homeland and to be Singaporean.",5,arts,,,Arts
National Museum of Singapore,Joyce L.,8/4/2018,"It's always a good thing to learn a thing or two about a new place when traveling.  We visited the museum to learn more about Singapore's past, present, and future. I loved the exhibits and the artistry the museum offers!  Great for the whole family.  

Did I mention that there's AC and escalators?!",4,arts,,,Arts
National Museum of Singapore,E. C.,1/7/2020,"I love this museum! It is an awesome way to learn about Singapore's history and a must visit! 

First of all, on the day I went there were very few people at the museum. I practically had it all to myself! I checked in and got my temperature taken really quickly. The tickets are a little expensive - $15 for adults, $10 concession - but once you go inside you won't regret it.

I first went to the Singapore History Gallery. There were a lot of cool artifacts, books, maps, letters etc. Lots of interesting stuff about Lee Kuan Yew. Some of the highlights were a rickshaw, replica WWII tank, replica 60's HDB kitchen, and LKY's Rolex watches. Definitely don't rush through this gallery - take your time and see everything. Don't skip the paintings, they are like windows into the past. Great learning opportunity.

Next I went to the Glass Rotunda. It's just like a light show. Wonderful photo and video op and cool animals. Although if you don't go - ehh, you're not really missing anything.

Lastly I checked out the second floor exhibits. The haunted spiral staircase is pretty cool! In my opinion the best exhibitions on the second floor are the Modern Colony and Surviving Syonan. Modern Colony had a lot of old dresses, shoes, etc. Very interesting to me! A museum employee (forgot to ask his name) gave me my own mini tour about how Malay became the national language of S'pore and how LKY united Singaporeans through culture. He was obviously very knowledgeable. Surviving Syonan is my favorite. It's all about the Japanese occupation of Singapore in WWII. You can hear the survivors' stories too.

On my way out I stopped by the gift store. The books are all really interesting, wish I had bought one or two. As I was getting hungry, all I got were two postcards ($1 each, not bad). I didn't go to the museum cafe, but if you are a seasoned traveler like me you would know better than to eat there.

Overall this museum is an awesome place to beat the heat and learn about Singapore's unique history. I highly recommend it!",5,arts,,,Arts
National Museum of Singapore,Jac S.,31/8/2012,"The rather iconic colonial white structure and dome really stands out in this part of town, and it's quite a lot bigger than one might think. 

The gift shop at the front entrance has an interesting collection of Singapore-designer souvenirs which make for great gifts for tourists to pick up. I enjoy visiting the various exhibitions from time to time - the last one I saw was the wedding dress one, and I'm also a fan of the swinging lamp installation on the second level.

Parking here can be expensive! You might be better off parking at SMU instead and taking a quick walk over...",3,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ab5Q4OoSR-ycqP_zBHI21g/o.jpg,,Arts
National Museum of Singapore,Flora Y.,24/8/2012,"As the name suggests, the National Museum of Singapore is one of the biggest museum in Singapore. With frequent installations and rotating exhibitions, there is always something new to expect from National Museum.

There are many different types of exhibition there, from artefacts to film, photos from the past and even interactive exhibitions. It holds a lot of history and cultural facts about Singapore, a good place to learn and appreciate the place we call home.

At the gift and souvenir shop, it holds a lot of creative and unique stuffs about Singapore, from badges to T-shirts. Cups and mugs! I even bought myself a 'Choy Charm' which was simple adorable. Really cute items sold there, most stuff are suitable for gifts too!",4,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tyFGbs705oGfMBeid0vDbA/o.jpg,,Arts

I love the architecture of the National Museum and the interior too which is a nice simplistic white. There is a swinging light installation on the second level by Suzann Victor - titled ""Contours of a Rich Manouvere"". They have housed popular exhibitions such as the ruins of Pompeii, and more recently, famous art works from Europe and more. Admission is free for all tertiary students.",4,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PyPh4D27nta7IbT32rgZ8Q/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-Qam-lrr33LYTdjwy5Yfnw/o.jpg,,Arts
National Museum of Singapore,Jannet L.,22/11/2016,Really nice building where we spent some time waiting for our battle box tour. Learned about the history of Singapore which I didn't know much about. Really liked the sculpture or is it a display of all the pots and pans making a huge sphere in the entrance. I didn't have time to see the rest of the museum but apparently goes into detail for specific eras in history. I enjoy historical museums a lot more than art museums so this was good. I think entrance was about 7? 10? But worth it to get outta the rain.,3,arts,,,Arts
National Museum of Singapore,Young K.,3/10/2019,"Any nations you go for the first time it is respectful to learn  about their history and culture. A museum like ""The National Museum Of Singapore"" would be the best example. Underneath the glitzy hotels, and swanky retails.  lies a more profound Singapore. A history that started with the entire nation being tropical agrarian land.  Before the arrival of the westerners,  it was more ""Man Vs Wild"" than ""Crazy Rich Asians "".  
    It starts off with the indigenous people aka the Malays and their methods of cultivating land. Then the arrival of Chinese mainly from provinces of Hainan and other parts of south China who arrived as early as the 11th century. Both groups worked along side each other in the jungles. Later traders from India mostly from Tamil arrived. Museum murals depicted how each of the groups worked side by side.
    Later segments in museums depicts the arrival of Europeans and especially Stamford Raffle the founder of modern Singapore.  It focus the control of Singapore under the British East India Company. It was still a colony with current day Malaysia known as British Malaya  until 1962 when it joined Malaysia as a soverign nation. 
     Rest of the museum focused on its succession from Malaysia in 1965 and the formation of todays Singapore which is the modern metropolis of success.",5,arts,,,Arts
National Museum of Singapore,Matt R.,28/2/2015,"The NSM's permanent exhibition was being revamped for the nation's 50th anniversary when I visited, but I can't imagine I would have enjoyed it more than the ""Singapura: 700 Years"" which very thoughtfully presents Singapore's lengthy history of human habitation. I'm guessing here that it was way more rewarding for this visitor than any bus tour around the city could have been. We also got complimentary Chinese New Year photographs and enjoyed a comfortable if unmemorable lunch in the restaurant.",4,arts,,,Arts
National Museum of Singapore,Jasmine X.,31/8/2014,"So this review is solely for my visit during the Singapore Night Festival 2014. The National Museum is very much a centerpiece of the Night Festival, and they open it up with a bunch of cool exhibits for free! As a tourist, it was really exciting to be able to check out the museum. When I went, they had a really neat exhibit for young photographers and a pretty interesting, in-depth history exhibit on Singapore's past. Very informative. It's also a huge museum--there are three floors, I believe the top floor is a play area for younger children. All in all, great experience and I was glad to be able to stop by while during the festival!",4,arts,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Q-Tv7AidN-ncsrUPhiJT6A/o.jpg; https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8G5oP4IhH_Z9pmuXFRhx3w/o.jpg,The front of the museum on the evening of the night festival; History exhibit,Arts

National Museum of Singapore,Shu Ling T.,12/8/2012,"This is possibly the museum that I have been to the most! It is located just a little distance away from Dhoby Ghaut MRT station, and the building is easily recognizable. Apart from the special exhibitions, there are several permanent exhibitions at the National Museum that tells retells the history of Singapore. It includes the Singapore Living Galleries (namely on food, fashion, photography, fashion, and film & wayang) and the Singapore History Gallery. For the living galleries, I would say I enjoyed the section on food the most! It is really telling of our country's culture, colorful and vibrant. There are even videos on the process of preparing the local dish, which keeps people interested and easy for tourists to understand our culture as well!

I like the Singapore History Gallery as well. Firstly, it takes on a story telling approach, which makes it more engaging. It covers the major national events in the development of Singapore, as well as personal stories of people from the past. It comes with an easy-to-operate multimedia handheld device called the companion, which facilitates the audio visual tour. The device is available in four languages, namely English, Mandarin, Malay and Japanese. 

Definitely a place to visit once in a while, and to introduce to your overseas friends when they come by Singapore for a visit!",4,arts,,,Arts
National Museum of Singapore,Stephanie N.,27/8/2016,"Fantastic place to learn about Singapore's history. I spent about 4.5 hours here but could easily have seen more.

National Museum of Singapore,Andrew T.,12/10/2017,"I think this is a good way to get a little picture of how Singapore has evolved over the years - there are several galleries that cover sort of one or two decade stretches of time, and those are really interesting and presented in very engaging and creative ways. The main Singapore history gallery has information dating back to about 800AD and forward to the economic powerhouse that it's become - careful to point out that Singapore existed before Raffles landed and ""started"" it. Plus for the WWII buff in me, the downstairs traveling exhibit covers the experience under Japanese occupation. I wish some of the exhibits had gone in to a bit more detail - I'm the guy who loves the most minute details about some of this stuff, but all in all, worth visiting. More expensive than the nearby Asian Civilizations Museum, but definitely covering very different content.",3,arts,,,Arts

National Museum of Singapore,Gloria W.,13/8/2012,"The national museum is one of the more popular local museums. There are always interesting international exhibitions going on, with a small section bringing the traveling exhibition to a local context. For example, in the recent Wedding Dress exhibition from the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, there was a small section on local traditional wedding outfits and symbolisms such as the cheongsam. In the exhibition on treasures from Ukraine, there is a bit at the end describing the importance of gold in Asian cultures as well. 

The permanent exhibitions are also quite worth exploring to find out about Singapore and our history. The Singapore History Gallery, in particular, offers a very personal interactive experience with your own audio companion and different paths that you can take throughout the exhibit. My only complaint is that there is insufficient time to cover all the exhibitions in the building in one day, which is a pity as there is so much to see.",4,arts,,,Arts

National Museum of Singapore,Ash T.,25/11/2018,"Absolutely phenomenal. The NMS is one of the best museums I have every visited.  Beautiful building with terrific architecture both inside and out. For the main admission fee of $15 SGD, you get access to several art galleries and two exhibits on Singapore history. There is also one special exhibit that you need to pay extra for, which I opted not to pay extra for.  The art exhibits are okay (full disclosure I only had time to check out two), but in my opinion, the stars of the show are the history exhibits. There is one of the first floor that offers a fairly comprehensive overview of Singapore's history starting from pre-European contact through the present. I felt like I really learned a lot about the different eras in Singapore's history and there were plenty of cool artifacts, along with mNy different oral histories that you could listen to by picking up the receivers places along the walls. The past 100 years of Singapore was a smaller exhibit upstairs in a beautiful wing of the building. This was split into four parts, each in a different room: pre-war colonial era (through 1930s), Japanese occupation (1940s), post war / independence (1950s and 60s) and the beginning of the modern era (1970s and 80s). Each room gave an interesting snapshot of the era depicted. My favorite was the last one covering through the 1980s. It was quite elaborate, with a giant mosaic screen in the far wall facing two rows of stadium seats that were taken from the original Singapore Stadium. The screen changed every 30 seconds or so to show a new scene. There was also a second smaller room behind the giant screen that was set up like a drive in theatre complete with mock up cars that you could sit in to watch the short film that was playing on repeat. Brilliant.  Visit this museum. If you don't, you're really missing out.",5,arts,,,Arts

Prior to my trip, I took a quick glance of the country's background so I was happy to see the collections of trinkets.
