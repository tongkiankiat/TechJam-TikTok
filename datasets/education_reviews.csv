"Little Woods Montessori","5","We are so grateful that our son's first school experience was with Little Woods. We visited 16 Montessori schools to select the best and most authentic Montessori school and Little Woods was the best one. Pro: School Director's teacher learned directly from Maria Montessori in Sri Lanka (the closest lineage one could find), aircon, loving, kind and passionated teachers, fun outdoor space with cars, tricycle and garden, clean, quality montessori equipments, wonderful yearly show for all classes, comprehensive quarterly reports, communication app, regular photo reports).","2024-08-06T10:15:37.546Z","0","Sandrine Dreeny","96","true","2025-05-27T06:45:37.000Z","Thank you for your kind and generous words.

"Little Woods Montessori","5","LWM is a fantastic school.  We did not want a place that would be too heavy with academics on an 18-month-old but rather a place that would teach our daughter how to socialize, learn about the world, make friendships and have the type of school experience every 18-month-old should have.  We got that and more.  Such caring teachers and administrators, a bright friendly atmosphere and a focus on excellence in what they do, makes LWM a great place.  Highly recommended.","2020-03-18T04:03:40.584Z","0","Martin Alintuck","1","false","2025-05-27T07:00:20.000Z","Thank you for your thoughtful review.

"Little Woods Montessori","5","I had stalled sending my son (second child) to preschool after we moved to Singapore simply because I could not find a preschool that was as wonderful as the school his older sister had attended in our home country. I visited what seemed like every single preschool in our area and none of them ""clicked"" for me. That was until I visited Little Woods Montessori in Gentle Road. From the moment I stepped into the light, bright and beautiful ground-floor converted home - I knew I had finally found my son's preschool! The surroundings are so wonderful for a young child, it really feels like a home away from home rather than a learning institution. I was most impressed that day by witnessing what the children were doing. The activities are so wonderful for the body and mind. My son has absolutely thrived at Little Woods Montessori over the past two years. His fine motor skills are absolutely amazing and his knowledge of the world is beyond his years! The teaching and environment has been so incredibly nurturing. It is wonderful that they get to play outside on the grass playground in the fresh air every day! I have always felt that my son has been in safe hands and the teacher to student ratio is very low so they really get to know your child so well. As a family we have greatly enjoyed the Open House exhibitions over the years and have been amazed by what our son has created. Our only regret has been that we did not keep our son at Little Woods the whole way through until Age 6. We moved him after two years to his older sister's international school for the sake of convenience. At the international school, he is just a ""number"" and I have now realised just how incredibly high the teaching standards and care were at Little Woods! So I would have two pieces of advice for anyone wishing to send their child to a preschool in Singapore: First, you cannot go past Little Woods Montessori for the environment and quality of teaching and care. Second: Leave your child at Little Woods for as long as you can, you will find the standards of teaching and care at the ""big"" or international schools do not compare! We miss Little Woods so much and are very thankful for the incredible time our son has had there and for all of the valuable things that he has learnt.","2020-02-27T03:20:06.241Z","0","Nicola Peck","8","false","2025-05-27T07:12:04.000Z","Thank you for your heartfelt review.

"BMTC School 4 (Rocky Hill Camp)","5","Tired of staying in the city center? This resort is the perfect getaway!

After a 1h transit from the far East of Singapore, you can disconnect from the world in a place where signals literally cannot reach! Let your mind and body recharge with the relaxing view of the rainforest for as far as the eye can see, and enjoy ready-made meals designed to optimize nutritional content! At night, you can enter a deep, peaceful slumber to the soothing sounds of machine gun fire and grenades.

There are plenty of activities to keep you entertained! From the concrete running track in the middle of an unsheltered field, to the swimming pool that is chlorinated on a regular basis, you'll find yourself in top physical shape in no time! You can interact with exotic wildlife, such as monitor lizards, centipedes, mangrove vipers and even king cobras! You'll also have plenty of abandoned buildings to explore at night, just don't get too friendly with any of the residents.

All these and more, for the low, low price of your hair, your NRIC, and your freedom.

"BMTC School 4 (Rocky Hill Camp)","5","I would definitely recommend staying at this resort for all tourists planning to visit Rocky Hill Nature Reserve. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in the deluxe 16-man forest villa as our suite enjoyed a panoramic forest view, as well as a beautiful view of the hotel lobby (parade square) from the balcony. Guests of the resort are sure to encounter some of the exotic native wildlife such as primates, bats and several avian species. If you are lucky, you may also be able to partake in a unique safari experience where the wildlife comes inside the villa itself, offering you a more intimate and unique experience. However, guests are advised to hide any snacks inside their state of the art metal finish wardrobes. Speaking of food, the resort offers a more pleasant dining experience than the Tekong Riviera Grand Hotel, but you may find the chicken a little… medium rare but also quite dry and stringy. additionally, the fried rice or noodles are occasionally dripping with oil… how generous! despite some minor drawbacks, the bistro here certainly offers a finer dining experience than the dining halls at Ladang, and i must commend the variety of assorted free-flow beverages provided. Guests can also look forward to enjoying the weekly yacht service which shuttles them between the main island and the resort. The hotel staff are also not exactly friendly and shout at guests from time to time, but were still marginally better than what i expected before my stay here. Despite the apparent poor service of the staff, i still grew to see them with much endearment, and so did i enjoy sharing a suite with my fellow guests. Overall, i would say this is truly a unique resort concept, especially for those looking for an immersive ah boys to men experience.","2024-06-22T14:00:38.977Z","0","xignyu","2","false",,,"en","Edited a year ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNMdWFfRFVBEAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNMdWFfRFVBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xf538b0378927ad8f!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICLua_DUA%7CCgwIhrLbswYQwOeF0gM%7C?hl=en","101012839936651142456","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLnNrvYSvFWuz04I3wxNdpTLo4GX25dT8WKaKTP60cX_QbtCw=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101012839936651142456?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"BMTC School 4 (Rocky Hill Camp)","4","School 4 is around 4km away from the rest of Tekong Resort's schools. Travel time depends on how fast your tonner driver wants to go and whether he cares about passenger comfort when going over the 1001 speed bumps on Tekong Highway.

Here is the place where you really feel like you're in the army. You will hear the glorious sound of gunfire day and night. You will also be close to nature and experience real-life combat when you have to fend off monkey raids. If you're lucky, you might even come across a pangolin.

Despite its remote location, Rocky Hill has everything you need - well-equipped medical facilities, a swimming pool and the best food on Pulau Tekong. Like the other schools, you will also have a complimentary 5-day outdoors experience, where you can bathe in the organic and natural mud of Pulau Tekong.

And to recruits, if you end up here you can give up on your M1 subscription.

All needs are still met in school 4 thou and arguably the food has been noted to not be as fresh from the main complex. However cell signal is still strong in this neck of the woods abiet this was about 10 years ago now.

Interesting the craziest thing that happened was birds ? flying into the window because they didnt expect a building in the middle of the jungle.

"Basic Military Training Centre","5","Tekong is like a pilgrimage for the bois.
This place will change you inside out for the better, free of charge plus you get an allowance of an intern for 2 years while others not serving are earning more. Its like you are given a challenge quest to survive 2 years with fix allowance.
If you survive this, you'll survive anything the world throws at you.

Don't go toilet alone btw, call your buddy to follow you.

Major Cons: You might risk losing your GF, or maybe not.
Major Pros: You get to weed out fake love easily, it's not a test for you, it's a test for her. lol

"Basic Military Training Centre","5","⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ""Best All-Inclusive Bootcamp Experience in Singapore!""
Where else in Singapore can you get free food, free transport, free lodging and still get paid for showing up? That’s right — welcome to NS, the country’s most exclusive all-male wellness retreat (ladies, your turn is coming 👀).
Think of it as a 2 months-long all-expenses-paid bootcamp:
Meals provided (portion-controlled for maximum gains!)
Transport included (you will march to your destination)
Accommodation in charming shared rooms with authentic military décor (read: bunk beds and no aircon)
Fitness plan so effective, you’ll never need a gym membership again.
Weight gain? Not possible. You’ll lose calories just from standing still under the sun.
The staff (affectionately known as sergeants) are super hands-on and very vocal with feedback. Sometimes they yell, but it’s only because they care... deeply about uniform standards.
Highly recommended for anyone aged 18+ with a strong sense of patriotism, or at least no legal way to say no.
Pro tip: Always carry a water bottle, and never — never — ask “Why?”. Just say “Yes, Sergeant!” and everything will be fine.","2025-07-04T08:04:50.616Z","0","Mark","35","true",,,"en","a month ago",,"Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21obFFUaDRNWGhmVjNReFozcFZhbll6UkROalNIYxAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sCi9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21obFFUaDRNWGhmVjNReFozcFZhbll6UkROalNIYxAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xa4a08d8e7c262f25!3m1!1s2@1:CAIQACodChtycF9oOmhlQTh4MXhfV3QxZ3pVanYzRDNjSHc%7C0cOsgXZiea_%7C?hl=en","106892004602374154320","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIWQbRVfrYXXcxvFrL9bDOPb6uEGA2yhqDgh6kQJ0iXQPe-Yw=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106892004602374154320?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"MindChamps PreSchool @ Pasir Ris","5","Our son has been attending MindChamps Pasir Ris for the past two months, and our experience so far has been very positive. As a first-time mother who practiced full-time caregiving for the first 18 months, transitioning to preschool was a big step—not just for our son, but for us as well.

While he still cries at drop-off, he now verbalises that he enjoys school and adores his teachers. We’re especially grateful for Ms Banu, Gu Lao Shi, and Ms Pearlyn, who have shown great patience, care, and attentiveness. Their nurturing approach has made a meaningful impact, and we’ve noticed our son learning to respect both authority and his peers—something we truly appreciate.

The recent parent-teacher conference only reinforced our trust in the school. During the 45-minute session, Ms Pearlyn and Ms Banu took the time to understand our concerns and worked with us to brainstorm practical, thoughtful strategies tailored to our son's needs. It was clear they see him as an individual, and we felt genuinely supported as partners in his development.

The school itself is clean, very new, and well-maintained. We also appreciate the emphasis on sensory play and Chinese language exposure. A big plus: our son hasn’t fallen sick once since he started, which speaks volumes about the hygiene standards in place.

One small point of feedback would be the lighting—it tends to be on the cooler side, like in an office. We hope there might be a way to introduce warmer lighting in certain areas to create a cozier, more relaxed vibe.

Overall, we absolutely recommend MindChamps Pasir Ris. The teachers are dedicated, the environment is safe and enriching, and most importantly, our child is learning and growing in a space where he feels seen, supported, and secure.","2025-06-05T03:18:08.362Z","0","Phoebe Pang","6","false",,,"en","2 months ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VMdnQtLXVmdzVDbDJ3RRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VMdnQtLXVmdzVDbDJ3RRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x17060f02b61a9aa3!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKELvt--ufw5Cl2wE%7CCgwI8JiEwgYQ4JnarAE%7C?hl=en","111490622571464956303","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKWDccTooAl8sfX_V-wFzRZtBfISaGzBoimLAALphs2E5WnFw=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111490622571464956303?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"MindChamps PreSchool @ Pasir Ris","5","We recently enrolled our child in the playgroup at the Pasir Ris Mall center, and it’s been such a positive experience so far. This is our child’s first time in any kind of school setting, so everything is new—for both the child and us as parents! The teachers have been incredibly patient, caring, and clearly take pride in what they do. They work so well as a team and create a warm, welcoming environment for all the children.

We really appreciate how they bring in extra support when needed and keep us updated on our child’s progress—it’s reassuring to know that they’re so attentive and proactive. I am writing this after just one week of school,  we can see our child slowly settling in and adjusting to the new routine, which brings us a lot of comfort.

"MindChamps PreSchool @ Pasir Ris","5","My 21 month old daughter has recently started PG with Mind champs at Pasir Ris and had a great experience with the school. We actually enrolled her into another premium school previously but felt very uncomfortable with the school just after 2 days as we felt the teachers were “too busy” and too overwhelmed to care for her. It felt like she was just one of the numbers in the class. The experience left me and my husband very heartbroken as we were disappointed to see our precious child being neglected at school. However, the experience with Mind champs Pasir Ris mall was a total positive change. Ms Banu (English teacher) Gu Lao Shi (Chinese teacher ) and Ms Kwee Xin (music teacher) were extremely caring and dedicated. They made sure to help my daughter feel at ease, welcomed and gave her the necessary care and attention she needed, even helped to feed and try to finish her meals when she was not adept at using the spoon (the previous school wouldn’t bother and would just remove her food once the time was up if it wasn’t touched ) . We as parents feel blessed and grateful that we found this school under Mrs Koh and Ms Pearlyn’s leadership where they hire teachers who genuinely love children. Our daughter almost immediately loved her teachers and would even tell us that she wants to go to school just after 1 week of starting. Thank you to the team at Pasir Ris again!","2025-04-09T12:47:30.106Z","0","Grace Lio","8","false",,,"en","4 months ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURJbHVhbm5nRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURJbHVhbm5nRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x17060f02b61a9aa3!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgMDIluanngE%7CCgsI4tjZvwYQ6ODwMg%7C?hl=en","114563846513836363587","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWXGPZOM0s5CA3C8SmZJeWWv_ZcUezt4CC1bpR-a0NPxkRr17Ou=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114563846513836363587?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"MindChamps Performing Arts PreSchool @ Changi Business Park","5","Mindchamps @ CBP has given us parents a peace of mind for the 5yrs that our child has been with the school from PG-K2. Our child  has always enjoyed going to Mindchamps and looks forward to interacting with his classmates and teachers.

The teachers throughout his Mindchamps journey has been nothing but wonderful. Caring, loving and with a passion to nurture, our child has blossomed in the time he has spent with them. The school environment is very clean and hygienic, school culture warm and welcoming. The outdoor area is a major plus point for us when choosing a preschool as we very much wanted outdoor play for our child. The outdoor space also doubles up as learning venue for a different kind of exposure and learning experience for the kids.

The Mindchamps programmes are very interesting and we appreciate that they encourage exploratory learning with the kids. Themes are set through each term with activities focusing  around the various themes. Lessons as I hear from our child are interesting, lively and very enjoyable. It’s a brilliant way for young minds to learn. Kudos to the teachers for always going the extra mile to creatively impart knowledge.

Feedback from us parents are taken seriously and always addressed promptly which is something we appreciate a lot. Parent teacher conferences are held periodically on top of the updates we get on our child. This is always welcomed - afterall it is a partnership between us parents and teachers.

It is hard to say goodbye to such a great preschool. Our son speaks very fondly still of his preschool days and has asked for frequent visits back.

"MindChamps Performing Arts PreSchool @ Changi Business Park","5","MindChamps CBP has a team of dedicated teachers led by Principal Anu- who put in their hearts to nurture young minds.
Our experience with the school, has been nothing but amazing- right from highlighting details about the child’s progress and potential, to encouraging the child with patience every step of the way-the teachers have always had and have ‘the child first’ policy.

Aside the learning and thinking skills imparted, when combined with dance and drama (also an integrated part of the curriculum), truly ensures that the child is blossoming comprehensively- and what’s more, these are not empty words- we can vouch as a first hand experience of this with our child :).

Asides this, what we also really like about the infrastructure/ space of this school - is that unlike a few other preschools which are located in malls etc- this one has a playground- which is really great as the kids can get to be in a more “natural” environment while the teachers oversee all the play activities.

Finally, a very important factor in considering MindChamps CBP has always been how welcoming, engaged and receptive the whole team is right from the start- they always allays any concerns and address any questions the parents may have and this give us the confidence to know that our child is in a safe and conducive environment geared for growth.","2023-03-05T06:23:20.679Z","0","Rohinee Sharma","13","false",,,"en","Edited 2 years ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodk9uQm9nRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodk9uQm9nRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xe12c0128a1a943d2!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDhvOnBogE%7CCgwI2OqQoAYQqLL5wwI%7C?hl=en","110396410714548721065","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW6b_4YmeiGSvGCzN0LxPdyIkLNhCcYhYRPQhUY2J3d7Qhx641V=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110396410714548721065?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"MindChamps Performing Arts PreSchool @ Changi Business Park","5","Wonderful preschool! As a working mum, the staff and teachers at Mindchamps CBP make it so easy for me to juggle work commitments without having to worry about my child's well being and development.

Perfect outdoor and indoor location where kids have a dedicated area for waterplay and their own playground! This was important to us as we wanted our child to spend time in the sun too! Teachers also incorporated learning in the outdoor play to help kids to truly understand concepts.

Teachers are prompt in responding to parents and always see themselves as a team with parents. This is a wonderful way of raising kids. In PG and Nursery, the focus is very much on social skills and interacting well with others while still keeping up with academic developments. In kindergarten, teachers focus on building independence with the kids and preparing them for primary school. Mindchamps CBP also has drama, ballet and music classes so kids are kept actively engaged in their interests.

The staff is incredibly caring and attentive, and I can tell they truly love working with babies. The facility is clean, welcoming, and well-equipped, offering a safe environment for little ones to grow and develop. My child has been enrolled here for a few months now, and I've noticed such positive changes in their social and cognitive skills.

The activities were thoughtfully planned and catered beautifully to both children and parents. From the fun games and crafts to the delicious food and cheerful music, everything was just right to make the day feel special. My son especially loved the zoomov.

It was also a lovely opportunity to meet other families and get to know the teachers better in such a relaxed, festive setting. The smiles on the kids’ faces said it all—this event was a big success! 💫

A big thank you to the teachers and staff for all the effort behind the scenes. We truly appreciate your dedication and heart in making these memories for our little ones.

The mystery case and storytelling activities made learning even more exciting and interactive. It was a great opportunity to understand how our children explore and develop their literacy skills in a fun way. This session provided valuable strategies for us to support their learning at home.

She started with half-day classes, but we switched her to full-day when we noticed she wasn’t getting enough time to interact with others. Since then, she has absolutely loved it. She’s made lots of friends, and the school feels like one big family, where everyone knows each other regardless of class.
The teachers are incredibly caring and create a warm, supportive environment. Sanulya has learned so much through fun and engaging activities. The school’s location beside the park is a huge plus, as the children go outside almost every day to play and explore, making their days more relaxed and enjoyable.
It’s a joy to send Sanulya to Little Seeds because she looks forward to it every day.

"Little Seeds Preschool (TSA - Tampines)","5","Little Seeds Tampines literally saved my child from a traumatic situation in which he was being abused in another preschool. We looked at other preschools but found most of them lacked that personal touch and some were run like bootcamps, putting excessive academic pressure on their charges. He blossomed under the balanced curriculum and genuine care of his new teachers and found firm friends there whom he still keeps in touch with, even now. When we moved to the west, he transferred to another LSP school and we were pleased to see the same high standard of education and care. Also, I am gratified to see that while the school has a Christian knowledge element, there is never any religious indoctrination. I would absolutely recommend LSP to anyone looking for a preschool, not just a faith-based one.","2024-06-24T07:46:36.499Z","0","TH Tan","92","true","2024-08-21T07:46:42.000Z","Thank you TH for this wonderful review.

Excellent facilities, educators, quality of feedback etc. My girl looks forward to school each day. And we do see her progress really well in her speech, confidence and other aspects of her development evey single week.

We did, for a period of one or two weeks, try to send her to another operator but the drop in standard was really alot to accept.

"Kinderland Preschool @ Loyang Point","5","As a first-time parent, choosing the right infant care was daunting, but Kinderland at Loyang Point was a choice I never regretted. I entrusted my first child to their care since infancy and have been consistently impressed, and I plan to send my second child there as well.

The teachers are incredibly personable and attentive, making both the parents and children feel comfortable and valued. They go above and beyond in their care and vigilance. For instance, they were the first to notice my child's cow milk protein allergy when it could have been easily dismissed as colic. This attention to detail gave us significant comfort, showing how closely they monitor each child's health and well-being.

"Kinderland Preschool @ Loyang Point","5","We started sending my daughter to Kinderland. It started with my first call to ask for availability. It was a Friday, they took down our inquiry as the principal was not around. Shortly after we received a response from the principal and arranged for show around the school. We thought it was a small compound from the outside but we were wrong, as the school went through a renovation in 2018/2019 to expand its facility. The principal explained and shared patiently what we asked as we were anxious to find a school for our daughter. She assured us that the teachers have been working with them for many years as we do not want to stress our child with high teacher turnover. My daughter cried for 1st month as she was unfamiliar with the routine, fast forward 5 months later she is enjoying school everyday. The teacher will update us if they notice if my daughter was feeling unwell, recently she had an ear infection. We felt that we picked the right school for her as the teachers’s care and attention were most important. Recently we celebrated ur daughter’s birthday at school, we are surprised that teachers and principal coordinated with us as we like to have unicorn-theme (we supplied the balloons) and our daughter was thrilled when she saw the decoration. She was over the moon! To the teachers, this is one of the many celebrations they had but it meant something special for us as we didn’t expect that they were so supportive. All of us enjoyed the party.

"Kinderland Preschool @ Loyang Point","5","Highly recommend Kinderland to parents looking for infant care services for their little one @ Pasir Ris.
The teachers are all so patient and attentive to all the kids which can be seen during drop-off and pick ups!

Located at the mall, the school is air conditioned and secured. The team takes great pride in ensuring the kids are well taken care of and learning in a clean and safe environment.

Working parents can also conveniently grab a light breakfast or coffee to go after dropping off their kids which can be done in less than 15 mins (grace period for free parking 😉).

My experience so far have been worry-free and a breeze and I hope all parents get to share this with me.","2024-07-12T15:19:55.926Z","0","Melrize Ng","8","false","2024-07-16T07:54:23.000Z","Dear Melrize, thank you for taking the time to leave a review for Kinderland!

The teachers and staff in Kinderland at Loyang Point are genuinely caring about each child well being.

Their curriculum is thoughtfully designed to stimulate young minds. They incorporate music into learning to make learning fun and educational.

The facilities are well-maintained and clean, which create a confident knowing that our child is in a secure environment.

Communication with the preschool is excellent. The teachers keep us informed about our child's progress and any developments in the classroom. They also encourage parental involvement through events, workshops, and open communication channels.

In conclusion, they have exceeded our expectations in every way. It's clear that they prioritize the well-being and development of each child in their care and we are very happy that our kids have grown up well in their care.","2024-07-09T01:43:20.553Z","0","annie ng","3","false","2024-07-09T02:17:33.000Z","Dear Annie, thank you for taking the time to leave a review for Kinderland!

"Kinderland Preschool @ Loyang Point","5","In my opinion, the best childcare!!
I have 3 toddlers and they grew up from infant in this childcare, the teachers are very dedicated, very observant and very responsible.

I have heard of horror stories from my other mummy friends whose children are in other childcare and I thank God I didnt experience any at all, given 3 children in this childcare.

Kinderland @ loyang also have tip top cleanliness. I always see the cleaner cleaning when I send my kids to school which is very important.
I have a mummy friend from another childcare whose son hospitalized because of pneumonia, she said it is common, I was surprised to hear because my children seldom have flu attending the school here.

I know of my son's classmates who left this school because they shifted house and told me how they miss this school because the new school teachers lack the dedication to communicate with the parents and cant handle the kids, always calling them to pick the kids up for small issues, disrupting their work.

This childcare has very good dedicated teachers, good communication between parents and cleanliness. My children fall sick minimally, accidents almost never happen, its very important, so I can focus on my job.
And with their substantial curriculum, my children maximize their intellectual potential. There is a difference when we meet other children which I didn't teach at home and they appear to be more confident.","2024-07-03T04:49:00.176Z","0","sarah tay","16","true","2024-07-05T01:33:48.000Z","Dear Sarah, thank you for taking the time to leave a review for Kinderland!

"Little Gryphons Montessori","5","If you're looking for a school where your child will develop both valuable academic and life skills while building meaningful friendships, and looking forward to going to school every morning, look no further.

My son has been attending Little Gryphons Montessori since he was 3 years old. He's now 6 and preparing to say goodbye to the school and the friends he's made over the years. Looking back, I can say for a fact that I have never once regretted enrolling him at Little Gryphons (LG).

This is a school rooted in strong values, with lots of warmth and plenty of heart. It offers a safe, nurturing environment where children are encouraged to become confident, independent individuals. The transformation is evident — children who once arrived shy and unsure gradually blossom into bright, curious, and expressive little people who aren’t afraid to ask questions or share their thoughts. This is a testament to the school’s thoughtful unstifling approach and the positive influence of its teachers.

The school itself is well-maintained and spotless, with high-quality, mostly wooden materials that provide a calm and enriching environment for the children. I'm especially fond of the spacious layout, which emphasizes togetherness.

The teaching staff are nothing short of exceptional — nurturing, patient, and kind. They succeed in the challenging feat of making learning enjoyable for today’s children. A notable sign of the positive culture at LG is its low teacher turnover — in three years, I recall only one teacher being replaced. That level of consistency and stability speaks volumes, and is crucial in the children's development.

A heartfelt thank you to:
- Teacher Jameema, for your genuine interest in the children, your unwavering care, kindness, and dedication;
- Teacher Jess for sparking a genuine interest in Mandarin among the kids;
- Teacher Letchimi, for your irresistible bubbliness and bright energy (never change! :-));
- Peh Laoshi for your sweet, calm demeanour;

And of course, a big shoutout to Jacqueline and Terrence for setting up such a wonderful school. Little Gryphons was everything I hoped for when I was searching for a place where Adrian could thrive. I couldn’t be more proud of the thoughtful, curious, and happy little man he’s become.

To the whole Team LG: Keep up the excellent work. You’re shaping young lives in the most beautiful way - we will miss you all dearly!

My son was in another school nearby, but I didn't quite like it. So fast forward, I decided to send him to LGM. Jacqueline (the owner of the school) is one of the sweetest and loving person to kids, and shout out to all the teachers who are so lovely and patient to my active boy. The environment is so welcoming and my boy is always up n excited to go to school. I've sent my son to 3 different play schools so far, and LGM is definitely the best of all. Thanks a lot Jacqueline, teacher Jameema, teacher Latchmi (sorry if misspelled) and Laoshi for taking a good care of my son in the school.","2022-11-22T01:49:03.632Z","0","Jane Karmendra","47","true",,,"en","2 years ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtNVBlSVh3EAE","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90BuKyQFOR-RxrMF3rc6MymLeu7AMLkRGXw18XX4JScEEyVoWz8m1RHVyqc2egJMmVprJ1vGa85-fgeGha7O5z3zbnnXPXn0je0YPX5eTMqi2wDIb_XRB2VcWmbBSkMoniD0KAN0","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90CG8g95UzprtQiJa_V5vBconJoeFg4dpZBtvB_-rJStBLAdAPsJVh-6I6olq7fwy2rCm2AKdtbDwgcvpjXzdCIASL4GARWXQvSvi2WC41H-qRR7wJRxG7EJ48lJ2nOJVbKYCtEJ",,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtNVBlSVh3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xe2d6e9a8ba8553e1!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgID-5PeIXw%7CCgwIj9XwmwYQuKPdrQI%7C?hl=en","110520911532150487664","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWl-gVO5CteF2UiKf2H-Ybl5aFW_6M-635ZyYNYEzRxeCberlQj=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110520911532150487664?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lessons are based around language (both English and Chinese), maths, culture and practical skills.

The teaching method at Little Gryphons encourages children to explore, to question and to enjoy learning.

The teachers are fastidious in making sure each child is healthy and well enough to be in the classroom. The space is bright, airy and really well appointed.

When we drop him off he runs in with joy and when we pick him up he leaves with a big grin on his face. Which says a lot as our son can often be shy around others, but i guess it helps that the teacher child ratio is good and it is a small and friendly set up overall. The teachers are also very diligent with changing nappies and doing a change of clothes should he get wet or dirty. I would def. recommend this school to parents in the neighbourhood as a fun, friendly and caring school option for their children.","2019-03-09T00:10:14.721Z","0","Juliette Schrakamp","5","false",,,"en","6 years ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvMFB5czh3RRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvMFB5czh3RRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xe2d6e9a8ba8553e1!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDo0Pys8wE%7CCgwI5oiM5AUQyNKQ2AI%7C?hl=en","107489870420846106530","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLmuPY1VefAIvCIxv7cRJ4dvNSI9OWH2NSYikMQIZlIDCxBtA=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107489870420846106530?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Little Gryphons Montessori","5","A wonderful environment where a child can really flourish, grow confident, and get individual care.  My son had been going to Little Gryphons for the last couple of years and it’s such a warm and rewarding school for him to learn.

The student teacher ratio is small, all the kids know one another and they are always given individual time with the teachers to work and learn at their pace. What I really love is how they encourage each student to have their own voice and share it with one another regularly and respectfully.  Topics are taught in a fun and engaging manner, school environment is close-knit and welcoming.  The teachers are just absolutely lovely:  kind, firm, and encouraging in the exact right amount.  I have great peace of mind when I drop off my son and he always shows up at the door during pick-up happy and well tended.

"Little Gryphons Montessori","5","My experience of Little Gryphons:

In January 2018 we enrolled our daughter of 19 months to Little Gryphons Montessori School.

As a working mummy, with a new baby on the way, we knew she would be needing some extra interaction with other children and wanted to settle her in before the baby arrived.  As an expat in Singapore this is not a decision we took lightly as in the UK usually we would wait a few years before play groups and any form of education began.

We visited with Little Gryphons and spoke to several teachers who talked very thoroughly through their Montessori approach daily routine and activities. After sitting down and talking with the teachers we were bowled over with the LOVE, PASSION and DRIVE expressed by all of them.

We left the meeting feeling overwhelmed and truly confident that this was the right descision and perfect school for our daughter.  She started off on 3 mornings a week from 9:00AM – 12:30 AM.  Now nearly 3 yrs old we have increased to 4 mornings as we can’t keep her away!  She is progressing with leaps and bounds (literally).  She smiles every day, sings all day long and her vocabulary is amazing.

While there is a stairway up to the school, it is really not an issue. Once though the door it opens up into a beautiful warm, CLEAN, colourful friendly environment with lots of wonderful artwork and pictures all over the wall.  All of the toys, books and school equipment is of the highest standard which to me this seemed to lack in some of the other schools we had visited.

You are met every morning by a very friendly face and my daughter can not wait to go in to learn and play with her friends.

The teachers here truly do an EXCELLENT job in making sure all the children are happy and extremely well looked after, without failing to follow up with mummy via text messages if there is any concern at all.  On a weekly basis you are sent updates and photos of how they are getting on which also gives you a nice insight into their morning activities.

Little Gryphons Montessori is true to their mission and I can definitely say we could not be happier with the experience they provide …

“Our goal is to provide a safe, loving and supportive environment for children to grow and learn in. We aim to foster creativity, encourage curiosity and instil within children a behaviour of independent learning and self-confidence in order to have an enduring and positive impact on the child’s life.”

We had tried various techniques and even enrol him for private tutoring. But there wasn’t any improvements. I heard about this Center from my aunt and wanted to try as a last resort. He started his classes 4 months back. Before starting this program he wasn’t even able to read basic English. He wouldn’t even try to attempt as he will find it hard and gets demoralised very fast. He went for only 4 months and I can see so much improvement in him. Which gives me the confidence that he will be able to read like others soon.
The Teachers are very friendly and the frequently update us on his progress which gives us a confidence.

"Woodlands Secondary School","5","While Woodlands Secondary School’s cut-off points may not be the highest, that does not define the quality of its teachers or the positive learning environment. As a former student, I can confidently say that the teachers here are incredibly supportive, patient, and dedicated. They go above and beyond to help students reach their full potential, always encouraging and answering questions with patience and care. The school atmosphere is fantastic—students are fun, supportive, and foster a strong sense of camaraderie, with plenty of opportunities to nurture leadership skills. If you’re willing to put in your best effort, the teachers will go even further to support you! Always grateful and proud to be a Woodlander!","2025-03-02T06:02:10.398Z","0","Hehehoho Ng","2","false",,,"en","5 months ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNRbExMZEhnEAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNRbExMZEhnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xd6d46198ff2854a0!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgMCQlLLdHg%7CCgwI4uiPvgYQuLCFvgE%7C?hl=en","110623027338186596900","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKq7N1bCCvccTmFZ1mxF8WvfdQmawg6fK1KZUlB23hkO15s=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110623027338186596900?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thank you woodlands sec for giving your students several chances to prove themselves. I’m so glad I was in woodlands sec.

"Woodlands Secondary School","5","I am really proud to share that I was a woodlander even today. The school leaders and teachers nurtured students who wanted to strive regardless of their background.

The school provided students with several opportunities to participate in competitions and programmes based on their ability instead of just academic performance in tests and exams.

I learnt several life skills, which are  quintessential in my character development till today by being a Peer Support under Mrs Lim, a Camp instructor under Mr Gary Ong, and leadership and values under Mr Thiru. The school provided several learning and life experiences for students like me, who never would have been able to do so unless I was the cream of the cohort in other top-tier schools. I genuinely believe that the school’s holistic approach does its utmost in packaging every student with the knowledge and skills as leaders and better citizens as they graduate from the school as a gift to society.

Thank you, Woodlands Secondary School, for sharing the Wisdom and Truth about life and learning.

"Lumiere Montessori House @ Serangoon","5","Our daughter joined Lumiere at the height of the covid pandemic when she had decided she wanted to go to school. They were kind enough to organise a school visit for us despite the situation and she fell in love with Lumiere on first sight. Having spent Pre-Nursery to K2 here, Lumiere felt more like another family than a school to us. All the teachers are friendly, caring, loving, and know each and every student and their parents by name. The same goes for the children as well, where I noticed that despite the different age classes, most of the children were familiar with others across levels.

My daughter enjoyed her time at Lumiere tremendously and was eager to participate in all the school had to offer. Teachers were always there every step or the way to work together to solve any issues we might face. Lumiere is a warm, close-knit family that advocates for every child and choosing this school was the best decision we ever made. We will miss the school and teachers greatly now that our child has graduated.","2023-11-19T05:55:46.759Z","0","Christine Chng","4","false","2023-11-22T09:23:10.000Z","Hi Christine, thank you for sharing your wonderful experience with us.

The Principal, Ms Serene is very responsible and prompt, many thanks for being meticulous and ensuring everything to be exceeding expectations. Ms Yvonne customises her lessons to suit my French educated K2 while making sure he feels camaraderie with his rather advanced classmates. 许老师, the Chinese teacher actually worked magic, my son speaks to me in Chinese. Effective lessons!

There is so much gratefulness as my child develops holistically, comfortably with the whole team of educators. Friend-mily is whom we chose to be around, we wish we have more time together.

"Lumiere Montessori House @ Serangoon","5","This is the most lovely school! Lumiere Montessori House strongly values the Montessori method within its educational practices and the teachers deliver it to the students in the most caring manner.

The school is very organized with attention to every detail including daily routines for the children, long term goals and mastery of all the essential preschool and kindergarten cognitive elements (numbers, letters, colors, shapes, animals, food items, reading, English and Mandarin, creativity, fine motor skills, gardening, emotions, self care, showing kindness to others, cultural exploration, and so many more!), frequent review/return of school work to display progress made, very thorough/helpful parent teacher conferences, relevant and fun field trips, and regular, real-time messages/updates to parents/families to share all of the joyful experiences at Lumiere. Every paper my child brought home was clearly labeled with her name and what she was learning when she created it, and the food and uniform items she took to school each day came back neatly with her every afternoon. As a parent, this diligence from an educational partner was so appreciated!

The teachers genuinely care about the students and support them fully to learn, grow, and be their best. They create a welcoming, patient, loving, and inclusive environment for everyone at Lumiere, which was like a second family for my child, where students of all ages are friendly with each other and even the youngest Nursery kids call their classmates by name!

My child was always happy to go to Lumiere each day, and I'm extremely grateful for everything Lumiere taught her and exposed her to. As a result of her time at this school, she has excelled from a very young age. I highly recommend Lumiere Montessori House!

"Lumiere Montessori House @ Serangoon","5","Our boy started at Lumiere at the end of March 2022. Unfortunately, we did not have a good experience with an earlier school and we were a bit wary! But right from the start,  the teachers were very approachable, supportive and reassuring!  Within such a short span,  I can see noticable difference in my son in a lot of areas. For instance his communication skills- he is much more articulate, has picked up another language (sings Chinese songs),  is learning to interact slowly with other kids (which was very difficult for him ) and most importantly enjoys the pre-school experience itself!! He speaks fondly of his teachers and all the fun activities that they make him do! He is starting to make friends at school and looks forward to spending time there.  Thank you so much Ms Serene,  Ms Bridget,  Ms Yvone,  Ms Karena and all the rest of you for making such a positive impact on him in such a short span of time. From crying to go to his earlier school to actually looking forward to coming to Lumiere,  this is quite a shift!!
I can't wait to see how much more he will evolve over the next couple of years in his journey at Lumiere with all of your support.  Look forward to our full day partnership moving forward.  Heartfelt gratitude for all your care, support and nurturing! Hope that you can make a similar difference with many more kids and their families!

Most of the teachers are caring and experienced. We can feel they love the children and truly passionate about teaching. Despite the distance from our place we prefer to send our girl there. But we have to withdraw her as we need childcare service.

The principal, Serene has always been so helpful in giving advise also help our girl to settle in when she just started school during Covid period.

We’d like to say thank you to Teacher Evonne, Ms Linda, Ms Erni, Ms Tham and all the Lao Shi who have supported her.

"Lumiere Montessori House @ Serangoon","5","As a 32month old child, our son joined Lumiere. We were convinced he’d take a month to settle in. He was excited to go to school after 2days!! Such was the start enabled by the loving teachers and the nurturing environment.

That same fun, passion and excitement has continued for the next 40 months. As he prepares to graduate from K2, as parents we feel extremely fortunate and thankful to Lumiere for providing him with a happy environment, fun learning, pleasant manners and important great friends for life

There are many views and models for Early childhood learning. We think that Lumiere has struck the right balance between activity-based learning, contextual learning and life-skill development. It is easy in Singapore for people to be overly focused on preparation towards p1, but then that becomes the destination without enjoying the journey.

Lumiere’s teaching models, self-sufficiency emphasis and pedagogical processes enable the journey to be so positive that kids have high levels of aptitude, good attitude and are full of receptivity

We’d encourage anyone out there looking to explore holistic early childhood preschools for their kids to consider Lumiere. Very happy to chat and share our experience as well. Our child and us would continue to stay in close touch with the wonderful school.","2019-11-13T14:05:09.535Z","0","Sridhar Nagarajan","4","false",,,"en","5 years ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwNWFQbHhRRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwNWFQbHhRRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x9aaaee607e62c5c!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgID05aPlxQE%7CCgwIlZuw7gUQsPKZ_wE%7C?hl=en","110679514344985247126","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW92qo6jZBE9GPEd6aHDDzS7ovcijCILTuFsMRDZystAr-dvgk-=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110679514344985247126?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lumiere Montessori House @ Serangoon","5","My twins have been attending Lumiere for the past 3 years (2017 to 2019) and they will be going on to P1 next year. We are very sad indeed to be leaving Lumiere as the teachers have provided allot of support and help as both of my boys are on the spectrum ( albeit Mild). The teaching is very well rounded so not only do they do the usual academic but they also emphasize on character building lessons and activities.
There is the annual charity drive whereby kids learn empathy and to give back to the community.
The school takes in kids who are on the spectrum ( to a certain degree) and the teachers have the supreme patience and are able to handle and teach my kids some self regulation and self awareness. Their 1 to 1 lessons in the afternoon helped initially with the behavior and subsequently it was to strengthen their academic background.

Thank you to all the teachers, Ernie, Serene, Aileen, Anisa, Sarah and lao shi ( chinese teacher) for all the patience and love shown to the boys. Aidan wants to stay in Lumiere FOREVER ( that's what he said).
Sorry if i had missed out anyone.

From the moment i stepped into school, for the campus tour, i loved the environment! It was as though my heart found peace with a school that i can send my son to.

Just as a new mom, i was worried about sending Asher to a school for the first time. However, the teachers in Lumiere are unbelievable :) The way they showered him with love and care, i had no doubt that he was in good and safe hands!

We are always greeted with open hands and lovely smiles every morning and the teachers are always willing to have a chat with me when i need it.

Ms Serene, the school's principal, is awesome! She is so willing to hand hold a kid, not just during the start of school, but throughout the whole year. I'm so so impressed that she thinks for every student, notes down what she can do to help them grow.

This preschool is much more than a preschool, it's a family! The teachers are like moms to the kids! The school is full of infinite joy and laughter!

Asher had the honour of being part of Lumiere for one full year and our hearts are ever so grateful!","2019-05-24T17:32:13.570Z","0","Joselyn Heng","3","false",,,"en","6 years ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZLS1DalNBEAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURZLS1DalNBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x9aaaee607e62c5c!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDY--CjSA%7CCgwIndWg5wUQ4NiTkAI%7C?hl=en","115224476399421356844","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIHZyERpvI6H-Aj-fG6bO8M2e7MWHfd002XNWIS0UHu215krA=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115224476399421356844?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Malay lady always picked on me when I did wrong or even times when I was polite and did no wrong, and once insinuated that I lacked manners (Which was not true at all as I was passive and well-liked by all staff and have never offended any staff before) when she’s the one who ignored me and my mom to chit chat and tend to others after giving us the consent form and even after we have done signing and filling up when my mom came to fetch me as I was ill at the same time my mom was rushing me as she had to go toilet since we have been standing and waiting for 4 minutes just for her acknowledgment after we were done, so I had to help my mom to end it quick and leave, I prompted her “Hi, excuse me” only to be ignored first while she cut short her conversation with the others before turning to tell me in a long whining tone “What is it? Done already? That’s all. Next time wait, don’t interrupt. Have some manners” in front of my mom. Hello! How about you be considerate, responsible and reasonable? My mom has an urgency and I was already ill and all you needed to do was to collect the form and dismiss us while chatting, or better you wait for our form first before you chit chat with someone else! And there was once I had to hand in another form from 9am to 5pm, but since I was busy in the morning, I went at 3pm, only to be scolded by her for being so late when I was within the time limit and not even late or last minute. So I don’t appreciate such treatment. There have been so many bad rowdy unkind students, how about lecturing them? When I kept quiet, also got lectured. Everything also cannot? As a sickly person I dreaded having to go to the general office to be treated like that before getting fetched home. Well done now, I’m hurt by this on top of all the bullying by my schoolmates because of me being a shy passive teachers’ pet unlike the average teenagers. I hope you get fired from this field, or get back the same treatment by someone. One of my biggest regret in life was to enrol in East Spring Secondary School just because my parents made me as it’s right next to my house and like I said I was passive and agreeable with no opinions myself. No wonder the current students are still bad as ever, I’m disappointed.","2025-02-15T23:45:08.313Z","0","ilove2play","6","false",,,"en","Edited 6 months ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURIMGZxRGl3RRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURIMGZxRGl3RRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x37b24b6a56296c2b!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDH0fqDiwE%7CCgwIhM7EvQYQ8PLIlQE%7C?hl=en","108018149738908169316","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUl6UCBNwvVyEMvS_wyFM8LMwmB6N8JACl9zB3s5spnyBSKRCJM=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108018149738908169316?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"East Spring Secondary School","1","This place doesn't even deserve any star here on google review.

I have graduated from here back in 2014. But I think I had enough to say something about this school. I recently came to realization that my current classmate also graduated from this school as well and she withstand the same bs experience here as well (She graduated around 2021.)

At first, I thought it was just me who had a negative experience. But it's not just me.

I endured years and years of hardships in this school. It seriously took a toll on my mental health. Almost anybody who goes in sane and normal also become abnormal. Been bullied... Nobody helped. Been sexually harrased by other classmates, still nobody helped. Teachers also don't give a shit. They cared more about grades than your well-being, with a bit of favourtism at play. The functional daily structure and system in this school was crappy and cheapskate. Everyday, the mantra was about resilience, as part of their school values. Like hello?!?! NOT EVERYTHING NEED TO BE RESILIENT, OKAY? There's this thing called human rights and being treated like a normal human being. Only when I graduated and moved on to poly, then I was referred for counseling.

At first, I thought I must be the only one feeling this way about this school. Turns out it's not just me. Last week, I found out my friend also graduated from here and her experience was hell too.

Anybody thinking of putting their child here in this school/aspire to study here should really think twice. It's not as rosy here as you think.","2024-12-17T09:50:00.582Z","0","Grace Koh Wan Ying","7","false",,,"en","Edited 8 months ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURudC1LMHRBRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURudC1LMHRBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x37b24b6a56296c2b!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDnt-K0tAE%7CCgwIyJKFuwYQyLTmlQI%7C?hl=en","111587429756679128037","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLA-_j4A_BBYnR5ghwxOMHApXdcVNggnxwfO5JvOlO7eD73owwx=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111587429756679128037?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The facility is well-maintained, and the learning programs are thoughtful and engaging. I appreciate the emphasis on both academic and emotional development, which has helped our child thrive. My little one is always excited to go, and we are so grateful for the wonderful care they provide. I highly recommend this childcare center to any parent looking for a quality and loving environment for their child.","2024-12-20T07:53:08.197Z","0","isaac hetdfs","4","false","2024-12-22T02:39:32.000Z","Thank you so much !

"NannySOS Confinement Nanny Agency","5","Aunty Agnes has been providing valuable support in caring for our baby since her arrival. She is meticulous and keeps a watchful eye on the safety of our baby. She is also very experienced and generous with sharing tips about caring for newborns. As we are first-time parents and knew little about handling babies, Aunty Agnes was patient and comprehensive in teaching us how to look after our baby. We learned a lot from her - from bathing, carrying baby in different arm holds to feeding.

She also takes the initiative to make our lives easier - for example, she vacuums our home, places a disposable bag in the toilet for mum to put her used sanitary pads in, records the date of opening the formula milk tin as we don't keep the powder for more than 2 weeks, packs the bag for our polyclinic visits without being reminded to do so, mops the kitchen floor after every cooking. We enjoy the meals that she cooks as well.

Communication with him was also very easy via email and WhatsApp. We got the package that includes the herbal tonic from Heng Foh Tong medical hall. They gave a generous amount of herbal soup and red date tea which are personalized to mummy (they sent a questionnaire beforehand to find out more about mummy's condition), as well as herbal bath packets. They also gave a complimentary slow cooker pot which was very well used for the whole confinement period. All in all, it was a very fuss-free experience with NannySOS.

Nanny Ah Yiew was a joy to have! She is highly professional and very experienced. The one thing we really love about her is that no matter how fussy the baby is or how tired she is, she's always smiling and positive. If she was ever frustrated or upset, she never showed it. By watching her, it also taught us how to be patient and not frustrated when the baby is crying and screaming. She also picked up the baby's patterns quickly and shared with us possible reasons why baby is upset eg. tired, gassy, hot so that we can quickly and effectively calm the baby.

She was also very knowledgeable in taking care of mummy. Once she knew our food preferences, we had great food every day, three times a day. Sometimes also with dessert. She advised what mummy can eat week by week, and also because our baby had jaundice there were certain foods mummy had to avoid. She kept the kitchen clean and neat, even better condition than it was before she came, haha. She also helped with cleaning around the house and laundry.

If we have a second baby we will definitely look for Ah Yiew again. Thank you NannySOS and Ah Yiew!","2025-07-31T04:55:26.996Z","0","Sandy","1","false",,,"en","4 weeks ago",,"Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT210dVV6ZHVkbWsxTVcxRVRURnBaMkU0V1VZMFJHYxAB","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90CibtBQyyD1wNSPoQrk7NCF8UUb5oYf--LdrGcAPrJxn-s-P5fUJvqrPpxaJVXdWjB7vUeF2LPdtXPkGQlBXrxCIkqurYWODICgeA3hly_fs-bfYSHJfe9nezAaT7q7XddJNl17HyaVC8vS","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90BOgSOrLvhPysJ4C2y88pGB5FnppTcPjwORsWY3g4lAIR3edxXAESV2P84PoMWk8GUy27xVKppRR0Kz6MeORfAIC-IWwGstTGaHdMsjrItPpp-BldEnkNrc-RuVmEv7J14pMJzNs-IMNwPh","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90CrmtuZTBIUF_Y3uVLS88OZwod4Wfiv0zUIAthGpGPf0rJ1393xVmXk4e1WfnKzWZMxX0twQ7azgo1hi7WbNTiYFSe-e5ETbywxzkREoSK6m5zmiUWvAL2ir_vmxQRq5pB8kdsNDky7eeY","Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sCi9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT210dVV6ZHVkbWsxTVcxRVRURnBaMkU0V1VZMFJHYxAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x1bded7d65a945c1e!3m1!1s2@1:CAIQACodChtycF9oOmtuUzdudmk1MW1ETTFpZ2E4WUY0RGc%7C0cXjRyvNzAP%7C?hl=en","107999047507989226357","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIQOmrBqbTZSvwV1Ql9GLmMAF4RtfjsNdvblQ1R5ocJ_DTXyg=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107999047507989226357?hl=en",,,,"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90A2c72S1hEAkLg_Ick0afiylz08K42WE0KIb5b6mCwGlW_xZVwO6PategDlKy8SF7OPkfiZAsu6tctTDCmY3JmOH5pXsUix7hIymT3DYiF1YrvrBqx7gJzr1omWJDZTgIwXkfP0s5tkk9p1","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90CSq-oyFq9o0EJy6IAZXH-kiOxH6o5XhbYcaOm3NugPVpVcsXHul64Djbcl0Vutx0PQwr-C9lyK91fno05YiIuc5zKrkwD_qYsoB-qIJUFhn39H32TbohyXgArCyZElyqZXXAPNoME87g","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90CBWsYZNbfxAN4_b3qu5SAqhh1FyXQ9um5fK2VhXugD0J62dPPtFOQWuPPBfK-ag7Ob58BvNprOJNabPqOautbfA5Wi5a92HjzTfMmsLrSZa_4vS7djdM7K9Dt2nPRw2YL9vOo5Rpumdok",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NannySOS Confinement Nanny Agency","5","Aunty Candy came highly recommended by a friend, and I am so grateful to have had her with us during my confinement and the three-week extension. She took such wonderful care of both me and my baby – I was able to rest well and eat so nutritiously under her care.

Aunty Candy is an amazing cook. She prepared different dishes for every meal, every single day, throughout the seven weeks she was with us. Each meal was a delight, and I looked forward to them every day.

Thanks to her, my baby is thriving and growing so well. She helped him get into a good routine with a consistent daily schedule, and he is now sleeping longer stretches through the night.

Most importantly, you can truly feel the passion and love she has for her work. She holds herself to such high standards, and beyond that, she brings so much joy and positive energy into the home. My family and I have really enjoyed having her around, and we are so sad that she will be leaving soon.

If you are looking for someone who will care for you and your baby like family, I cannot recommend Aunty Candy enough. She is truly a blessing.","2025-07-01T14:56:20.551Z","0","Cheryl Ong","11","true","2025-07-23T06:11:06.000Z","Dear Cheryl, Thank you so much for your lovely and heartfelt review.

"NannySOS Confinement Nanny Agency","5","This is our 2nd time engaging Confinement Nannysos , and we are grateful to have Auntie Lilian as our confinement nanny!:)

Having Auntie Lilian is like having your own auntie at your home who cooks delicious dishes and red date tea with extra herbs to help nurse you back to health🥹 i barely drank my red date tea during my 2st confinement, but drank much more this time! Auntie is also very sincere, very real, that she allowed me to drink warm water, though she emphasized that the red date tea is still the preferred drink. Auntie also made her own brown rice ginger tea for me! As a tea lover, i absolutely love drinking this even though i only get to drink this as a late evening drink 😄 (though the best drink is still the red date tea)

Auntie Lilian treats my fam as her own; like steaming food for my 1st kid who has been coughing very badly; and its very warming to see. Auntie Lilian also shared her recipies with us, which i love her red bean pulut hitam dessert and brown rice and ginger tea and ginger milk drink🤤🤤

Auntie is also constantly learning and trying out new recipies and i am a happy food guinea pig😂 Auntie also showed me that i need not include any alcohol in my confinement diet to help me with my recovery, and i am happy because i do not drink (alcoholic drinks). I really enjoyed Auntie's cooking!

Auntie is really experienced, and i like that Auntie is constantly learning! Auntie told me about cold compression when i only heard of hot ones, and even reassured me on things i never experienced with my 1st born. I am happy as whatever auntie told me about my bb, was confirmed by the LC/PD.

Auntie also encourages latching and shares her knowledge willingly with us.

I like that auntie treats my boy like her own grandson :) So definitely thankful for auntie's help in taking care of both myself and my boy☺️❤️ even the massage massuese, from a totally unrelated company, commented that auntie Lilian is very good cos my bb seldom cried when she is here to do my massages! Auntie really loves kids 😊

Thanks Juztin for sending Auntie Lilian to us 🙏 and very glad to have extended Auntie's tenure with us and was thus able to enjoy more of Auntie's cooking and help in taking care of my boy and us😄 thank you Auntie Lilian for taking care of us❤️","2025-05-02T05:07:37.045Z","0","Yi Jun Lim","16","true","2025-05-10T01:56:15.000Z","Thank you so much for your heartwarming and detailed review! 😊

"NannySOS Confinement Nanny Agency","5","We came across NannySOS online and decided on them as their comms seemed more sincere and less commercialized than other bigger agencies. The confirmation process was super smooth and Juztin was always responsive to our enquiries.

We are thankful to have been allocated Aunty Agnes as our nanny - as first time parents, she has been nothing but affirming, encouraging and meticulous. Re caring for baby, Aunt Agnes is careful and on the ball - she supported us in tracking baby's feeds, provided advice and encouragement to normalise and acknowledge our worries, and is responsive to baby's numerous cues. She was also there for every dr's visit and somehow keeps up a much-needed aura of positivity even when we are all tired. It is also clear that Aunt Agnes loves children - it was reassuring to see her carrying and talking to baby when baby is fussing, and baby clearly calms down with her presence.

Aunt Agnes also took great care of us parents and the household. She prioritises our dietary preferences without compromising on confinement needs, and is super organised with a daily schedule of mealtimes and confinement bath preps. She is also clean and organised in both the prep works and cleaning up. As an experienced nanny with families in Singapore, we were also surprised and thankful that Aunty Agnes is knowledgeable about commonly bought + effective medications, baby items and where to get certain groceries locally. This provided us with a much needed peace of mind and support in this challenging period. When we started learning and taking on more of baby's routines under Aunty Agnes' guidance and supervision in the last 2 weeks, she is also encouraging and supportive and would suggest different methods for us to try out to see which works best for us.

Overall, we had a great period of rest and recovery with Aunty Agnes' care and presence. She does not impose traditional confinement practices (e.g. no hair washing), prioritises our needs and comfort, and takes meticulous care of baby and the household. She has been a wonderful source of support through the sleepless nights and dr's visits, and we feel more confident now to manage baby's care :) Thank you Aunty Agnes and NannySOS!","2025-03-26T03:53:44.752Z","0","Jessica Ho","3","false","2025-05-01T08:10:28.000Z","Thank you so much for your detailed and heartfelt review! 😊

"NannySOS Confinement Nanny Agency","5","We are truly thankful to Auntie Ah Yu, our confinement nanny. Not only is she very experienced and knowledgeable with taking care of baby, with the dos and donts while doing confinement, she is also able to bond well with my firstborn and my entire family. My firstborn has a hard time sleeping through long stretch of hours but never once have I seen her looking stressed or frustrated. She is always cheerful, patient and encouraging, like a motherly figure to me. I learn much through our daily conversation about anything under the sun. Not to mention, her cooking is excellent!! My entire family look forward to her cooking every time. I didnt know confinement food can taste so good, so much so that I forgot to take picture at every single meal. If anyone is looking for confinement nanny, I will defintely recommend Auntie Ah Yu!!","2025-03-21T14:11:45.996Z","0","Faith Tan","9","false","2025-05-01T08:07:07.000Z","Thank you so much for your warm and lovely review! 😊

"NannySOS Confinement Nanny Agency","5","This is our second time engaging Nanny SOS for their confinement services. We had a different nanny (Lilian) assigned to us this time, but the service was just as great as our experience the very first time. Both nannies that were assigned to us have over a decade of experience and a wealth of experience, giving us the much needed ease of mind.

Lilian was patient, and took a lot of initiative in tasks. She carefully observed what I needed and prepared them ahead of time. For instance, I have a habit of expressing milk from one breast while feeding the newborn on the other. She’ll ensure that the Hakka is ready whenever she brings my baby into the room for feedings. She also checks in regularly on my intake of red date tea and replenishes it timely.

She’s also flexible, on days that I am unable to cook for my older son she offers to cook a separate portion with less ginger so it’s toddler-friendly.

In the hours spent with her over conversation during meal times, I find her to be a sincere nanny who truly enjoys taking care of little ones.

Would definitely recommend Nanny SOS, and will be back when I have my third child!","2024-12-16T05:06:42.326Z","0","Lydia Liao","10","false","2024-12-24T05:59:41.000Z","Thank you so much for your kind review and for trusting NannySOS for the second time! 😊 We are delighted to hear that Lilian provided you with such excellent care and support, just like your first experience with us.

"NannySOS Confinement Nanny Agency","5","This is our second confinement under Nanny Ah You through Nanny SOS. We booked her for two months straight without any hesitation and it was the best decision ever!

Nanny Ah You checked in on my wife from time to time since she became pregnant with our second child earlier this year.

She once again took good care of my wife, enabling good healing and sufficient rest.

She insisted on preparing the herbal bath for my wife even though my wife wanted to skip it due to the cumbersomeness given our limited bathroom space.
She was especially helpful this time also in training our fresh Burmese helper, coaching her in newborn care and also teaching her many Chinese recipes.
Nanny Ah You is genuinely passionate about children - she is gentle and meticulous with caring for our second newborn, and also interacts lovingly with our toddler.

As she is so reliable - we were comfortable leaving her with our newborn to steal some quick couple dates in our second month.
We will miss her support for our household and her sumptuous cooking.

"NannySOS Confinement Nanny Agency","5","I would highly recommend Nanny Candy. As a first-time mum, I was unsure about what to do after bringing my baby home from the hospital. With her wealth of experience, she was able to guide me to get organised, including what additional things to buy so she could care for baby while I recovered. After I recovered, she imparted her skills of how to take care of baby to me. This was a huge relief.

Under her care, I was able to recover very quickly. She empathised with my low morale because of pain after birth- she was not overly strict, taking over the night duty and encouraging me to get more rest.

Most notably, she has a strong passion for cooking, whipping up absolutely delicious and nourishing meals for my family. She even shared her recipes with my family members when they asked! She brought alot of cheerfulness to my household and we will miss her very much.

Lastly, a big shout out to NannySOS for extending Nanny Candy’s service by another month even though our request was so last minute, a big thank you to Juztin for making it possible.","2024-06-27T11:55:30.642Z","0","Aiyun","6","false","2024-07-16T09:55:06.000Z","Dear Aiyun,

"The Little House (Montessori)","5","TLH is truly a preschool with a difference. We were sad when our son's previous school closed and we had to find a new school for K1. However, it turned out a blessing in disguise because we found TLH. Despite visiting 12 other well-reputed preschools, I'm so glad we chose TLH.

Mrs Katherine, TLH's founder and principal, has a strong vision for the school and how it runs. She is also the most on-the-ground principal I've seen! From being at the gate every morning to welcome the kids, to teaching them, and engaging parents at dismissal/coffee mornings I'm assured her high standards are kept. One thing that struck me when I first walked into the school was how the kids were calm, happy and engaged. I see the philosophy of the school in every aspect of how it is run. Even when I've faced challenging behaviours with my kids, Mrs Katherine has given me advice from her extensive experience and tried-and-tested philosophy.

Mrs Katherine and her teachers also make the effort to know each child individually. During parent teacher meets (and throughout the school year in fact), they share insights that would only come from spending enough time with my child and interacting with him meaningfully.

Many schools claim to develop the child holistically. TLH truly does this and in unique yet effective ways.

My son's previous preschool never brought up his gross motor skills as a concern. At the first parent teacher meet with TLH, they told me it needed working on. I was initially in doubt as I saw him to be adept in the area, especially as we invested time in outdoor play every day after school. However, besides daily outdoor play, TLH also has the most creative races/obstacle courses that train different muscles. A year later, my boy started martial arts outside of school and surprised me and the coaches with his agility. When I asked him why he was so good at the exercises, he said it's like what they do at TLH!

They have weekly cooking sessions where the kids are given the chance to do everything themselves, even when cutting, grating and stir-frying! Since then, my son started having an interest when I bake at home and independently helps me out.

My son was exposed to science experiments in TLH too. On multiple occasions, he was able to explain how something worked when even my older P2 daughter couldn't. Again, he would cite TLH as his source of knowledge 😄

I find some preschools charge exorbitantly, and I really don't like how that is amplified during the usual year-end concerts. For TLH, I've always felt their pricing was reasonable, whether in term fees or add-ons. They do not charge extra for their year-end concerts, but instead make it a team effort, where the kids and teachers create the props, costumes and backdrops themselves. That said, if you are the sort of parent who likes perfectly polished concerts likened to watching The Sound of Music on Broadway, this may not be for you. Instead, we look forward every year to performances that allow kids to be kids, and are planned, practiced and performed with much ownership from the kids themselves.

One common misconception about montessori schools is whether kids would be able to transit to mainstream primary. My son who is naturally not the most studious, has had an easy transition into Primary school. In K1, he used to not be able to concentrate on work for longer than 10 minutes. He is now able to concentrate and finish 4-5 pages of homework, and still go on to study for tingxie. He is able to follow the structure of formal schooling yet have the confidence to answer questions when he wants to.

Just in case this is all sounding too good to be true - we as parents get no benefit out of writing good reviews for the school. It is testament to how much we love TLH. Mrs Katherine and her team have been a God-send for our family! Thank you, TLH!","2025-02-13T08:12:44.521Z","0","Stephanie Lee","19","true",,,"en","6 months ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNnb01Ha1RnEAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNnb01Ha1RnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xabd31e3a786ede5a!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgMCgoMGkTg%7CCgwI_NK2vQYQ-OjT-AE%7C?hl=en","112029139590341728684","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWGOANlAX-gDb9I18AYQ6GTfv6sbbZKQeGPq2AC-0rxPhNIN5E=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112029139590341728684?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Very impressed with the low turnover rate of the teachers and the love and dedication that the teachers showered on the kids. Out of all my kids, the one who attends TLH is most willing to try to speak Mandarin at home, thanks to the school’s way of learning.
There is a lot of emphasis on parents and school mutual support which I believe is necessary in educating a child.

息子は特に週1回のクッキングとチーム対抗のレースを楽しみにしており、私たち両親も持ち帰る料理やレースの動画を観るのを楽しみにしていました。また、2週間に一度送られてくる写真付きのレポートや、ターム毎の先生との面談で、息子が普段どのように過ごし、成長しているのかよく分かりました。

Additionally, I was able to get a good understanding of how my son was spending his time and growing through the reports with photos that were sent to him once every two weeks and the interviews he had with his teacher every term.

I agreed with Katherine children philosophy generally, but the culture will be thrown into confusion when kids enter rather rigid Singapore primary school system.  Most preschools dislike outings yet this school is able to organize around 12 outings a year, illustrating the effort over comfort.  There are still some cons but this school scores the highest in overall reviews of the 9 preschools.","2024-10-26T14:35:28.436Z","0","J L","60","true",,,"en","10 months ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURYaHBpZlpBEAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURYaHBpZlpBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xabd31e3a786ede5a!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDXhpifZA%7CCgwIsPzzuAYQ-J-T0AE%7C?hl=en","115895047207059770404","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVQlRFHGK6SNMK8EIhLyCwRsTDQ-wXXF0zUW6cpTARUy-mQ2RM_=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115895047207059770404?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The Little House (Montessori)","5","TLH is an outstanding preschool! I highly recommend it.
The principal (Mrs. Katherine) is also the founder and owner of the school. This means that she has final say of how to run the school and sees ideas thru to implementation. It is extremely valuable to have consistent leadership. She anchors and ensures that the school is run up to her high standards and principles, and based on sound research of what is best for children.
The children are taught to be socially aware, responsible and considerate. These and other good habits are inculcated from day one resulting in the school having a calm and cheerful atmosphere. It’s like a home away from home. The school motto is “help me help myself”. There is a focus on confidence and initiative in the context of community. Mrs. Katherine is the model of a skilled and confident person. What better way to teach confidence than to exemplify it authentically! The teachers she selects are of high quality and quite a few have been at the school for many years. This means it’s a stable environment for the children. My child often tells me how much he loves interacting with his teachers. It is a language-rich environment and I have never heard the teachers speak bad English or Mandarin.
This is a mixed age Montessori school. Older children are paired with younger ones and the kids learn social graces within community, not simply in theory. Older ones learn patience, leadership and kindness towards younger ones. Younger ones experience this and have confidence that one day they can in turn be in that role, rather than all children waiting on adults to serve them. All kids learn that they are active, useful and integral parts of their community thru everyday interactions.
When I went for the school tour a few years ago, I was really caught off guard by 4 children coming up to me to see if I wanted a drink. They were going to pour water for me and host me! It is a true testimony as to how TLH respects children as individuals, believes in their abilities, and empowers them, to the point that the children were not unduly afraid of me, and saw it as their responsibility to host me, the guest in their school. I had visited 10 schools before deciding on this one and even my 1st runner up school is a far cry from what happened during my tour here. The other schools basically told the children to not disturb the adult talking with the principal and go do their own thing. Whereas at TLH, while no one interrupted the conversation, the children were instead encouraged to step up. They are not treated like a distraction to the “real work” that only adults do, but they are empowered to play key roles in the “real work”. Imagine the feeling of accomplishment and personal value they feel, and how eager they would be to step up and take initiative again! It shows me how the teachers view the children and their abilities, and natural opportunities that can be seized to build the kids up. To me, these are very well trained and intelligent teachers, and I would be safe to partner with them for my child’s learning journey.
There is an individualised learning plan for each child. Academic lessons like math and reading are done 1-1. The fast learner does not have to sit in a bored classroom learning what he already knows. The slower learner does not have to feel shame and be discouraged to try their best. The kids abilities are intimately known by teachers because of this 1-1 interaction.
There is cooking every week where the children themselves get to cook! One of life's greatest sensorial  experience. And they learn counting, fractions, mass and volume, chemical reactions, new vocabulary and all that academic stuff without even realizing it.
Montessori schools are meant to be so much more than just Maria Montessori's materials. It is the entire ethos and community life, seeing thru children’s eyes and respecting them as valuable individuals. TLH is a Montessori par excellence.","2023-04-01T16:12:23.323Z","0","Wantin Koh","3","false",,,"en","2 years ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOXZTYnBBRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSOXZTYnBBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xabd31e3a786ede5a!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICR9vSbpAE%7CCgwI56-hoQYQqJy0mgE%7C?hl=en","104901306457634955848","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJ-6Z1ezc7ChS4mFDhcuu4EpFsjgiuj5DBtT2Cq4_a8OfUQnao=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104901306457634955848?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3. Self-initiative. They are becoming independent in a way they learn to manage things themselves. Learnt to reduce redundancy and becoming much reliable.

I also visited other kindergartens, but I was really drawn in by the humanity of the principal here. Also, the other teachers are all experienced teachers.
The way you look at and watch over your children is wonderful. One of the deciding factors was the excited expressions on the children's faces when we went on the tour.
My eldest daughter attended the school for about 2 and a half years, and my youngest son went there for about 8 months. During that time, there were times when I was worried about my child, but having a reassuring teacher made me feel at ease.
For the past year and a half, events have been restricted due to the coronavirus, but the events held at schools before the coronavirus were also very wonderful.
I decided to try Montessori without knowing much about it. I felt that the warm and friendly atmosphere of the nursery school was a place where children could live their lives to the fullest.
My parents and I both love The Little House.","en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They have been attending for over 2 years and 5 months, respectively. It is a very good kindergarten. I think that the daily support of the teachers and Montessori-based education help children to develop their independence and expressiveness. I feel at ease because they are learning phonics in English. Chinese lessons are also available. When a friend asked me for advice about kindergartens in Singapore, I would recommend The Little House without hesitation, and the biggest reason for this is the sense of security. Along with the kind and passionate principal, you can see everywhere that the teachers with plenty of experience are keeping an eye on each child. This includes the school bus. In addition, the PDF of each child's activities (with photos) that is sent to me regularly is very useful for understanding the atmosphere at the kindergarten and as an opportunity to talk to my child about daily life at kindergarten. I would like to keep it safe and digital. Before enrolling my child, I visited several kindergartens, but I am very grateful that I found The Little House.","en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The Little House (Montessori)","5","This was the first kindergarten I viewed after we moved to sunset area. I stepped in an old fashion glass door and got a warm welcome from Mrs Katherine. She enthusiastically walked me around while introducing how the classes would be carried out etc. We walked to the outdoor area, kids were happily playing in the small garden. There came a little girl, she saw me and came close to me. Before I realised, she poured me a glass of water from their snack station, where I saw a tray with couple of glasses stacking up, a jar of water and bananas neatly laying on top of it. That was it. I cancelled all appointments with other kindergarten and enrolled my boy.

My boy was then 4yr8month, he enjoyed going to TLH so much. Every week he told me a new science experiment; a new country with either its language or food; a new role-play with manner; oh yeah, a new goodie he made under the instruction of teachers. I was very impressed. The teachers made it all seemed so effortless, yet meaningful.

I remembered those days, parents gathered outside of the glass door where the kids lined up and got checked before going in school. Teachers welcomed kids with the brightest smile and funny talks. Mrs Katherine stood at her most comfy tree pose and chatted with us, we all started our days with lots of joy and laughter. Of course, most importantly, we knew our kids would have a wonderful school day at TLH.

How can I not mention the year end concert? It was fascinating. Nothing fancy but full of love and warmth. Teachers and kids designed their own stage, no one needed to wear special clothes or make-up. Kids chose what they most comfortable with and what they want to perform. They gave it their best on the stage. It was a pure joy for parents to see the how much their confidence have grown over a year. 2020, the pandemic hit. Teachers in TLH managed to gather all students single performing clips and created a long video. It was heartfelt. Still it seemed so effortless but meaningful.

We strongly recommend The Little House Montessori. It was the best decision to enrol our boy there. Everyday in his primary school life has benefitted greatly from his experience at TLH. Thank you all the lovely teachers in TLH.","2021-06-14T04:29:34.324Z","0","Zidan Sun","2","false",,,"en","4 years ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxMWI3czhRRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxMWI3czhRRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xabd31e3a786ede5a!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICq1b7s8QE%7CCgwIrrabhgYQuMPBmgE%7C?hl=en","101843583857201321709","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU6gDDiSCcXzeuziN0k2TQceUt9DiKaSL-a_FVPo5MXNft0BYM8bg=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101843583857201321709?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The Little House (Montessori)","5","When we moved to Singapore three years ago, we visited about 15 preschools before we chose the Little House Montessori for our eldest child. We are absolutely thrilled with our choice, and this year, our younger child also started at TLHM.

Each child has an individualised education plan, and the teachers are very tuned in to the needs and progress of every child. With their decades of combined experience, they provide a lot of support and advice around any developmental and behavioural issues that your child may face. Our children love the geography lessons, the science experiments, the weekly cooking, the play-based learning, and the structure they get at school. As parents, we love the wholesome (bilingual) environment, the wonderfully diverse student group, the excellent team of teachers and staff, and the inclusive community, all ably held together and led by the head directress, Mrs. Katherine. I especially appreciate the emphasis on good manners, the practical lessons in independence, the focus on the children’s physical development, and the language support given for non-native Mandarin speakers. This is an incredible place for children to spend their early formative years, and I highly recommend the Little House Montessori to anyone who wants to inculcate confidence and a love of learning in their child.","2020-08-17T02:57:40.493Z","0","Divya Alexander","6","false",,,"en","5 years ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDd3MydTRBRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDd3MydTRBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xabd31e3a786ede5a!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICCws2u4AE%7CCgwIpOTn-QUQkJLB6wE%7C?hl=en","113364517456975026721","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJQAx6wKKGOWQTuxnZ7eBQ1u6hDTnkWdwOwNuaiC4NpSR7Y0g=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113364517456975026721?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"SL Education Centre","5","Throughout our time with Susan, we witnessed her passion for teaching and also her desire to really help students excel - not just in their studies but in life as well. Even though she has been in the industry for 20 years, and can hire more teachers so that she can be more hands off, she still opted for a hands on approach to teaching and interact with the kids as if they are her own by choosing to teach herself.

In her lessons, I can tell that she genuinely cares about the students' well being that goes beyond dollar and sense. The students love interacting with her and looks forward to her lessons as she takes the effort to build strong relationship with the students.

For weaker students, she also takes the time and effort to encourage them, while spurring the classmates to do the same also.

Every year, no matter how busy she gets, she makes the effort to know the incoming orientation class as well, so that she knows everyone by name.

"Kidibliss®","5","I engaged Kidibliss for their infant childminding service, and Jess and her team were extremely responsive, readily addressing all my questions and helping me find an infant childminder who lived within close proximity to my residence!

I couldn’t have asked for a better childminder than Jessica ❤️ She’s been caring for my baby since he was 3.5 months old, and I am consistently impressed by her attentiveness. She regularly updates me on how my child is doing, so I always know he’s in good hands. Jessica is not only reliable but also genuinely caring and patient, making sure my baby feels comfortable and secure. She creates a nurturing environment and has been a real source of peace of mind for me as a working mom. I also appreciate her professionalism and proactive approach, as she often suggests developmental activities to keep my baby engaged while ensuring he’s well taken care of.

Overall, I’m incredibly grateful for Jessica and the Kidibliss team for providing such excellent care, and I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a dependable and loving childminder for their little one!

"Kidibliss®","5","Happy to enlist the help of my childminder as my baby's needs are met better than at infant care centres. As a bonus, my childminder is super passionate and has prepared an enriching environment with many activities for baby to do throughout the day. She goes above and beyond, always willing to work with us to provide what is best for baby; curating an environment conducive for sleep during naps, understanding baby's cues, and ensuring screens are kept away from baby. At our request, she keeps a log of activities for the day so that we are not left out of the loop.

Additionally, because there aren't so many kids around, the environment is kept clean and baby has had good health since being put in the childminding program. This is a huge burden off our shoulders.

"MindChamps PreSchool @ Mapletree Business City","5","Mindchamps @ Mapletree Business City is a GREAT school - our boy comes home every day excited to share about what he learns at school, and talks lovingly about his teachers and friends

Every morning, Ms Chong checks on our boy diligently and teaches him to greet the day with a smile 🌻

Every evening, he shares about what he learns - going beyond the academics but also things around the world. Special shout out to his teachers Wu Lao Shi and Ms Adrea who is so patient with him when it comes to learning Chinese and music 🎶

Special shout out to his form teacher Ms Franny. She pours her heart into the job and I see her on weekend birthday parties and kids’ play dates. It is no surprise that she was loved and moved at the K2 graduation earlier… it’s almost like her graduation too as a 2nd mummy to the class. Don't be deceived by her coloured streaks and her tattoo - she’s puts her ALL in the role as an educator, disciplinarian, and most importantly friend. The kids know it too - my boy called her “his best friend” until the other boys bribed him away with Pokémon cards.

The school isn’t complete without the top-down support of Principal Ms Bee. She has the job of managing the school as a business and parents as customers - but we have never felt the disconnect vs. enrolling our boy in a school with a heart ❤️","2024-12-06T04:49:24.584Z","0","The Five Magic Beans","5","false",,,"en","8 months ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURQNTVyZ09nEAE","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90CWW0kNq-Y1lSX_aONUEs2NSBEUuxDEuXF3rkeyRV67_FBvXXeFv6aRqdUmG99uXwYHPrEPN1v2hDrHcIof2LFjBRdEIKK_bWZqED72y-zXAqkQ1--jQeOHL36YWXFhj-TQ0VQl","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90DC1XN5_fJZeTCr6kdk9uP_liDVa0qEFprawWQu5HNAC0seA00txpXVjyY_a6NPo-HH-jyOYWH1wzgpenQfe9hv3MpyFv4ctSwXThg_lYl3BWS-MSi-OuZ_uUF2j35j-piE-SUA","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90BAdBBD-CXVeG1g8DxtwP-HexWoVfbAyLIqROIMjcPW8yrZs3zsTOWJRrOpEQWrgyRj8Qbuh5tVGhyY-TNyqne6G0_wZ4NTs97np2kbSaJuVROBD85ps9IYgN_xB08kafha66wHVA","Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURQNTVyZ09nEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xf448302e6183ac04!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDP55rgOg%7CCgwI1ITKugYQ2MfNlgI%7C?hl=en","104695391448280072185","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocL8rwBTUBKILSP4DOh7myrStZetCgMKvl0aZE_YMQl0BZ4VWg=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104695391448280072185?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"MindChamps PreSchool @ Mapletree Business City","5","I am so grateful that I have found this preschool for my girl. I can see lots of improvement of her after attending the school for almost a year now.
I have enrolled her to mindchamps MBC when she was 2 years old and 8 months.

When she just started that time, she didn't really engage and join the activities with her peers and also quite picky on the food. I need to prepare lunch and snack for her to eat at school. The teachers there are very dedicated , caring and patience with her. They spent lots of effort and encourage her to join the activities with her peers and adapt to the school environment and routine.

Now she can eat all the food provided by school and even at home she also not picky with the food anymore. After playing with her toy or read her book, she will put back the toys and books to the place where she took it. I can see a lot of behaviors changes within this period and she is so looking forward to preschool every morning and always return home with her happy and smiley face.

Thanks mindchamps MBC teachers for all the guidance,  love and caring that you have given to my girl.

"Agora Colearning","5","I have done the rounds of pre schools in Singapore over the past 7 years. I have looked for a preschool that actively cares and listens to the child, never leaves a crying child assuming they’ll ’just be ok’ and a preschool where smiling teachers wholeheartedly nurture the children. Agora is the place! From the first day to the last, the team do everything they can to help the child settle, feel comfortable, develop relationships with all staff as well as other children and their parents. A special mention to Ms Eka, Ms Bell and Ms Pari who have done everything they can for my son - and for me too! Their warmth, consistency, effort, sense of humour and care has been the best model my son could have seen a pre school to be. Sometimes evidence of this is hard to prove in preschools, but I have seen first hand over a year how effective the whole team are at making children feel welcomed, safe and essentially HAPPY. I have learned so much myself from them even though I used to teach myself - it really is colearning! There really isn’t anything like Agora in Singapore - it suits everyone from locals to expats and everyone is treated exactly how they should be - it’s a beautiful hearty place to start your education journey with your child and I can’t recommend enough. Thank you Agora and to the special teachers - you have made me look at my son differently, made me slow down my parenting and given my son space to be whoever he wants to be. He’s only had positive experiences at the centre and that alone is amazing. Even the children are all wonderful - I’ve seen so many progress right in front of me and it’s purely because of the teachers. And to Ms Claire who runs the centre - you are as I’ve told you, an ANGEL! You shine bright and take everyone with you - how magical. I will not be having a third child, but if I ever did, they will be going here!","2025-08-12T15:22:20.301Z","0","Avni","1","false",,,"en","Edited 2 weeks ago",,"Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xWMVZYZ3pjamxyV1hVNVIyVm5hRWxLY1RGMFVFRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sCi9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xWMVZYZ3pjamxyV1hVNVIyVm5hRWxLY1RGMFVFRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xe056400811da3322!3m1!1s2@1:CAIQACodChtycF9oOlV1VXgzcjlrWXU5R2VnaElKcTF0UEE%7C0capkgGxVEP%7C?hl=en","102837162683958642329","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK8a0gMKKg4mUlcunrhyaFPLfzOhgja6HqIAAW8kKk-yRlKUw=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102837162683958642329?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This morning, the teachers and management team at Agora brought all the Play Group students to the beach. Despite the very young age of the children—some as young as 18 months—the teachers took wonderful care of them throughout the outing.
Their dedication, commitment, and tender love were clearly shown. The children had a great time by the sea, playing with sand and enjoying the fresh air. Although it rained earlier, the children stayed dry thanks to the team’s thoughtful planning and alternative arrangements.
It was heartwarming to see the children and teachers so happy, though a little tired by the end. These outings always create special bonding moments between teachers, parents, and children.
Though not the first time Agora has organised such a trip, it was once again a successful and memorable experience.

Thank you, Agora team!","2025-06-06T06:52:55.538Z","0","Alison Chan","11","false",,,"en","2 months ago",,"Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2pCS0xVSnZORGxwZUZkU1IybGFVM0EzYWpkQmRFRRAB","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90Cj0dLaTfLwWS1WTYe4jbXTzvWXEGcbGEV9KH9Q2LKvQsbHlSmLCK8fLg3sDla62VDqtZPExozlLTvmmjrKXVh7JvciSqE71sTzFe-2mY6jf3mTGVnXb6mbFCF2qgziVeZC26ykiFf3A65w","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90DxTOs9qSwf0a17Wj-LrRx3C0FGIPmQLgQIm5CeaFDYR9DqDItQ_zKwjDosF-niJiljLXBg1UPQKwCaa6u76MYGFlaHSi-ySiP91iQrNPYO5IhJj3wEN5WcT4JOW7_JZxmEx-_DJPlM7D4z",,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sCi9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2pCS0xVSnZORGxwZUZkU1IybGFVM0EzYWpkQmRFRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xe056400811da3322!3m1!1s2@1:CAIQACodChtycF9oOjBKLUJvNDlpeFdSR2laU3A3ajdBdEE%7C0cFd06V6EED%7C?hl=en","102483451146945341863","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX_5P-BCq5NsIyR29M7WKJio1cv0bEax-wUg3aOoEq8kUPioG00=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102483451146945341863?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Agora Colearning","5","Aisyah and team are impeccable. We recently celebrated our son’s 1st birthday at Agora Co-Learning Space and honestly, we couldn't have asked for a better experience. From the very first message to the last moment of packing up, Aisyah went above and beyond for us.

The attention to detail was insane — every corner of the venue was thoughtfully arranged, the setup was beautiful, and the whole flow of the event was seamless. She helped us coordinate with vendors, gave honest recommendations, and even secured better deals for us. What really blew us away was how she handled things after the event too — one of the vendors arrived late (not her fault at all), and yet she still gave us a discount just to make sure we were happy. That kind of care is so rare.

Aisyah was also incredibly accommodating throughout the planning process. We had a lot of specific requests — from kid-friendly setups to ensuring the space worked for elderly guests — and she just handled everything like a pro. She even gave us a really fair and affordable package without compromising on quality.

And here’s the kicker: she’s pregnant and still stayed till the very end to help us pack up. We tried to stop her but she just smiled and insisted. Truly someone who puts her heart into what she does.

Thank you Aisyah and the Agora team for making our little boy’s first birthday so special. You really made our dream event come true. Highly, highly recommended — and seriously to the bosses, give this woman a raise!","2025-04-30T01:29:00.396Z","0","Fad Followill","22","true",,,"en","3 months ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNZd0l6eURREAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNZd0l6eURREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xe056400811da3322!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgMCYwIzyDQ%7CCgwI3PnFwAYQuNalvQE%7C?hl=en","111082361323427620405","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIHWK6_Cx9q6XL5ruuKP-A9p2rDJXnuyWmQiahHoX_fxaZN8w=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111082361323427620405?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Agora Colearning","5","As a parent of a neurodivergent child, finding the right preschool felt like an uphill battle. My son, who has sensory and learning challenges, struggled to adapt in previous schools that simply weren’t equipped to support his unique needs. After multiple attempts, we finally found Agora, and it has been nothing short of transformative.

From day one, his teachers have provided not just instruction but deep, intentional care. They have taken the time to truly understand his emotional and learning needs, tailoring their approach to ensure he feels safe, valued, and capable. Their patience, creativity, and commitment have helped him make progress we once thought impossible. He is now more engaged, more confident, and most importantly, happy to go to school each day.

At the heart of Agora’s philosophy is its incredible head of Early Years director, Miss Claire. She doesn’t just manage the program—she listens. She understands that every child is different and ensures that each one is nurtured in a way that respects their individual journey. Her leadership fosters an environment where children are not just accommodated but genuinely celebrated for who they are.

Agora is more than a preschool; it is a community that embraces diversity with warmth and sincerity. If you are a parent searching for a place where your child will be seen, heard, and supported, I cannot recommend Agora enough. I encourage you to visit, meet the wonderful educators, and see firsthand the love and dedication that make this school so special.","2025-02-07T13:03:47.271Z","0","R H","82","true",,,"en","6 months ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURBN09uZ1JnEAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURBN09uZ1JnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xe056400811da3322!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgMDA7OngRg%7CCgwIs4mYvQYQoPqpgQE%7C?hl=en","113829359707103777733","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJzmC2hPdSVSsI3ojDIsIrUMEW4IVT02VjuOlX0tOd7mjb4JKoG=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113829359707103777733?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spacious venue with lots of stuff to keep the younger ones entertained.","2024-08-26T07:58:54.228Z","0","Wong Fuyu","19","true",,,"en","a year ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3aGFhYkVnEAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3aGFhYkVnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xe056400811da3322!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgID7haabEg%7CCgsIvuuwtgYQ2Or1bA%7C?hl=en","108928839948168103687","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXLly05P4XXevo8kn677ru3G3wTsrI9YibeB2pjAdhXnTSZBv8b=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108928839948168103687?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Agora Colearning","5","I recently booked the event spaces at Agora Colearning for my daughter's 2nd birthday. It was a great experience overall from start to end.

1. The events manager Aishah was very prompt and helpful from the moment I reached out to her. She was able to answer my questions and provided advice/suggestions to make the event a more meaningful one for my daughter and guests. It made the whole planning for the event a fuss-free and pleasant experience.

2. The playspace that I rented was very spacious and clean. It came with 3 playing areas for the kids - mini playground, baby gym and kitchen play area. These areas kept all the kids entertained for the duration of the party.

3. There was still plenty of space left for tables and chairs to be set up for guests to sit and dine. Overall, the whole area wasn't cramped and was good for our party size of 30+ guests (both kids and adults).

4. One advantage of working with Agora was their tie ups with their vendors. I did not have to go through the trouble of finding my own vendors. Through the recommendation of Aishah, I engaged a balloon sculptor, bouncy castle and a face painter. Both vendors were not only prompt to come early but were excellent in their services. The kids had so much fun face painting and getting animal balloons.

5. Accessibility was easy even though it was located at Harbourfront Centre. Plenty of parking spaces within the building.

All in all, I would highly recommend working with Agora and renting their spaces for kid's birthday parties.

Would love to show photos of the venues but all the photos have images of my child and the kids of the guests. Apologies due to privacy issues.","2024-08-07T00:51:52.866Z","0","Yin Xiang Chew","19","true",,,"en","a year ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURicWYzN0d3EAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURicWYzN0d3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xe056400811da3322!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDbqf37Gw%7CCgwIqIrLtQYQyJ75nAM%7C?hl=en","108084689743955130907","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLqh8UllLHcOoO25oeHMGfrn2JAxV6B3SLOjK4DuOt5AZyAUQ=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108084689743955130907?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"House on The Hill Mount Sophia - Montessori Pre-School","5","My daughter enjoyed going to House on the Hill everyday. It was here that  we first started drop offs and the teachers and staff  helped  with a smooth transition . She thoroughly enjoyed the activities at school.

Undoubtedly the preschool helped build confidence in my daughter and she has been a little helper at home after she has learnt all the basic skills at school.The best part is that the kids get play time in the morning so that there is enough energy spent . Moreover , parents get to read a story for the kids which we think was so thoughtful.

We had to say goodbye to the school as we relocated and we realise  how much we miss House on the Hill .

Thank you so much House on the Hill team.","2024-11-21T08:08:54.095Z","0","Nihala K V","14","true","2024-12-03T03:00:54.000Z","Dear Nihala,

We couldn't have found a better school for our daughter, who had some speech developmental challenges in the early years, as she prepared for Primary school.

We always liked the Montessori method and it was definitely instilled at HOTH in everyday curriculum. We also liked the community that they built and my daughter continues to socialise with her ""lifelong"" friends made there.

From the teachers to the staff that makes everything run smoothly, we couldn't recommend this school (HOTH) and campus enough.","2024-09-12T07:43:10.337Z","0","Hung La","33","true","2024-12-03T02:47:40.000Z","Dear Hung
It warms our hearts to hear your kind words of affirmation! We are also very proud to watch S’s journey with us through her pre-school years. She has matured a lot and has strong determination to complete her assignments. She also communicates her thoughts and feelings more, and with much confidence too. Your support and trust in us were instrumental for us to partner together for her development. All the best to you and the family!

"House on The Hill Mount Sophia - Montessori Pre-School","5","As a parent, I am extremely satisfied with our experience at HOTH Kindergarten. Since our daughter YiYi started attending, her progress and happiness have been evident. The teachers here are very professional and loving.

We moved to Singapore from China just over two months ago and were initially concerned about the challenge for our 4-year-old daughter to adapt to a completely new environment. To our surprise, YiYi adapted quickly within just over a week, largely thanks to the teachers’ attentive care, The genuine smiles from the teachers greeting the children each morning are heartwarming. Particularly, Ms. Katrina. About three weeks into school, YiYi naturally ran to Ms. Katrina, showing a strong bond they had formed. As parents, we are thrilled to see our child grow in an environment filled with care and following the Montessori philosophy.

I highly recommend HOTH Kindergarten to families looking for high-quality early childhood education.

"Fairfield Methodist Secondary School","1","Went to the open house...
Was very boring compared to other schools.
Nothing attractive...
I went to other schools, this school is not as good.
Food is too expensive, selling frozen yoghurt for $2.
I feel that they are focusing more on religion than studies. Anyway, it's my feelings. It may be true or may not be true.
The cut-off point for non-affiliated students is 7 to 10 for G3. The cut-off point for affiliated students is 7 to 20 for G3. The difference is too drastic. I was really disappointed when I noticed this.
I did not recommend my son to join this school.

"MindChamps PreSchool @ River Valley","5","Mindchamps River Valley has been a wonderful institution and learning sanctuary for our 4 year old son.  He has been with the school since playgroup and is now in nursery 2, and he has come a long way in development due to the dedication of the teachers and staff.

We would like to extend a special thanks to our N2C teachers: teacher Candice and Chen Laoshi for their genuine love and care for the kids, and thoughtful encouragement on how to help the children on becoming strong students as well as great people with good values/manners.  Our son is always happy to go to school, learns so much from the teachers, and will share what he picks up from school with us back at home each day.

The recent SG60 National Day celebration and performance was a great example of how much time and effort the teachers put into their preparation.  We loved seeing how confident and energetic the kids in N2C were in performing their national day song and dance.  It is not an easy operation, and we are truly grateful to have such wonderful teachers looking after our kids!","2025-08-11T05:10:46.135Z","0","Joe Chang","3","false",,,"en","2 weeks ago",,"Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xKbllVWXlUVTUyTFhKNlJsRmlPRkZrYTNsTVdsRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sCi9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xKbllVWXlUVTUyTFhKNlJsRmlPRkZrYTNsTVdsRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x71275adb19dbf988!3m1!1s2@1:CAIQACodChtycF9oOlJnYUYyTU52LXJ6RlFiOFFka3lMWlE%7C0caMhL72GYT%7C?hl=en","107249613595565597876","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLhLcaLnFW64iywcleflPhMyC8vxdPKypWr7yFPcUhkQxE8Tg=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107249613595565597876?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"SSTC Institute","1","This should be proof enough that the owner takes months to reply. Guess it's better than being dismissive or getting verbally abused. Transparency is a laugh when the owner keeps lying about why the salary is not paid. Raising such issues is the equivalent of disloyalty in the owner's eyes.

Students don't really get what they signed up for. Classes are combined often because of business or cost cutting measures. Management is deceitful; workers owed many months' pay. Owner is artogant and abusive. Family culture is akin to that of a dysfunctional one. Spirit is corrupted.

The decorations, food booths, and overall festive atmosphere around the school really captured the spirit of National Day. It made the entire experience so memorable and inviting.

Thank you for making school such a fun and exciting place for her.

"The Schoolhouse Katong","5","We are incredibly grateful for the wonderful experience our daughter has had at this school since Pre-Nursery. Over time, we've seen remarkable improvements in her English and Chinese language skills, and she has developed so many positive habits that we hadn't even taught her at home. From practicing good hygiene to learning how to change her diaper, take on and off her clothes, and put back items where she takes them, to even using her hands to block her mouth when coughing—these are life skills that go beyond the classroom and show the care and thoughtfulness of the teachers.

Our daughter is genuinely excited to go to school every day, and it's heartwarming to see her so happy. The environment here is truly child-friendly, with a spacious, well-maintained outdoor playground that she absolutely loves. In fact, it's her favorite spot to play when we pick her up after school. She also talks about how delicious the food is, and we couldn’t agree more—it smells amazing every time we pass by the kitchen during drop-offs.

Their dedication, patience, and enthusiasm create a nurturing and stimulating environment for him. Their ability to connect with each child and make learning fun is truly remarkable, especially for Chinese language which he rejects the most at home. They effortlessly balances play and education, fostering creativity, curiosity, and a love for learning in the classroom.

Their communication with parents is outstanding, always keeping us informed about our child’s progress and any upcoming activities. They also go above and beyond to ensure my child feels valued and supported, building their confidence and social skills.

I have seen tremendous growth in my son since joining Miss Nanda’s and 李老师class, both academically and emotionally.

We sent two young children, who were still adapting to the Singapore lifestyle here briefly during the summer and could not have been more pleased by the experience they received. The teachers, miss Rachel and Camellia are caring educators and care givers who are natural at appealing to kids. Lorna Whiston provides regular updates of the children during their school days, and was extremely responsive to our questions and adhoc requests. The tuition fees are reasonable for a facility of this quality and the kids get a full day of care with meals and nap time. We were especially happy with the master classes, which includes drama, music and the language enrichment class (Chinese). Both kids were happy and well cared for. I highly recommend this place for any parent who wants to ensure their children receive top-notch services.

"Lorna Whiston Preschool (Hort Park)","5","Today was my daughter’s first day at Lorna Whiston Preschool, and we as parents could only sing praises about the positive outcome we witnessed right from the start. She walked into school so confidently — she didn’t even turn back to say goodbye! That alone speaks volumes about how warm and welcoming the environment is. It’s clear she already feels safe, excited, and at ease in this new space.

My daughter attended the Music Masterclass today and absolutely enjoyed it! She’s already looking forward to the Taekwondo Masterclass tomorrow — it’s lovely to see her so excited and eager to try new things.

What truly stood out was the genuine warmth from the entire team — even the principal Ms Connie personally engaged with our daughter, and that connection meant so much to her. In fact, once we got home, she was already asking for her! That kind of bond made it feel more like family than school.

And to top it off,  when we picked her up, she didn’t want to go home and was already eager to return the next day. As parents, seeing her this happy and excited brings us so much joy and peace of mind.

We’re truly grateful to have found Lorna Whiston Preschool. If this is only the first day, we can’t wait to see what the rest of the journey holds.","2025-07-01T14:31:00.207Z","0","rachel mak","5","false",,,"en","a month ago",,"Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2sxcFlWSlVRWGRRZFRCeFRXSlBVR3ByYWpWSFFVRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sCi9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2sxcFlWSlVRWGRRZFRCeFRXSlBVR3ByYWpWSFFVRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xab33b81fbbe1a89b!3m1!1s2@1:CAIQACodChtycF9oOk1pYVJUQXdQdTBxTWJPUGprajVHQUE%7C0cNz3ZBLuPN%7C?hl=en","108371829283845117724","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW9YrY5YA81rTXOm5nBwxTtUM9xJR7rHGgVbcm67en3mr-tT7Er=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108371829283845117724?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Lorna Whiston Preschool (Hort Park)","5","My 3yo daughter was enrolled into LW before they moved to current Hort Park location, so I was lucky to experience the school in both environments. I remember back in the black and white house, every time I passed by the school playground around 5pm, I saw not only the kids having fun, but all teachers there with the kids, running, chasing each other, laughing, and very engaged. I could see the teachers truly enjoyed being with the kids and love what they do.

My daughter was shy and resistant of going to school before LW. We thought it was just her personality. However since she got into LW, she's been super excited to go to school every day, and whenever I asked her, she would say she ""Love the school and the teachers"".

The school also has a lot more fun filled classes throughout the day, a lot more than usual preschools. They have dedicated teachers for each of sports, music, art, speech and drama subjects, and dedicated space for each subject. My daughter always had so much fun in school that I didn't mind keeping her there for the full day till 5:30pm. She probably wouldn't have had equal amount of fun and engaging activities in a social setting if she comes home earlier.

Still, on top of all the amazing resources and hardware, what's important to us as parents, in the end, is the team working in the school. Despite the fact that they lost their own outdoor space, the teachers mostly remained the same, and most teachers have been there for many years. Tbe fact that they cared so much about the kids and loved their work, made me decide to stay with the school after the move.

I believe hardware is easy to get. But consistently loving teachers as a team, that the kids are looking forward to seeing everyday, is hard to get by. I would strongly recommend this school to anyone who cares about the above factors as much as we do.","2025-03-29T15:38:51.226Z","0","Sherry Zhang","10","false","2025-03-31T02:54:11.000Z","Thank you so much, Sherry, for your kind and encouraging words!

"Lorna Whiston Preschool (Hort Park)","5","LW Winchester has a great learning environment and strong teachers guiding the children. Given LW’s background they are naturally strong in English but I feel that their Chinese curriculum is truly amazing and most of their Chinese Teachers (Native Chinese) are fairly long tenured & experienced. My 9 year old boy started at LW PG at 1.5 yrs, and most of the Chinese teachers then are still around. My 6 year K2 girl is graduating this year and she is able to read many Chinese books by herself which I was personally quite impressed by. She was even able to read most of the common words 米小圈 which completely surprised me. We have not sent our kids to any Chinese enrichment programmes while they were at LW and my boy has been able to cope well after in Primary school. I really attribute that to the strong bilingual environment and strong academic foundation that LW has given my children.

Books are readily available in the classrooms and there are reading programmes. Children also get to bring home 2-4 books every week to read. LW has also done a great job inculcating a love of reading in my children.

Aside from academics, I think their biggest strength is that they have a good balance between play and learning. The children also have a lot of time to play and express their creativity. They truly enjoyed their time in LW and I’m also very grateful to the school.","2021-08-17T02:21:14.459Z","0","simplyr","32","true",,,"en","4 years ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhZ3Y2em9RRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhZ3Y2em9RRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xab33b81fbbe1a89b!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDagv6zoQE%7CCgwImrrsiAYQwPuf2wE%7C?hl=en","115772711373044289000","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIhdj-EgbUBcxvosPYrdE2KDSLFYJG6WEGj3XOQXg6bhzo7mw=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115772711373044289000?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

幼儿园的国庆节目，形式多样，内容丰富！精彩纷呈，孩子们朝气蓬勃，活力四射；表演的非常精彩！让我们感受到了浓厚的节日氛围，也感受到了孩子们的热情！并且展现了他们从小对才艺和对新加坡国家的热爱！整体效果看得出老师们用心良苦，充分体现了老师们的精心策划和辛勤排练！老师把孩子们教育得这么好；真的是可敬可佩！让人感动！感激！感恩！

虽然天不作美，演出开始期间就有一场暴风雨来临，因此也考验了学校高层领导，老师，孩子们如何应对这种突发状况。但是我看到的是整个演出并没有因此受到任何影响；在等待期间老师和孩子们穿着单薄的表演服装依然站立在风雨中等候彩虹的出现！为此看得出整个团队都有着积极向上和奉献的精神！看到这里做为孩子的妈妈为此流下感动的泪水。。。

老师们是孩子们学习的榜样，是他们成长路上的引路人。老师们用爱心和耐心，培养了孩子们良好的品格和习惯。感谢老师们对孩子们的悉心教导，让孩子们健康快乐地成长

My child had only been in the N2C class at MindChamps @ One Raffles Place for four months when they were scheduled to participate in the National Day performance. As a mother, I had been looking forward to this day! I was eager to see my child's wonderful performance and the fruits of the teachers' hard work! It was indeed a feast for parents and children! The kindergarten's overall setting was warm and inviting, Raffles Place was filled with a festive atmosphere, and the costumes were bright and eye-catching, making it a joyous experience for the children!

The kindergarten's National Day program was diverse and rich in content! It was a brilliant performance, and the children were full of energy and vigor. The performance was truly wonderful! We felt the festive atmosphere and the children's enthusiasm, showcasing their talents and their love for Singapore, which they have cherished since childhood. The overall result was a testament to the teachers' meticulous planning and diligent rehearsals. The teachers' excellent education of our children is truly admirable and touching! I am grateful! Thank you!

Although the weather wasn't favorable, a storm arrived just as the performance was about to begin, challenging the school leadership, teachers, and children to handle this unexpected situation. However, I observed that the performance remained unaffected. Even as they waited, the teachers and children, wearing their flimsy costumes, stood in the wind and rain, waiting for the rainbow to appear! This truly demonstrates the positive and dedicated spirit of the entire team! As a mother, I was moved to tears upon seeing this.

Teachers are role models for children and guides on their journey of growth. With love and patience, they cultivate good character and habits in our children. Thank you for your dedicated guidance, ensuring they grow up healthy and happy.

Thank you teachers for your hard work. Your dedication has ensured a joyful and meaningful National Day for our children. Happy holidays!","en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Posso Preschool @ Jurong East","5","Absolutely recommend Posso JE Infant Care! From the first school tour where we were introduced to Chen Laoshi, the in-charge for infant care, we were met with kindness, professionalism, and a genuine sense of care for the infants. The infants there looked so happy and it was so cute that they were welcoming to visitors too!

My boy was there since he was about 5 months old and everyday he is excited to attend school and we can really tell that he learnt a lot of social and developmental skills in school! Chen Laoshi leads a team of 4 other teachers who are all knowledgeable, attentive, and patient with our boy. It is clear they truly have a deep passion for working with infants, especially Chen Laoshi.

The teacher to infant ratio is about 1:2 or 3 at currently, the environment is warm, clean and comfortable for the infants, and there is even an indoor swimming/jacuzzi pool for the infants to enjoy! Whether it's feeding, sleep routines, or playtime, every detail is taken into consideration, and we can see the positive impact it’s having on our boy’s growth and happiness.

Communication is excellent too whether it’s daily updates, or quick responses to any questions we have, we always feel well-informed and reassured, especially by Chen Laoshi who really goes out of her way for the well-being of the infants.

Our boy has sensitive skin and is prone to eczema acting up, and the teachers have all put in extra effort and care to applying the creams for our boy diligently and making sure his skin is well maintained and clean.

Overall, we are truly grateful for the teachers' exceptional dedication. Our boy has promoted to Playgroup now and still misses Chen Laoshi, the teachers and friends over at Infant care! :D","2024-11-13T03:45:42.142Z","0","YiXuan Phua","9","false",,,"en","9 months ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzbk5tcW9nRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzbk5tcW9nRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xfe55396acb27adf9!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgID3nNmqogE%7CCgsI5sHQuQYQ2KDiQw%7C?hl=en","112653536621602195198","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIcnXX6YqARICgYHYm8oB-1pNipnVNHI8OExt9uH8U54uqdag=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112653536621602195198?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Admin side - amazingly quick response for any inquiries from finance to teachers.

School facilities -a huge outside play ground and green patches to grow veggies. My kids could run around and go out to smell herbs and witness veggies grow.

School curriculum - they have varied activities to keep kids happy. My kids' favorites were baking, trampolining and learning Chinese.

Many thanks to the principal, Ms Charmaine. We might have gone else where it hadn't been her passion andphilosophy towards children's eduction when we went for school tour.

"Posso Preschool @ Jurong East","5","We have 3 children studying in Posso since 2015. Our 2nd child will be graduating from K2 this year while our littlest one is in PG currently. The standard of the school staffs, from teachers, to admin, to curricular planners and even the cleaners has always been of the highest level. The dedication of the staffs is obvious to see from their day-to-day duties as well as quarterly excursions and the annual year-end concerts. The teachers must have spent many after-school and weekend hours preparing the props and doing the rehearsal, to make the year-end concert a success. As for curriculum wise, the school is unique in the sense it advocates the ""I can"" attitude and encourages every child to explore and experience, through gardening activities, baking, science experiments and speech and drama. You don't often find a childcare which has its own cookery room, science lab, indoor trampoline gym, garden and water playground! As parents, we want the best for our children and Posso has given us that peace of mind and assurance that our children grow up in a positive and loving environment.","2021-12-05T14:25:57.603Z","0","Cheehian Tan","4","false",,,"en","3 years ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHOWFyb0VnEAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHOWFyb0VnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xfe55396acb27adf9!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDG9aroEg%7CCgwI9ZezjQYQyODjnwI%7C?hl=en","102046988543314530039","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVb5LPfTAPg0KcNLw1yaLzRbHZo_j38xxlOZC9pSK7bt_Y3OVgqOw=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102046988543314530039?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,"Responsiveness, Reliability, Quality, Professionalism, Value",,,,,,,,,,,

"The Schoolhouse River Valley","5","Both my daughters have been part of The Schoolhouse River Vally, and we’ve been with the school for over 6 years now. It’s been an incredible journey watching them grow in such a nurturing and inspiring environment. The teachers here are truly exceptional, dedicated, patient, and wholeheartedly invested in each child’s development.

My younger daughter looks forward to school every day, excited for the engaging activities and the meaningful bonds she’s formed with her teachers. What really sets this school apart is the strong sense of care and connection. Teachers don’t just teach, they nurture, guide, and mould each child to be the best version of themselves.

Thanks to the strong foundation laid here, my elder daughter transitioned smoothly to primary school and continues to thrive in all aspect of a primary 1 journey. As a working parent, I’m incredibly thankful to have such peace of mind knowing my children are in safe, capable, and caring hands.

Highly recommend The Schoolhouse River Valley to any parent looking for a preschool that combines academic preparation with heart and soul.","2025-07-07T12:53:22.347Z","0","Dave, Jinxian Lua","6","false",,,"en","a month ago",,"Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25JMk0wMW9NVWhpZW1WRVVGaG9UR1J1V0VKYUxWRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sCi9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25JMk0wMW9NVWhpZW1WRVVGaG9UR1J1V0VKYUxWRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xd63057a7242df717!3m1!1s2@1:CAIQACodChtycF9oOnI2M01oMUhiemVEUFhoTGRuWEJaLVE%7C0cPwC1JjIXp%7C?hl=en","114127913765816459275","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXyNW64ZuB8gDqSFjNhdv-WBL1jxRp-XORspCrY5lOtsTHn1rCF=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114127913765816459275?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For parents, nothing beats a pre-school you can trust with your kids and Pat’s RV has been the most magical experience for our family. From the principal, Ms Lauren, to the everybody’s favourite, Ms Jean, to the amazing music teacher, Ms Li Ern, and to the exceptional teachers, we are endlessly thankful of how safe and sound we feel our kids are in this Pat’s everyday. We never take this experience for granted and we probably will not be able to feel the same way even in another Pat’s branch, let alone another pre-school. Many of the staff have seen our kids grow up from an infant and it always feels like bringing our kids to extended family. Special shout out to Qiu Laoshi who, hands down, is our younger one’s favourite teacher for the past 3 years - we are simply blown away by the level of care and concern she has shown. Parents who are looking for a pre-school should at least pay the school a visit to see if you are keen!","2025-07-03T14:44:07.773Z","0","Andrew Doong","19","true",,,"en","a month ago",,"Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2poNGIyZDVZVmx1VjNKMVNGSk9WMEpQTFZwVlJYYxAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sCi9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2poNGIyZDVZVmx1VjNKMVNGSk9WMEpQTFZwVlJYYxAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xd63057a7242df717!3m1!1s2@1:CAIQACodChtycF9oOjh4b2d5YVluV3J1SFJOV0JPLVpVRXc%7C0cOdRri67bO%7C?hl=en","102059954391747989354","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIkDkP9uA-EA2Zyxl7yOrQeI69ujSK7NR922kD5qFDmhJ5A9g=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102059954391747989354?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The Schoolhouse River Valley","5","Have you been to school & feel happy every day? This branch of the Schoolhouse is one such school. My daughter has been attending the schoolhouse @ River Valley since she was 3 years old.  She's a happy baby since,  She's 6 now.

They really put into thoughts on how children are developed at different learning stages.  E.g. the deco of this school is based on warm neutral colours. Learning materials are in rainbow colours.  It allows the child to focus better in listening & observing.

The emphasis of "" joy in learning "" is strong here.  Where children knows & build their confidence too.

The principal & staffs are warm & friendly... it makes the children happy going there.

If I were to choose again, I would choose the schoolhouse again.

Thank you Ms Lauren, Ms Jean & all the teachers & staff for making my daughter the journey of preparation to primary school a great one...

"Brighton Montessori HarbourFront","5","Our son started at Brighton in September 2023 at 20 months in Pre-Nursery and he has really flourished from his experiences at Brighton! He was blessed with having caring teachers who nurtured him and took the time to know and care for him.
We also saw great changes come into place once Ms Fairuz stepped in as principal last year. I was thoroughly impressed that she listened to our concerns about nap times for N2 and made appropriate changes to the schedule accordingly.
There are great family days, they involve the parents with learning opportunities for the parents to come and spend time as the teacher with their children, as well as opportunities for parents to see what the kids do at school.
The teachers my son had, Ms Tiffany, Ms Ong and Ms Mandy, made learning fun for him and we can see how eager he is to learn which is so beautiful ❤️ thank you teachers for your time and devotion! We so appreciate you.
They also try and make the best out of the facilities they have and ensure the kids get enough outdoor play as much as they can.
Thank you team HFC Brighton Montessori!! We’re keen to see our younger son experience this too later this year!","2025-04-16T13:06:48.258Z","0","Samuel Tan","9","false",,,"en","4 months ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNvMnRXLVdnEAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNvMnRXLVdnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xda809134973f2844!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgMCo2tW-Wg%7CCgsI6Nb-vwYQyMO7ew%7C?hl=en","100518283849685588994","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIJ3afl_aSkUW0dXfuCK76hZK0WGcvcYxnnap41nnc7QT3_dg=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100518283849685588994?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Brighton Montessori HarbourFront","5","After the new principal arrived, there have been remarkable changes in the school. A wide variety of interesting activities have been added. Now, parents can be more deeply involved in their children's class affairs and personally experience their children's classes, directly understanding how they perform during class. Some parents even have the opportunity to come to the school and act as teachers to give a lesson to the children. All these measures are of great significance. In my opinion, if the class size can be better controlled, it is likely that children will have a better teaching experience, and the quality of teaching will be further improved.","2025-04-11T11:47:29.201Z","0","cindy","4","false",,,"en","4 months ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURJdWNYR1d3EAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURJdWNYR1d3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xda809134973f2844!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgMDIucXGWw%7CCgsI0YLkvwYQsOaGYA%7C?hl=en","105005803356559648672","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKHGsLW3QAd5pgFp68KmTIvFlQAFh2wDgsAq2IFH-FRyIALYw=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105005803356559648672?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Julia Gabriel Preschool | Julia Gabriel Centre, Keppel Bay","5","We have been absolutely delighted with our experience at Julia Gabriel Preschool at Keppel Bay. The dedication and warmth of the staff have truly made a positive impact on our daughter's early education.

First and foremost, we want to give a heartfelt shoutout to the amazing teachers, Fitriah and Lorraine. Their commitment to the children's emotional well-being is evident in everything they do. They create a nurturing and supportive environment where each child feels valued and understood. Our daughter has thrived under their care, growing in confidence and joy every day.

One of the highlights for us as parents is the detailed weekly updates provided by the teachers. These updates are incredibly thorough, offering a clear picture of the week's activities and our child's progress. They have become invaluable talking points at home, allowing us to engage with our daughter about her experiences and reinforce her learning. It's clear that Fitriah and Lorraine put a lot of effort into these updates, and we deeply appreciate it.

The energy and warmth of the head of the centre, Selena, is also worth mentioning. Her welcoming nature sets a positive tone for the entire preschool. She is always approachable and ensures that both children and parents feel comfortable and supported. Selena's leadership is evident in the cohesive and vibrant atmosphere of the centre.

In summary, Julia Gabriel Preschool at Keppel Bay is a wonderful place for early childhood education. The dedication of teachers like Fitriah and Lorraine, combined with the high-energy and welcoming leadership of Selena, makes it a standout choice.

The campus location is great and safe (at the marina thus minimal traffic and super simple pick up/drop offs), superb natural light in the school (instead of those fluorescent lit dingy hole in the wall schools/classrooms), big outdoor play area, stunning views and extremely attentive staff.

Coming from MindChamps, I was honestly not expecting a huge change given that my son already liked school. But ever since we started at JG, he has been begging to get to school early for breakfast (he is not a morning person at all but wakes up without a fuss) and sometimes even requests to return to school after school ends.

He has become more outspoken, confident and happier overall. Biggest plus being that he is exhausted and knocks out early every night.

We have been through several schools but nothing compares to JG. Can’t wait for my younger son to join his brother there.

This school location is very new (school was in Turf City so far), they have very beautiful, spacious classrooms and an even more beautiful outdoor playground, where the kids play every day.
The school atmosphere is very warm and inviting, the teachers are great with the children and speak English very well and the principal, Selena, is very involved.

"Julia Gabriel Preschool | Julia Gabriel Centre, Keppel Bay","5","I'm particularly impressed with Julia Gabriel Preschool's curriculum, especially their focus on speech and drama, as well as their engaging term assemblies. These activities provide abundant opportunities for children to unleash their imagination and build confidence through acting and play.
My son attended K1 and K2 at Julia Gabriel Preschool (formerly known as Chiltern House, Turf Club Rd), and the progress he's made academically and personally has been remarkable. He's grown more independent and enthusiastic about learning, a significant shift from his experience in N1 and N2 preschool.
The teachers and head of the center deserve immense credit for creating a nurturing environment that combines structure with enjoyment. Their efforts have not only fostered my son's academic growth but also supported his social development. Witnessing his thriving interactions with classmates has been truly rewarding.
Overall, our experience with Julia Gabriel Preschool has been overwhelmingly positive, and we're grateful for the pivotal role they've played in our son's education.","2024-04-28T12:36:22.028Z","0","Canny Chow","11","true","2024-04-29T06:10:34.000Z","Canny thank you so much for writing such a wonderful review and  for sharing your positive experience.

They were able to make friends and assimilate quickly and my youngest has now joined them. All of them look forward to school and I can tell they are well-loved and nurtured in every aspect. The teachers here go above and beyond, and I can feel their enthusiasm towards the children's development. We're so blessed to have found a gem of a school which feels more like a cosy kampung! The outdoors right at their doorstep and the teachers' love for gardening really help my kids have a greater appreciation for nature too.

"Little Seeds Preschool (Capstone)","5","Fantastic preschool! The principal, teachers and staffs of the school always goes the extra mile for the kids. Both my kids were practically raised up in this school. Even though my older boy is already in P3, he would often reminisce how loving his preschool teachers were. Thankfully one of his teachers happened to be my younger daughter’s teacher as well!

The daily food for the kids are lovingly “home-cooked”  by uncle Tan!

The principal, teachers (even from other student classes) and support staff know each child by name and they genuinely care for the students.

"Little Seeds Preschool (Capstone)","5","It has been about 3.5 years since we started journeying with the teachers at Little Seeds Preschool (LSP) Capstone on the care and growth for 2 of our children (7 and 5 years old). The older child has graduated to Primary school but still has many fond memories of his time back at Little Seeds. His time at LSP Capstone provided a good foundation and smooth transition to Primary School.

Currently, our younger child looks forward to school everyday! She loves Praise and Worship, pastoral time, outdoors and music lessons. She also enjoyed the Project Work process where the teachers and children embarked on many STEAM activities to learn about the topic of Water and went on an excursion to the NEWater Visitor Centre!

I really appreciate that my children are in good hands each day with teachers who love and care for them deeply and they effectively communicate through regular updates. From my conversations with my children, I understand that teaching does not happen only through a one-way instruction but through play and facilitated discussions to help the children question and discover truths for themselves. In terms of curriculum, I love the Key to Learning Syllabus and the way phonics is systematically taught.

More importantly, values like gratitude, self-control, appreciation are taught and modeled in school. I see how my children are thriving in LSP Capstone and would definitely recommend this place!","2022-10-13T10:47:09.586Z","0","Cheryl Chen","7","false","2022-10-19T05:39:54.000Z","Thank you, Cheryl, for taking the time to leave us this feedback.

"School of Science and Technology, Singapore","3","This school gives visitors the feeling of a stifling shell—functional, but missing the heartbeat of a caring culture, shared identity, and sense of belonging. A soulful school feels like a home, not a well-equipped hotel: its walls, corridors and notice boards radiate kindness, creativity, and connection—through student art, heartfelt reminders, photos of CCAs, community projects and signs that reflect who they are and what they value. These visible cues matter deeply, especially during the teenage years, when holistic development depends not just on academics, but on feeling seen, safe, inspired, and encouraged to care for others. I was a bit surprised to see nothing of these which are commonly observed in many other schools in Singapore.","2025-08-16T08:10:33.436Z","0","SC Tan","13","false",,,"en","a week ago",,"Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25OV1pVaGFVRXBYZWxSc1VuWlhRVmszU1ZKVU5GRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sCi9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25OV1pVaGFVRXBYZWxSc1VuWlhRVmszU1ZKVU5GRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x85bf7beda6328e50!3m1!1s2@1:CAIQACodChtycF9oOnNWZUhaUEpXelRsUnZXQVk3SVJUNFE%7C0cc2ntP-J7w%7C?hl=en","114280931140906006810","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIxY75SZM9W6GpKlr5yysTUpFO3GBESyqX0PbwVPeAhOgOQYg=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114280931140906006810?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Suggestions for new dsa test : check their responsibility. Send a teacher to their primary school and watch them. This allows the teacher to assess the student, and they will know if they're a suitable candidate.
Teachers also needs to take matters in their own hands if a student reports a student for not doing their pt.

My eldest graduated from the centre with a strong foundation in both learning and social skills, and now my younger son is currently in N2 and enjoying his time there just as much.

The educators are nurturing, patient, and committed to each child’s development. They provide regular updates and maintain open communication, which gives me great peace of mind. The learning environment is warm and engaging, with a good balance of structure and play.

Thank you to the amazing team at Carpe Diem @ Spottiswoode for creating such a safe and supportive space for my boys to grow.

After moving, we pulled her out to attend a school near our current place during my maternity leave for 2nd child, however, there was a stark difference in her feedback when she came home everyday. Hence, she went right back to Carpe Diem Springs 4-5 months after and now her brother attends there too….despite the distance we have to travel everyday. That’s a testament in itself to how much the children likes the school and how we’re assured as parents the good education and wonderful care they get here.

"International Community School (Singapore)","5","We are so thankful for our time at ICS. It has been such a blessing to be part of a school that is truly rooted in Christian values. The education my kid received was not only academically solid but also grounded in faith, character, and love for others.

What stood out most to us was the dedication of the teachers and staff. They pour their hearts into the students, and that heart of service has made a lasting impression on our family. The ICS community is small, warm, and close-knit, and my kids made wonderful friendships that we know will stay with them for a life time. We are especially grateful for the wonderful Parent Teacher Fellowship and the Moms in Prayer team, who faithfully support the school and community with love, encouragement, and prayer. Their presence is a beautiful reflection of the Christ-centered spirit that makes ICS feel like a second home.

Highly recommend this school to any family looking for strong academics, caring community, and a Christ-centered education.","2025-05-27T01:42:54.309Z","0","Grace Ding","2","false",,,"en","3 months ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VMX3BsN2ZON3Jmc1RnEAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VMX3BsN2ZON3Jmc1RnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x3a7c62c6b06e7c53!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEL_pl7fN7rfsTg%7CCgwInrHUwQYQyOfkkwE%7C?hl=en","114491576356252495407","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXdRLHziGllfCdce_jXXPgZIE2_eNRqHGk2labt6EZr76XCx74=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114491576356252495407?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"International Community School (Singapore)","5","I am thrilled to share my positive experience with ICS School, where my child has been a student for the past two years. The school's commitment to biblical teachings is truly praiseworthy. Students actively engage in Bible memorization, prayer, and weekly worship, fostering a profound connection with God from an early age.

The teachers at ICS School deserve special commendation. Their warmth and patience stand out, empowering students to build confidence and cultivate politeness. The well-maintained teacher-to-student ratio ensures personalized attention, contributing to a nurturing learning environment.

Beyond academics, I appreciate the school's efforts in organizing various engaging activities that strengthen the connection between parents, teachers, and students. These initiatives create a vibrant community and enhance the overall educational experience.

In summary, I am grateful for the positive impact ICS School has had on my child's spiritual and academic growth. The dedication to character development, coupled with a supportive community, makes ICS School an exceptional choice for families seeking a well-rounded education.","2023-12-31T05:35:25.859Z","0","Christine Xu","3","false",,,"en","a year ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxNGVHZ1R3EAE","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90BU3Br5Zeh5AFi61jnwZqT1UbRU8vEcrhMepUjMzmgCums02IfvRmu5lDc27rdj86ECz30PyZg-I5HV5IVZ4j0QQFr86Ek6-Ykf7LxyY5-PS0bMPvypfgGI76WDdqgPn9e2GZD-3A","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90AkA2xgUZWnp0_CpPm9KgI69xLgCsj0_r-nubbnbG8llVN8xOb5GM_E4ibw0-iTF1zhIzUC6n4B5LD1IgCy8-kUv4kS-A4bOr-W9qlF4cnO8dnGQU8IATY7wo-Cw3IQvzB-OeZL","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90AokulUKSoNuGv8ulbU9zO1S4NcuKcyXTIWlc19IE8OHkLnoPP1m8sXcHLa0__h2nFc8sPBMqYbUbRG7QLj0MrlJyUJiqJRLlpp3AIY1o1tFS9r3ldbJYJcfy5P3VENigj6K0lI","Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxNGVHZ1R3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x3a7c62c6b06e7c53!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIC14eGgTw%7CCgwInfvDrAYQsInimQM%7C?hl=en","109862088996653464668","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVjAwapkdWXTtMm5ZhkeM4RSNAKyfTadFsH22vbHgNwHeLdkYky=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109862088996653464668?hl=en",,,,"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90A-miRpfyptwjladarYBA-f3_jkgr6IA1RWok5ZLeHz6bQmrLyF_9YaJSyGog6Dt0ehSxX7QjLdtFlG_H4VhcIUPbaekWOSc3KDkj8U-kFYyu9QgJbUGZaUEJ0Ak7ToE7EBYgQ0",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"International Community School (Singapore)","5","ICS is a small community school where everyone knows and addresses each other by their names! Everyday as one drives into the school, you are greeted with warm and cheery staff, especially one of its directors, Ms Sarah Goh. It is a happy school. More importantly, the values of integrity and compassion are well embeded into the teacher-staff-student daily learning and communication. We appreciate ICS for giving my child the opportunity to choose and grow in his areas of interest. In his Senior thesis, he was allowed to choose a topic of interest, that is, increasing the social virality of his Youtube channel. In the course of this, he was able to develop his research and communications skills. Second, ICS has sufficient module offerings to allow my child to grow his giftings. For example, being part of the School Yearbook team, he was able to hone his photography and editing skills. As a result, he was able to intern, upon graduation, at a photo studio. This has led to an opportunity to help out in documenting and producing 20 individualised photobooks for persons living with dementia and the Senior Centre's staff and volunteers. We thank God for raising up teachers and staff who live out their authentic Christian faith in ICS.","2023-12-04T10:07:35.713Z","0","Patricia Lee","12","false",,,"en","Edited a year ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURGbmJPemx3RRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURGbmJPemx3RRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x3a7c62c6b06e7c53!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDFnbOzlwE%7CCgwI58m2qwYQ0Pmc1AI%7C?hl=en","100728941050345098976","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLelYwxEcSBKer5HzSafYUIQApPjbtEO6zskfqk9yxB8I9H8g=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100728941050345098976?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"International Community School (Singapore)","5","The number one thing we will miss when we leave Singapore is ICS. ICS is a caring community where students receive wholistic education that allow them to excel academically as well as grow emotionally and spiritually. Without question, ICS is a very nurturing environment where every student feels loved and valued, as God’s masterpiece! The school is led by exceptional administrators and gifted teachers who are genuinely called to educate minds, transform lives, and impact the world for the glory of God. We are forever grateful for how the school has blessed my two children these past eight years. Through the careful mentoring and modelling of the teachers, our two kids have not only excelled academically, but more importantly, their character and values have been shaped beautifully. Thank you ICS for helping our kids build such a solid and godly foundation for life.

"International Community School (Singapore)","5","To be honest, ICS was not on our radar when we began searching for schools in SG for our two elementary aged daughters. We are SO grateful that we happened upon it on Google! Our girls had been at a large, well-known school in China and despite all of the bells and whistles - stunning new campus and an amazing array of programs - they were doing ok but weren’t thriving in the way we’d hoped. After meeting with ICS admissions and feeling the warmth and care even in those early conversations, we were confident this was the right school for our girls. The entire staff see their work as more than a job and more of a calling - they are passionate educators who are truly shaping and encouraging our children to be little world changers. The caring community, intentionality in character building, and individual attention are beyond compare. We didn’t know how our family would adjust to SG, but largely due to ICS, we are loving it, feel connected, and hope to stay long term! ☺️","2023-04-25T08:13:33.709Z","0","Kari Ann Tilson","3","false","2023-04-25T05:58:46.000Z","Thank you so much for sharing your experience with ICS.

Subjects are taught by different subject teachers in specific classrooms with the required materials and equipment. The school also has a good sized playground with trampoline and a mini stage for the children’s mid year mini showcase.

Despite that difficult time for the kid and for us as parents, the teachers are very supportive and caring towards our son. They would update us regularly and answer whatever questions we have to ensure we're not worrying too much.
Shoutout to chenqin laoshi and tch veron, our son's form teacher and assistant teacher, they are one of the reasons i am sure we have chosen the right school for our son. Ms fatin, the principal, also very caring and explain things in a friendly manner, easy to understand.
Posso has good responses and action plans towards disease outbreak that may sometimes happen at school, ensuring the students are always taken care of. They are pretty strict in terms of not allowing sick kids coming to school as well, so it is quite reassuring for other students.
So many to say but anyways we're happy these past year having our son learn and play there! Keep it up posso tampines, so proud of all the teachers!","2024-12-18T02:17:36.049Z","0","Stella Tan","17","true","2025-01-05T09:51:31.000Z","

Putting on clothes, doing simple Maths, write English letters, greeting others, drawing pictures, confidently giving speeches in front of class, doing performances, enjoying cooking, and much more. All these he learnt at Posso preschool. Posso focuses on cultivating children in all aspects. More importantly, Posso promotes children's interests in learning and respects their rhythm of learning.

The hurt was deep to bone and the scar will be permanent . The school admitted that my daughter was tripped over by a teacher in the class room and bumped to a hard angle of the chair. This incident happened in May. Up to now, no apology has been given. The school regard it as an accident hardly to avoid. No compensation has been given by the school to cover any of the 15thousand medical cost. And the school is trying to sue a heart-broken mother for posting this incident on social media. And they regard this as “ a deformation of reputation” . No comment but to tell the fact.

"Brighton Montessori River Valley (Crystal Court)","2","Was fine until we got a new Form Teacher for K2, who could not speak or write proper English (eg mixing up gender, and singular vs plural terms), and made frequent marking mistakes in both Eng and Math.  Felt she was hardworking and caring though, and perhaps could make a good Mandarin teacher.  But, learnt later that inappropriate remarks were made to the children, that could terrify or scare them (about throwing them out, etc)..
Seriously inadequate carpark facilities, esp after merger with GreatWorld branch. Imagine total of more than 100 children, in a facility with only 8 outdoor lots (no shelter), out of which, 6 lots are located dangerously close to the canal, and laden with uneven or broken concrete slabs and stones all around (my child fell at a lot and got injured once).
Despite numerous reminders not to throw anything, they still lost some of my child's work and craft done at school (6 out of 8 items I tried to get, were lost, guess thrown away) :(
Overall, not worth the high fees, as even the government or government-related centres had teachers who spoke and taught better Eng, and who displayed more sincerity.  Here, no viable action was done to rectify the issue of the lack of Eng standards in a kindergarten level teacher who taught Eng and Math, and not a single word of apology was given to address the fact that changing school in the middle of the final yr of kindergarten posed so much hassle to us.","2020-06-09T06:37:39.650Z","0","BY BY","1","false",,,"en","5 years ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjeHQyZ1BnEAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjeHQyZ1BnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xc5ba05dac39098f!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDcxt2gPg%7CCgwIs9z89gUQ8O6HtgI%7C?hl=en","102231486183875729241","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJvmV4ci5m_VA0tGlkFsU5M3UosqN5BeFa073DG7MULkZjT1w=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102231486183875729241?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Simon Eio Learning Centre - Primary, Secondary and JC Math & Science Tuition @ Clementi","5","5 stars! Mr Eio was a great teacher. To be honest at first I really disliked the lessons and couldn't understand much. But Mr Eio was helpful and helped me to understand the things that I couldn't understand. I must say that you have to take charge of your own learning and go up to him with questions. Don't wait silently without understanding anything, which is what I was like in the first half of my lessons with him. He was willing to stay back with me when I had questions and encouraged me alot

I was a F9 student throughout sec 3. Got D7 for my prelims. For my Olevels I got an A2. I must say Mr Eio is not some kind of a magician to help you instantly change your grades. You have to put in the hard work yourself. But he certainly was a very big help and helped me to achieve my results. His encouragement meant so much each night and it gave me the motivation and drive to make him and myself proud. He helped me understand the concepts better for every question I asked

100% recommend. I would have expected to get an A for my Amath. Was even considering dropping it. Mr Eio can be strict sometimes, but his lessons are engaging and fun. You will definitely enjoy it. Thank you Mr Eio for being so patient and encouraging and for making the difference!","2024-03-05T11:40:59.989Z","0","Ethnan","3","false",,,"en","a year ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5dHNUY3R3RRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5dHNUY3R3RRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x9de53a82ffc4dee9!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIC9tsTctwE%7CCgwIy4mcrwYQ4MLg1wM%7C?hl=en","111134550970762394892","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUUdg9PvsNxpch5monnXUwo6thJiviIZVHsbeaE4K84kpkDWytmfg=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111134550970762394892?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mr Eio is very passionate about Mathematics, and constantly encourages his students to work hard and tackle & approach the problems in the simplest way possible.
I have been consistently scoring A grades for math, A for PSLE, A1 and A2 in O levels for EMath and AMath respectively and soon I believe, A for A levels too.

"Simon Eio Learning Centre - Primary, Secondary and JC Math & Science Tuition @ Clementi","5","The centre as well as its teachers have accompanied me throughout my secondary school years. Their close guidance and teaching methods are one of the main reasons why I am able to understand and grasp concepts much quicker than my peers in school which facilitates a deeper understanding of the topic and subject as a whole. The teachers are very open and dedicated to helping my classmates and I whenever and wherever we may have had problems with our work, making the learning process much smoother and less frustrating than it would have been without them. It is thanks to them that I am confident in scoring well in my O levels.

Mr Eio has each lesson curated by him to provide the fastest path to understanding the topic in both E math and A math, distilling the learning points of the topic at hand through his years of experience teaching and allowing us to learn it deeply before tackling harder questions. It allows students like myself to have a good perspective on what the topic actually is without getting scared by the more difficult problems that the topic may have to offer, allowing me to score more marks during the exam as I am able to rely on the few important question processing steps that he has emphasised during lessons.

Mr Lim makes learning easier by giving many real life examples and applications of the sciences that we are learning in class, making information stick and making it easier for me to retrieve information during exams. He plans his lessons meticulously and has a plan for each stage of learning that we are in, whether it be in studying or revision. He goes the extra mile by sorting through years and years of past year papers from other schools and picking out the most interesting ones so that we are better equipped to answer whatever questions come out for the exams; which can be quite erratic as is the nature of the science exams, which is why his extensive combing is much appreciated

It has been a joy to be the student of the amazing teachers here and their continuous help throughout the years truly allowed me to perform my utmost best during the exams. I cannot recommend this place enough.","2023-12-31T08:17:19.983Z","0","Lim Cheng khai","1","false",,,"en","a year ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxa2JpVnB3RRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxa2JpVnB3RRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x9de53a82ffc4dee9!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIC1kbiVpwE%7CCgwIj8fErAYQwOf81AM%7C?hl=en","108833275355462328770","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU54Ilq50xSl1fbSyglvfbcc3VheF9LMQfGnLtKJh-efd0V1NA=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108833275355462328770?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As Mr Eio uses humour to teach, it really allowed me to learn in a fun way. After teaching a new concept, he would let us try a few questions on it and then will personally come to our desks to mark. He will then explain the concept thoroughly again to those who still do not get it.","2023-11-23T05:04:36.128Z","0","Ustreetboi 02","2","false",,,"en","a year ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsNWVxNnB3RRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsNWVxNnB3RRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x9de53a82ffc4dee9!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICl5eq6pwE%7CCgsI5Lr7qgYQsJKOPQ%7C?hl=en","105706090019116137025","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUQ1YT82lIGMeszoBWvxzAma0StgDjjYdxsrMly53eA-llxEK49=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105706090019116137025?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After class, we engage in musical exploration where we take a look at other pieces outside the syllabus, and she is more than happy to play them for me.

"Masterminds Montessori Kindergarten","5","We cannot express enough gratitude for the incredible experience our three children have had at Masterminds Namly. This school has not only become their second home but has masterfully prepared them for their academic future in ways that continue to amaze us.

The academic foundation our children have built at Masterminds Namly is truly remarkable. The school's approach to preparing students for future educational success goes far beyond traditional kindergarten curriculum. Their bilingual program has given our children fluency in both English and Chinese, providing them with invaluable language skills that will open doors throughout their academic careers and beyond.

What sets this school apart is how seamlessly they blend rigorous academic preparation with the caring, loving environment that makes learning joyful. The teachers are not just dedicated educators—they are visionary professionals who understand how to build critical thinking skills, foster independence, and instill a genuine love of learning that will serve our children for life.

The multicultural environment enriches their academic experience immensely, exposing them to diverse perspectives and ways of thinking that broaden their intellectual horizons. Our children's confidence has grown exponentially, not just socially but academically—they approach new challenges with enthusiasm and the tools to succeed.

Masterminds brilliantly prepares children for future academic success by developing self-direction, problem-solving abilities, and intrinsic motivation. Our children have learned to think independently, manage their time effectively, and take ownership of their learning—skills that will be invaluable as they progress through their educational journey.

The thoughtfully designed quaterly field activities reinforce classroom learning while developing real-world application skills. These experiences teach our children to connect academic concepts to the world around them, fostering the kind of critical thinking that top schools look for.

Under the leadership of their incredibly principal, Carol, the school maintains academic excellence while nurturing the whole child. The curriculum is rigorous yet age-appropriate, challenging our children to reach their full potential while building the strong academic foundation they need for future success.

We owe this school and its remarkable teachers so much. They've given our children the academic tools, confidence, and love of learning that will carry them through elementary school, high school, and beyond. When we see how well-prepared and excited about learning our children are, we know Masterminds Namly has given them the greatest gift possible—a strong start for lifelong academic success.

To any parent seeking academic excellence combined with genuine care: Masterminds Namly delivers preparation for the future while making the present joyful. Our three children are not just ready for their next academic steps—they're thriving.","2025-08-13T05:19:50.464Z","0","Jessie Dourcy","6","false",,,"en","2 weeks ago",,"Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25saFYwUmZWM2g2Y1MwM1RHTXRkbTVvY0dKcU5WRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sCi9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25saFYwUmZWM2g2Y1MwM1RHTXRkbTVvY0dKcU5WRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xf35e4cc6d5a71e28!3m1!1s2@1:CAIQACodChtycF9oOnlhV0RfV3h6cS03TGMtdm5ocGJqNVE%7C0cb10qQe9Yi%7C?hl=en-GB","101041607993695358917","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK7S4LAkw47mSIqPBtKkLcmvhE_p_YyZwgfcBDwBUY5-r6K8w=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101041607993695358917?hl=en-GB",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Modern Montessori Bukit Batok - MMI","1","Very belated review.. If I can rate them zero, i totally will. My child was transferred here from another MMI during Covid,unfortunately rhat few months was the worst time of my child's pre-school life and for us too.
Firstly, principal n teachers didn't follow Covid rules of masking up. When asked, they gave ALOT of excuse n were very defensive.
Principal was obviously showing bias towards my child when we complained and she gave a super bad attitude to us and the child. What kind of educator does that!? We spoke to a few parents and they were also not happy with them (for their own reasons) but they decided not to pursue since their child has just a few months to graduation. Same for us, but it was too hard to bear.

Not going through long story here but since there were some issues with the principal, we went down to talk to her. she  spoke to us from inside the center, through the window. After while, said the kids were sleeping so she stepped out to talk but started shouting soon after n then stormed back into the center n slammed the door on us and left us standing outside the school! Seriously?? The principal?? Why did she do that? Because she couldn't defend her own mistakes anymore n decided to hide away?

We even spoke to head office and when we thought head office is making some actions, all they said was, the principal had been with them for many years.
So what does that even mean?? They said will speak to her but nothing came back to ua. Honestly, we were so upset that we even contemplated to go to ECDA but decided not to in case it affects my child.
Despite us not not bringing this further, the principal & some teachers showed prejudice towards my child. It's obvious in many little ways.

And I finally decided to review them after so many years, is because my child only recently asked me why did she change to Bt Batok & said she hated the school. The principal n a teacher would look at her and frown at her for no reason. The teacher even asked my child why is she frowning at the teacher?
Again, seriously??? Why would a child frown at the adult, if maybe in the first place, the adult frowned at the child??

If the principal or teachers have an issue with the parents, or they are not happy with the parents making comments or complains about their double standards, then please speak to us. They SHOULD NOT do that to a child, AS AN EDUCATOR. In the first place, if they had done right and not done double standards, there wouldn't be any issues for anyone. They are not even handling rhe situation as a professional.

In short, that short few months of school change was a TOTAL MISTAKE and it has totally ruined a small child's preschool life. In fact, it has ruined ours and our view of MMI too.

If any parents like to know the story, I'm happy to speak to you.
It's just too much to type here.","2024-09-24T13:51:32.048Z","0","Christine E","10","false",,,"en","11 months ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNuMHZLNGZREAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNuMHZLNGZREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xfc073273b57f7fc!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICn0vK4fQ%7CCgsI5IfLtwYQuJKQFw%7C?hl=en","100098041772942447828","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocI8mvQnLLCL-sDjvPSu-zFKWzphWsTk9bX3fW3fmFkMfVaMIQ=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100098041772942447828?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Teachers are dedicated and passionate.

"Modern Montessori Bukit Batok - MMI","5","My son has been with the school for 4 years now and we’ve been really happy with this school. We had the privilege of experiencing 2 principals and both have been super hands on, which is important to us as they walk the talk. In the morning and evening, principal Ms Ima is there to greet and send off the children. It is also easy to communicate with her and to review my child’s growth thanks to her presence at the center.

Teachers here are thoughtful and sincere in their care and teaching of the children. They have the child’s development at heart and this is hard to find as I believe most teachers are hit with a fatigue given the general shortage of teachers now.

For example, even during school trips, Ms Deborah goes above and beyond to prepare for any mishaps (e.g. preparing extra uniforms for the children), which I really appreciate after a child (mine) went wild to play in the rain.

I’m not sure about other methodologies but the Montessori method has greatly taught my son independence in his conduct at home and I’m super grateful for that. Can’t wait to send my daughter to MMI Bukit Batok when she turn 18 months old!","2024-01-25T13:44:18.686Z","0","Sheevonne","37","true",,,"en","a year ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURObzh6SnlnRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURObzh6SnlnRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xfc073273b57f7fc!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDNo8zJygE%7CCgwIssvJrQYQ8LO7xwI%7C?hl=en","117823702801835257734","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjULIw9zAszwAWZptLf-DRNWIm2qMyEUs7aULBMVqdu-fvOXD6SZ7w=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117823702801835257734?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Being overwhelmed by the new environment, the first few weeks were tough for my daughter and drop-offs were tearful. The Brighton team was understanding and let her hold onto her bunny plushie during those early days, offering her the comfort she needed. One teacher, in particular, quickly earned her trust—a big milestone for our daughter, who doesn’t warm up easily.

Now, we’re beginning to see her grow in confidence and independence. She’s becoming more curious, trying new things on her own, and often talks about school and her teachers positively at home.

Communication with the team has been excellent, including comprehensive weekly updates, regular photo sharing through their app, parent-teacher meetings, and quick and helpful responses to our queries.

The curriculum weaves together structured learning and play-based activities, staying true to Montessori principles while incorporating creative and engaging elements. Educational experiences are thoughtfully planned and tailored to each child’s developmental stage.

The teachers' dedication is evident in the effort they put into creating engaging activities, which we can see through frequent app updates. Their commitment to documenting our children's learning journey helps us feel connected to their daily experiences.

Many thanks to his teachers and helpers in school taking wonderful care of him and keeping us updated with photos. Not to forget the chef who cooks him healthy and yummy meals, which Caius loves (he will come home telling me how delicious it was).

Caius has been exposed to self-directed activity, hands-on learning and collaborative play.
Special thanks to Ms Siti, Ms Sharon, Fang lao shi, Ms Sze Ing, Ms Dinah, Ms Farah and Principal Shirleen for your patience and unconditional care. Trust me Caius remembers the stories and songs you all read and sang to him. Thank you for making school enjoyable for him.

Thank you Brighton Montessori @ Hillview!","2024-11-04T09:53:37.717Z","0","YuJie Yeo","2","false",,,"en","9 months ago",,"ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzMHJzRxAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzMHJzRxAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x1d07d134d2251b15!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIC30rsG%7CCgwIobOiuQYQyL7z1QI%7C?hl=en","100246233727222452486","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKjYAVro17I7vZxwOAGWwoiXfzk2YfEPzNRyAFQHPkvrgGasg=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100246233727222452486?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Like other acquisition and thereafter transition is difficult for everyone, however, the teachers made it easier not only for the kids but to parents. The teachers patience is acknowledged, from a non Montessori setting, they created a new and friendly Montessori environment for the kids. 👍
From a non schooler, I thank the teachers at Brighton for educating my kid to adapt primary school easily.

Like every other kinder school, each have their own problems to solve (I.e staffing). At Brighton, staffing has always promptly taken and no impact to anyone. But no fret, their environment and curriculum are well designed to comfort, kid friendly as well as education.

The kids are induce with knowledge ready for primary school but also playing is part of their learning. Many additional enrichment provided like sports, dancing and robotics.

I would recommend Brighton Hillview but hey parents go take a look at the centre yourself after all your kid has to like it.","2024-10-19T00:08:09.882Z","0","Min Loong","8","false",,,"en","10 months ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYMWVTMXN3RRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYMWVTMXN3RRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x1d07d134d2251b15!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICX1eS1swE%7CCgwI6fDLuAYQwNDtpAM%7C?hl=en","103273289585489725857","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLd7awFcYj18PuqTIbirhZMzxdRPk6oB_MGVb4yEehE6wmYEMQ=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103273289585489725857?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Nurtured Nest","5","Nurtured Nest holds a very special place in our hearts. My daughter spent nearly three years there, and those years laid a truly beautiful foundation for her—socially, emotionally, and intellectually. She made friends for life and experienced a nurturing environment that continues to shape her even after our move to Canada.

What impressed me most was how seamlessly the teachers at Nurtured Nest instilled a sense of discipline and individuality from such a young age. For young girls in particular, it’s so important to learn that their voices matter and their opinions are valued—and this was deeply embedded in the school's ethos. Remarkably, the confidence and curiosity my daughter developed at Nurtured Nest helped her transition smoothly to her new school, where she continues to thrive.

Beyond the children’s growth, the school embodies the multicultural spirit of Singapore. Every festival—whether Chinese New Year, Hari Raya, or Diwali—is celebrated with equal joy and inclusiveness. As parents, we were welcomed as part of a larger extended family, and I still fondly remember looking forward to each of these celebrations.

Choosing Nurtured Nest was one of the best decisions we made for our daughter. I would be more than happy to connect with any prospective parent who would like to hear more about our experience.","2025-06-30T17:00:10.947Z","0","R S","4","false",,,"en","a month ago",,"Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xWamMxRmxMVFIxVjNScFdWVTFlR0ZxUzNBd2IzYxAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sCi9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xWamMxRmxMVFIxVjNScFdWVTFlR0ZxUzNBd2IzYxAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x4d9f85eb69e62e8e!3m1!1s2@1:CAIQACodChtycF9oOlVjc1FlLTR1V3RpWVU1eGFqS3Awb3c%7C0cNg9PsTFk6%7C?hl=en","117103322254160111698","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWH55zBKkh1aUr3yhOSWd08oiykANGLOuAsTOvgHiMIz0XMIYEc=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117103322254160111698?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Nurtured Nest","5","Our two young boys attended Nurtured Nest from around 17–18 months old and spent several wonderful years there. We initially chose NN because of its focus on outdoor play, child independence, and its warm, community feel—and it delivered on all fronts.

One of the selling points for us for us was the small class sizes. Our boys were in groups of just 6–12 children, not in a room of 30. This made a huge difference in the level of care and attention they received. Every morning began with outdoor play—rain or shine. On rainy days, the kids were bundled up in raincoats and boots, and we absolutely loved this commitment to outdoor time and resilience.

The small size of the school means the staff can really tailor care to each child. Toilet training, for example, was handled with patience and support. All staff knew the children and families well, which created a strong sense of connection and made for a gentle, nurturing transition into school life.

Healthy, varied meals are provided, and the children are introduced to cooking activities from as young as 18 months, which they loved. Forest school is also introduced to the kids around 4.

As a relatively new school, Nurtured Nest had a few teething issues in its early years—mainly around communication and some staff turnover—but to their credit, these were acknowledged and addressed. So please read old reviews with compassion, building a school is no easy feat! The team clearly puts a lot of thought into ensuring staff align with the school’s ethos, which takes time and required hard choices but pays off.

Our children were very happy there, and we were genuinely sad to leave when we relocated. Nurtured Nest gave them a beautiful, nurturing start to their educational journey, and we’re incredibly grateful for that.","2025-06-06T00:22:05.912Z","0","Jade Dyson","9","false","2025-06-25T12:48:54.000Z","Thank you so much for your incredibly thoughtful review — it truly means a lot to us.

This school first caught our attention with its thoughtfully decorated, homely environment and its teaching methods, and throughout her time there, it did not disappoint. You could see a great deal of creative effort going into the thought and preparation of the unique daily activities and regular special events.

"Nurtured Nest","5","I was most fortunate to do my practicum placement at Nurtured Nest Preschool for 1 month in the capacity of a teacher-in-training while I was pursuing my diploma in Early Childhood Care and Education. The team of teachers are passionate for the children’s learning, social emotional well-being, and most importantly— FUN! The activities organised for the children are catered to their interests and needs, and are very much authentic learning experiences which engage the children’s 5 senses, and gives them plenty of opportunities to play and work with one another in the great outdoors. It is not your typical preschool where children are forced to sit down and listen to a static, academic lesson from a whiteboard, but instead a play-based school where they are fully immersed and engaged in their learning. Children spend lots of time getting messy and dirty in the sand and rain (with raincoats and boots of course!), creating masterful artworks with paint and loose parts and glue, or simply just having a picnic in the grass patch behind the school. This is not just a great school for young children, but for any potential practicum students who are looking for a unique, vibrant, and out-of-the-norm preschool as an attachment centre. Cheers to Sheena and the team for their hospitality, care, and professionalism as they accommodated me for the 1 month I was attached there. I’ve surely learned many valuable skills as an aspiring educator, and brought back several fond memories in my short stint there.","2023-08-28T08:50:57.167Z","0","Douglas","19","true",,,"en","2 years ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwNDRTb1lBEAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwNDRTb1lBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x4d9f85eb69e62e8e!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDp44SoYA%7CCgsI8b-xpwYQsIzXTw%7C?hl=en","108498843419472815199","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWJLyTDn4CQokgUhF-Ahc7mDyNXZD2dmpqUe2vJENKjItE2CkaDfw=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108498843419472815199?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The school really strives to create the best possible learning environment for the children, by continuously innovating, never getting complacent and always bringing new ideas and projects to life.
During her time at NN, our daughter has been exposed to a multitude of activities (mandarin, music class, ballet, musical show, art and craft, forest school and more) and has been continuously stimulated and engaged in new endeavours.
The management team as well as team of educators have always been very approachable and always very responsive and sensitive to every single query or concern we had.

"Nurtured Nest","4","Our child attended Nurtured Nest for more than a year. I would give it a 4.5/5, and since there is no half star I’m putting a 4/5 here in Google Maps.

The good: Although the school itself is small, it has a beautiful backyard with a garden, pond, sand play, etc. where the kids can enjoy themselves during outdoor time. We value outdoor time for our child and NN provides lots of this during the day, sometimes even when it rains (the children are required to have raincoats and boots). We also resonate with the Reggio Emilia approach which the school follows.

The reason for half star: The school is relatively new, and still faces some challenges operationally, like turnover of teachers. However, I want to emphasise that through the challenges they faced, they never failed to provide loving care for the children.

Overall we are happy with the experience NN provided our child.","2023-07-03T02:38:13.096Z","0","Jeffrey L.","126","true",,,"en","2 years ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKbmQ2VmVREAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKbmQ2VmVREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x4d9f85eb69e62e8e!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICJnd6VeQ%7CCgsIlemIpQYQqOyQLg%7C?hl=en","107882675981346741251","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVamOz2iFrnepfAkl3QmoVjMmDuK-sPRt_jHRn8yyMWzP7gsOUn=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107882675981346741251?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Nurtured Nest","5","I cannot say enough positive things about Sheena and school that my son attended. From the first day of school, it was clear that Sheena and her team was dedicated and passionate about their works. They went above and beyond to create a welcoming and inclusive classroom environment where every student felt valued and respected.

Throughout the year, Sheena and her team consistently demonstrated a deep understanding of subject matters and a commitment to ensuring that each student was able to reach their full potential. They were patient, encouraging, and always willing to go the extra mile to help their students succeed. My son often came home excited to share what they had learned in class that day, and it was clear that the teacher had instilled a love of learning in them.

In addition to Sheena's dedication, the school as a whole showed a commitment to excellence and innovation.

Overall, I would highly recommend this school to any parent looking for a nurturing, engaging, and loving environment for their child. The dedication and passion that Sheena and school showed throughout the year were truly inspiring, and I am grateful for the positive impact they had on my child's education.

Keep up the great works Sheena and team!","2023-05-04T13:36:06.671Z","0","Wendy Yong","4","false",,,"en","2 years ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMjVMTGlRRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMjVMTGlRRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x4d9f85eb69e62e8e!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDR25LLiQE%7CCgwIxunOogYQqMaowAI%7C?hl=en","114021454666651721826","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKPdB6hRPe7olIPcCbobQHlRK-0AZhrO0gf4-uKvFn_9vv59GuU=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114021454666651721826?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"My First Skool at Blk 260 Bukit Batok","5","Enrolled my 2yo (playgroup) this year and this may be one of the best decision we have made for the year (: Credits goes to all her teachers (Ms Kavitha, Lulu laoshi, Ms Wahidah and Xu Laoshi) who have been guiding her patiently and showering all the little ones with love..

Teacher Kavitha/Lulu laoshi will always take the effort to summarise and share how was my girl's day in school whenever my mom picks her up (as my mom will always ask ""how is she today"") this is something we really appreciate as we parents will want to know the progress of our child. As i understand from my peers that some other schools/teachers may not do this since it is not ""mandatory"" and they will just ask parents to refer to the daily/monthly update in the app etc. Thus, it makes us even more assured that we chose the right place for our little one.

"My First Skool at Blk 260 Bukit Batok","5","This childcare centre by MFS is a hidden gem. My elder boy entered the centre halfway in K1 (in 2019) and the teachers (Luo Laoshi & Teacher Ram) did a great job to assimilate him and encouraged the other children to engage him. For a boy who cried daily at drop off in his previous school, we were prepared that he'll cry again, but to our surprise, he didn't cry at all during this transition and thereafter, enjoyed going to sch daily until he graduated last year.

My younger child now has the same privilege to be cared for by the same team of dedicated teachers (Luo Laoshi, Teacher Ram & Teacher Kavitha).

Curriculum wise, I had my concerns initially like most parents - shd I pay more for better academic focus? That's always the scale that most parents would weigh, but my concerns were allayed as I've come to realize that MFS is a good balance of both affordability and quality. My elder boy enjoyed learning through the various inquiry projects - there would be different themes each term and the teachers put in a lot of effort to pique children's curiosity via hands-on activity, parent engagement,  relation to current affairs and relevance to primary school. The teachers also took many pictures of my child in action and I can easily view the pictures weekly in the parents portal to see what they've learned in school. My boy excelled under this system and is now doing well in primary school with strong foundation set during the 2 yrs of his time in MFS.

Apart from its team of caring and competent teachers, the centre's layout is also a plus point. The classes are split into 3 different bays around blk 258/260, so cases of hfmd, and even covid were kept to a minimal.

Many parents who sent their children to this centre also echo my same view and thus I'd not hesitate to recommend this centre to my family, neighbours and friends.","2022-04-29T00:40:14.571Z","0","Angie Lim","48","true",,,"en","3 years ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMydTlfcnh3RRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMydTlfcnh3RRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x50ffed8feee11f9b!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIC2u9_rxwE%7CCgwI7ueskwYQwImjkAI%7C?hl=en","116879454689861179089","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIf65D4t2JQ4EmBI0xTHrnlvBVAQ60Qe1f9qHA56rnwf3yl7A=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116879454689861179089?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Looking ahead to my return to Japan in a few years, I decided to enroll because I wanted the interactions between my friends to be primarily in Japanese, and the children who spoke to me in a friendly manner during the tour attracted me. Reasonable prices and no naps for younger children were also important.
After touring 7 schools, I decided on this school, and my impressions after actually attending it were, ``It's fun and there are so many events!''
I think the children are able to feel the seasons through experience rather than just learning about them on paper. There were many things that parents could participate in, and I made many new mom friends.
I can feel the love that the teachers have in the way they interact with the children, and I'm glad I chose this kindergarten.","en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And this school also values the independence of children.
My eldest son was shy and very particular, but the school never forced him to do things he didn't want to do, and the school staff seemed to encourage him casually, so he enjoyed going there until he graduated.
They also actively incorporate physical activity, and in addition to playing outside and using the play gym, children can also participate in soccer, baton treadmills, and ballet if they wish. My son participated in soccer, and apparently ran until he was drenched in sweat every time.
They not only hold events in Singapore, but also Japanese events, so there were a lot of events, and the children seemed to enjoy themselves.
I hope this school will continue to be a place where children can enjoy going.","en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Arts Junior Montessori Preschool","5","Hi
I'm writing this testimonial with lots of love and gratitude for all the support and great services that the Art Junior Montessori had provided for my daughter.Siti Aisyah had an impressive progress in her tenure at Arts Junior Montessori, both her teachers and Principal were very patient and never had failed to keep encourage Siti Aisyah to improve her motor skills and communication.

My Daughter, Siti Aisyah was delayed in her speech and her motorskills .Since that first interview with Ms Shana in which she provided Siti Aisyah the opportunity to enroll in Arts Junior Montessori,  little by little she has been able to control herself by crawling and learning to walk/stand . This was all possible due to the staff dedication and strong work ethics commitment .

Both myself and my husband really appreciate all the effort, hard work, love and care that every carer has ever shown towards her. Enrolling my daughter into Arts Junior Montessori was one of the best things we’ve done as a family.

I would highly recommend to anyone looking for child care in this area. 🤗","2021-06-04T10:49:54.175Z","0","Nurul Abdullah","1","false",,,"en","4 years ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxLXYzSy1nRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxLXYzSy1nRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x68ce408f72448162!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICq-v3K-gE%7CCgsI0orohQYQ8LvQUw%7C?hl=en","102230330219428344359","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVgTWnywurQDi7Yz-wbnuVact9Ii6646qi205HQ7rJO5PbPy4Pr=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102230330219428344359?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Arts Junior Montessori Preschool","1","I would like to recount my experience at the school and for all parents to be informed. My child was severely injured with a bone displacement and fracture and was not given first-aid. The school also did not inform me of the injury and she was crying for at least 45 minutes till I arrived to pick her. She was clutching her injured arm, sitting beside two teachers who were nonchalantly cutting paper and not paying any attention to her. She was later admitted to A&E and was there for 9 hours.

We then found out that they had hired an illegal worker who was supervising the children. Unfortunately, the School avoided all responsibility and refused to meet with us nor the parents of the two boys who caused the injury. The School's owner (Ms Momoyo Misugi) also prevented one of the boy's mother from apologizing to us as she said that my father threatened to beat the boys. When we confronted her on this matter, she panicked (wondering how we got to know about it) and brushed it away saying that she may have misheard my father.

With regards to the illegal employment, the School maintained that the person was an 'observer' and was not paid. Other parents and I saw the person for more than 3 weeks and actively working with the kids. Not just observing. The School then told ECDA that the person was there for only less than a week.

For close to 9 months, Ms Misugi refused to meet us till she finally relented to pressure from ECDA (government). Even to fix a date for the meeting, she kept saying she was not free or was overseas. On a day that she was supposed to be away, she was caught red-handed by ECDA to be in the School.

With the influx of students since Jan 2017, there's been much overcrowding, poor control and hygiene especially at the toilets. The teachers look irritated and harassed especially with the younger children crying non-stop and their diapers falling off because the teachers are just overwhelmed with the number of kids.

They also sent us reminders of late payment on school fees during the months that my daughter was recovering from her fractured and displaced arm. We found that to be in such poor taste. We also had a hard time enrolling her in a new school as they did not release her name from the childcare link system. The School also refused to return us our deposit.

I also heard from another parent about her son being bitten by mosquitoes/bugs so badly he came home with 12 very swollen and lumpy bites all over his legs and body. The parents asked the school and they simply replied that there were no other cases so the boy must have gotten it from elsewhere. The parent was very upset with the dismissive attitude. She pulled her child out.

In my 1+ year enrolling my child in the school, more than 4 local principals/administrators came and left. There was also high turnover of admin staff. I thought something was very wrong when teachers also started to leave all of a sudden. I know of at least 2 teaches who went on leave and never came back.

Back in 2016/17, the school did not take temperature and check for HFMD. I am not sure if that is allowed. We highlighted this to them several times and they made some attempt of getting parents to record the temperature before coming to school. I believe this is not in line with ECDA's requirement.

Hope to bring awareness to other parents out there.","2018-05-31T02:07:58.112Z","0","Reina Ng Sekiguchi","32","true",,,"en","Edited 7 years ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURROXZ2SXpBRRAB","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90DH_nITD-_Xq-NNDBA2kXxELn5bJ9EWB0wnUcKhfygL4exczk-eId5IEetJB86nh9ETZalJM2Em1q7io38on9AuZ7dABgFMgomdnwERGncVjq8EZnnxHwWQSIx5ZZru1xrROWsKAQ",,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURROXZ2SXpBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x68ce408f72448162!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDQ9vvIzAE%7CCgsI_rG92AUQgPizNQ%7C?hl=en","108301221486235948012","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV6YKVsP0QJY7VcmWVm81njq3xCIsKeFiOd7hfN7HORnCrbGknDoA=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108301221486235948012?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Arts Junior Montessori Preschool","1","In 2017, our 2 years old daughter started to go to Arts Junior Montessori. On 3rd day, when mother picked up our daughter, she was crying badly. Mother thouht it was just because our daughter didn't like the school so she left the school quickly. On their way home, mother found 3 injuries in arm (bleeding), knee and inside mouth (bleeding). We complained over phone but the school didn't admit nor apologize. On the contrary, they suspected she was injured after school and asked us the possibility of injury after school repeatedly even after we explained the possibility of 3 injuries without our perception was nil.

I was surprised and frightened with the fact that,
1.The school was totally unaware of 3 injuries. It's not easy to overlook 3 times injury ??
2. They didn't consider the possibility of injury at school even though they overlooked 3 injuries (paid less attention to children ??)

Unfortunately, our daughter was 2 years old and couldn't explain what happened at school. But she was really scared of the school so we withdrew our daughter next day. I heard at least 2 more incident at this school & those are posted to some website.","2018-05-29T16:26:09.934Z","0","f k","5","false",,,"en","7 years ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRcXBYUVBBEAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRcXBYUVBBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x68ce408f72448162!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDQqpXQPA%7CCgwIof612AUQgOuuvQM%7C?hl=en","101569170394019412030","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWRlm5koXxUGLZgraRNwFysP3moHNzrR8f89QIAoGEC36lHutBi=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101569170394019412030?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My girl comes back happy and likes attending school. She is also enjoying the extra weekly Kindermusik enrichment class (it’s optional) that we signed her up for. Her speech and vocabulary has developed by leaps and bounds since the very first week she joined the school—I remain very impressed by this.

Sometimes, parents are asked to be involved a little in the kids’ projects, and I find it a good way for us to remain connected and in tune with what the kids are doing in school.

"Cheston Montessori Preschools","5","I visited many preschools before enrolling my son in Cheston, but after attending Cheston's open house I quickly decided to enroll him there. We are Japanese and my son couldn't speak English or Chinese, but Ms Janice and the other teachers helped him get used to the school.
It has been five months since my son started kindergarten, and I am really glad that I chose Cheston. He quickly adapted to school life and seems to have grown so much. In addition to the daily activities, there are field trips, various events, and recently a school camp where my son stayed overnight away from home with his friends and teachers for the first time, and he came back feeling very confident.

It was a big decision for us to send our child to a local preschool in a foreign country, but now I feel that it was the right decision to send my son to Cheston Montessori Preschool. I would like to thank the principal, Ms Janice, my homeroom teacher, Ms Doreen, and all the other teachers.","2025-06-14T07:09:47.470Z","0","WY","2","false",,,"en","2 months ago",,"Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xoRmRUZ3lTbFpQY1hOeFFXWnhkMnhxY21oSU0xRRAB","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90C1KJKbw7xhgJt97EPXxcSfymk9n6wm3yivSEswe4ukTyK_4PlcQWMNSdroiYMKlld3ChaJS52DuiM30c-TqVr7doCg3qSwq5Lc62HydQNxDENNwYzOvAWLAmsLoectJGY-fULIJbRGPAuo","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90CNZSCcvwwaNGgvXJGuj8dBUG3P3vBr5ZFwpTn_RrUZ9ZtJdWNTqNNbD-YP3evJAPUf3XTTQm8-MDwKIRvLcnmNr0d7W2vadY5TlolXUIkrLy11xrVosULata-VM2OUmZ3DK7aPwhg4-RR_",,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sCi9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xoRmRUZ3lTbFpQY1hOeFFXWnhkMnhxY21oSU0xRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x63683ebba9d11421!3m1!1s2@1:CAIQACodChtycF9oOlhFdTgySlZPcXNxQWZxd2xqcmhIM1E%7C0cIH-vR-wSU%7C?hl=en","112333837471705264905","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVVCWsnWJJzb6hg0AGuJCnmzhb7twfleAWjbNSWzdjcYtl4NOjVNA=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112333837471705264905?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cheston Montessori Preschools","5","My LO joined N2 recently, and quickly adapted to the new environment. Within a few weeks, we could see positive behavioural changes, influenced by mixing around with older cohort that show empathy and kindness. Small cohort size also allowed teachers to be able to pay closer attention to my LO’s development stages and partner with parents like ourselves to support child’s growth & learning. It was especially lovely to see how kids know almost everyone in the school and are well-connected!

The school curriculum also is montessori based, and incorporates fun learning themes each term, with learning field trips. My LO is also looking forward to first school camp in June as well!

"Cheston Montessori Preschools","5","We are incredibly grateful for the care and dedication shown by the teachers and staff at Cheston Montessori. Our baby was enrolled when I was preparing to return to work after my maternity leave, and now at over 9 months, we've seen remarkable progress in her development. She's thriving at infant care - she knows how to clap her hands, reacts to expressions, and moves her body when music is played. We feel at ease knowing she's in good hands while we are at work. The frequent updates on her activities at infant care are heartwarming, and we can see that our baby is happy spending time with her teachers and her baby friends.

A big thank you to Teacher Irene, the infant care lead, Principal Janice, Teacher Annu, Teacher Marliana, Teacher Sharon, LeeLee Laoshi, Teacher Sya, and all the staff (including teachers from the other groups who sometimes receive our baby when we drop her off at the infant care)!","2025-04-05T06:55:19.800Z","0","Ivy Aw","2","false",,,"en","4 months ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNJNTVhelN3EAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNJNTVhelN3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x63683ebba9d11421!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgMCI55azSw%7CCgwI16fDvwYQ2KLI_QI%7C?hl=en","102359357380190172899","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJrzXV7nGeK3QrbDCGW2c05PuG4qI8rb_4MXEu_HhoboPkf-Q=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102359357380190172899?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Cheston Montessori Preschools","5","My husband and I sent my 7 month old to Cheston at Clementi and it was the best decision we made. When we sent him, he wasn’t eating and didn’t show signs of having any tooth. We were highly concerned as to how he would do food wise in school. But over time and with a lot of guidance and patience from his IFC teachers, he was able to start on purées and fruits a little by little. And when he transitioned to porridge after turning 1, he did even better on that and slowly was introduced to more solids.

I appreciate the constant updates from the teachers and having an open line of communication with the principal put me at ease to know that my child was well supported and taken care of and that my concerns were always heard and responded to.

From my child taking his first steps to him learning to sit and read and focus on an activity, I'm very glad for his teachers and all the guidance, love and passion put into ensuring his growth.

I would like to specially mention his IFC Teachers Irene, Reena, Jes, Noraini and Principal Janice for every bit of confidence, love, compassion and care that they put into caring for and instilling values to my child.","2024-07-02T02:33:45.455Z","0","Gaithri Haridas","6","false",,,"en","a year ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURMMTdxcUN3EAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURMMTdxcUN3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x63683ebba9d11421!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDL17qqCw%7CCgwIic6NtAYQiL6I2QE%7C?hl=en","110278348618203244968","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKZj65r3_jJdQqX1FaJ3KCApvThd4Xb0drajoTZrTfLeJqzWA=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110278348618203244968?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She finally settled down at Cheston Montessori and we’ve never regretted that choice as we watch her grow into a confident, cheerful, cheeky 6 year old. She has a better grasp of mandarin than her parents, her interest to read English story books albeit slow but is still beyond her age level, her ability to pick up basic maths concepts are always startling to us as we never sent her for any additional extracurricular classes after her Preschool at Cheston. The Cheston teachers’ patience, and interaction with every child in the school is evident regardless of the level of class they teach. All the kids know all the teachers and staff. The kids know every child’s name in every level too. It’s a small comfortable and safe ‘village’ like of interactions and friendly environment which my LO has grown up in at CHESTON for the last 4 important years of her childhood.

"Cheston Montessori Preschools","5","Cheston Montessori (Clementi Community Centre, Level 3)

We sent our first son to Cheston Montessori in Dec 2020, when he was 4 months old. Being new parents, we were initially apprehensive about sending him to infant care, and did not know what to expect. Our apprehensions, however, were soon dispelled. The staff were warm and friendly, patient with our queries, and accommodating about our requests. They provided us timely updates about the care and feeding of our son, were always willing to share about his day when we picked him up, and generous with advice without being prescriptive or intrusive.

All this would have been ample reason for us to give a 5 starred review. But Cheston and its staff went beyond this. They had an engaging programme for our son, teaching him many things and developing his growing mind through creative and age-appropriate activities. The staff made it a point to get to know our son as an individual, and share specific insights which helped us to get to know him better too. Their warmth and professionalism were instrumental in our son’s development, and their responsibility in executing their duty of care allowed us to return to full-time work without having to worry.

We have now sent our second son (4 months old) to Cheston, and are so glad to have their support and care again. Cheston has worked hard to make the school a second home, a second family, for the children, regardless of age.

"ACS International","5","Such a normal school in all the right ways.  Small class sizes, welcoming staff, caring teachers, strong pastoral care system and values.  Opportunities to try and take part in lots of different CCAs without needing to be a world champion.  No huge fancy campus, but well equipped classrooms filled with student's work and colour. They get great academic results, without being too academically selective, because the children are empowered, happy, and taught well.  If only more schools could be like this, and the planet may be a happier place.  If you are looking at other top schools like SJI-I, think again and try out ACS-I too.  It's a pleasant change.","2025-01-30T07:16:16.132Z","0","Emma Lee","3","false",,,"en","6 months ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNBdkl1cnBBRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNBdkl1cnBBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xaf1c18a5ccee13c!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgMCAvIurpAE%7CCgsIwM7svAYQkMyUPw%7C?hl=en","106581390893649590871","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJxLy-0g_WtNgX0GR_tyL5LusW8BOSCZ-AocJBg1gLqBesG2A=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106581390893649590871?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Facilities are smaller than other international schools, but it has everything a family could want, and the curriculum and strong IB results speak for themselves.  The Christian values shine strongly.

I have often thought it a shame the school don’t do more on social media or their website, as it’s much better than what you see on the surface (unlike other schools who are very slick with marketing and have hollow promises).","2024-08-06T23:57:40.378Z","0","Emma","2","false",,,"en","a year ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURiNlpqSnNBRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURiNlpqSnNBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xaf1c18a5ccee13c!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDb6ZjJsAE%7CCgwI9PDKtQYQsPDUtAE%7C?hl=en","112445786722811606038","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLyjyIFp1BC4xd3juHfi59-BaBuy-OH83MIlKHbwIMuGJ89pw=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112445786722811606038?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ACS International","5","I wanted a different experience for my older girl after PSLE and attended the open houses of all the local intl schools. We chose ACS Intl due to a few factors, proximity, Alma Mater of husband and from the general feel of the school. We noticed during the open house that the kids were allowed to present and run some parts of it independently. This was a good sign - didn’t matter if it wasn’t 100% perfection as kids would learn how to talk to adults and present themselves. We took the plunge and she was our guinea pig. She completed four happy years there and went on school trips where she learnt how to look after herself away from home. Prepared her well to study overseas. Teachers are kind and able to provide actual detailed feedback. As an example, I was told she could benefit from cooking more at home to help with her Chemistry practical skills which was very true. After that her sibling also joined the school and am happy to say the experience is consistent. If you want happy well adjusted kids I can recommend this school. I must add that bullying is not tolerated and the school is quick to address behavioral issues. In terms of academics your child should have no issues if they do their work consistently as tests are based on what they teach at school and the school has a good balance between work and play. For CCAs lots of options and chances to try new things. I have met random parents from the school over the years and most have used the word “thrive” to describe their child’s experience. Overall the intangible things I have noticed in both kids are an increase in confidence, they are not scared to sign up for new things and willing to take the risk of failure after one or two years here,  best is yet to be!","2024-03-27T07:36:18.849Z","0","Yeha Hello","3","false",,,"en","Edited a year ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5ekpQelNBEAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5ekpQelNBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xaf1c18a5ccee13c!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgID9zJPzSA%7CCgwI8piPsAYQqPTqlAM%7C?hl=en","111291508247123978376","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIR0mc7iNo9ZlLwQCdEEMaCt0gPPwdY24J7ACIu_vAfottzhQ=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111291508247123978376?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We came from a local school and transitioning to ACS is a world of difference. The teachers are nurturing and my child feels supported, she loves going to school and she gets a great exposure to a diverse global community. The parent community is very strong not just within the class but across year 1 parent community. Parents are given lots of opportunities to support school activities and it makes it a nurturing environment.  Finally, the school leadership has made a lot of efforts to update and engage parents eg parent tutor night, meet the principal sessions which is great. Only area of improvement I suggest would be to improve the variety of canteen food.","2024-03-26T00:57:16.459Z","0","Xante Koh","31","true",,,"en","a year ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEd29yQWNnEAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEd29yQWNnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xaf1c18a5ccee13c!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICDworAcg%7CCgwI7LqIsAYQ4JSi2wE%7C?hl=en","111197919988181279588","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUOMjMl7AXp3sB5tzwlomuV1H_LxnRvYL7ZCJdtRIqZ7V5zCn1X=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111197919988181279588?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ACS International","1","Calling the school admissions this afternoon on behalf of a foreign student and simply asking what the difference was between Acs international and Acs independent sent the man who picked up my call into a diatribe including accusing me of some form of un-Singaporean-ness in helping to get more information for a newly arrived foreign student…

All this while keeping me on speaker phone without the courtesy of picking up the receiver to speak with me properly and professionally.

What a representative for the school and what  a ghastly example to set for the students.","2023-11-09T09:13:21.544Z","0","Carolyn Seah","184","true",,,"en","a year ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURGN2U2eGNnEAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURGN2U2eGNnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xaf1c18a5ccee13c!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDF7e6xcg%7CCgwIscWyqgYQwN_XgwI%7C?hl=en","109402135233363771086","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWe8qySmPgWcQdJgUKUF6EkQU2p-9YZTd-jU7qNxSIvsom_wUsr=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109402135233363771086?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"My First Skool at Blk 656C Jurong West St 61","5","I have enrolled both my children in this branch since 2020. At first I was skeptical about choosing MFS due to hearing some feedbacks, but I am glad to have chosen this school. It has met my expectations thus far.
Both my children have food allergies, the school has made arrangements and has dealed with the situation well.
I love how the teachers and principal are interactive and constantly on the lookout for the kids. We can definitely tell how much kids enjoyed the school by their interaction with the teachers, principals and school aunties. There are also alot of activities for the children. They do have after school programmes like abacus which i think is a great addition to the curriculum.
Apart from fun activities, they do have academic progression which i do think is also important.

"My First Skool at Blk 656C Jurong West St 61","5","My son attended My First Skool (JWC06) since he was 4 months old and now, he is in Nursery. Throughout his education at the centre, he had amazing teachers. The Principal and all the teachers are very warm, approachable, enthusiastic and caring in their interactions with the children and parents.  They are always updating me about my son during send off and pick up, updates in the communication book, child's portfolio, parents portal and meet the parents sessions are some of the useful communication channels  that I find useful to get insights in his progress in school.  The teachers make observations and document them to keep track of the children’s development and ensure that they reach their milestones. The teachers supported, encouraged and helped in other aspects such as doing daily routines independently, eating their fruits and veges and even potty training. The teachers, at every level built great relationships with him. This makes him feel safe in school and in turn, enjoys going to school.
The centre teachers take a lot of time and effort to make the classroom a conducive and playful atmosphere for the children based on the the different learning themes throughout the year. This sets an engaging atmosphere for them to play and learn. My son always talks about the different themes at the Dramatic Corner and Learning Centres that the teachers prepared. The centre encourage learning and bonding time at home with the take home activities that are based on the learning themes. The classrooms are clean and neat.  Baskets with learning tools and toys are organised neatly in shelves so that the children can easily pick them based on their interest.
The centre has a well rounded curriculum.  Some of the lessons that my son enjoys are music and movement, story telling,  phonics, gross and fine motor activities and outdoor walks in the neighbourhood. His learning experiences in the centre helped and encouraged him to be a curious learner and confident little boy!","2022-05-17T17:32:27.920Z","0","Liyana Zolpakar","8","false",,,"en","3 years ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyc2VHdkt3EAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyc2VHdkt3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x59c0354a250d2d2d!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgID2seGvKw%7CCgwIq7iPlAYQuNr6tgM%7C?hl=en","115504969608909952722","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLzHaIn1J9GG5QGvhKacv2EN-Nr05ORZHqSCsxfJhgniMaPGA=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115504969608909952722?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My son enrolled from 4 months old, and now we already with this center more than 1.5 years. I appreciate all teachers raise and educate my son with patience. He loves teachers over there and very happy to see he growth and learn something new everyday.

Although they do not have fancy ""app"" for parents to chat with teachers or school, however, all information shared timely to parents by call or daily communication during drop-off and pick up. Teachers will pay attention on the kids instead their phone, I think this is the utmost important that you do not wish teachers to check the phone all day.

Also, this school is pay seriously attention on hygiene, this is really important during COVID period. They follow the highest standard, deep clean every time when a COVID case reported. Therefore, even thought during pandemic period, there's no pandemic in this center.

This school may not have a fancy looks, but I think the most important is teachers, curriculum and principle how they manage the school ensure kids growth happily. Also, to find a team who you can trust, especially for double income family who without support from grandparents is really important.

"Brighton Montessori Sunset","5","My daughter has multiple, severe food allergies, so keeping her safe was our utmost priority when selecting her preschool. The teachers at Brighton Montessori at Sunset Way have been so caring and helpful, and have kept her safe from the very beginning, for which we are immensely grateful. They would give us a heads up on any food-based activities, and would also try to source safe alternatives for her if possible. Special shout out to Ms. Sharmaine, Ms. Cindy and Wang Lao Shi for always being so thoughtful towards her allergies! They've even set up a snack basket for her for birthday celebrations; Wang Laoshi even went to the extent of specially preparing a safe MSW durian filling just so my girl could partake in the mooncake making activity!

We also really love the weekly outdoor runs the kids go on, along the nature canal where they can spot monitor lizards and otters!

Curriculum-wise, Brighton has a dedicated approach for English and Math, catered to each child's learning pace. Both my girls picked up reading very quickly under Ms. Sharmaine's guidance. That said, the school is known to be quite academically-focused especially from K1 onwards - they prepare the child well for primary school but it also comes with quite a bit of homework every week!

Both my children enjoyed their time at this school, and we have been blessed with lovely teachers we can trust!","2025-04-17T01:18:03.640Z","0","Tan Deborah","9","false",,,"en","4 months ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNvOXFfWFJnEAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNvOXFfWFJnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x67bfdb27f414d265!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgMCo9q_XRg%7CCgwIy62BwAYQoNaZsQI%7C?hl=en","105752939257931612147","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocI15Ftf6iYTOcdzeA5lQWJrwvgCnMoN-bCrfVi0sOrxTlwhKw=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105752939257931612147?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Nan Hua High School","4","This school is like 'Darling in the franxx' anime. Started quite nice. Attracted your attention. All nice and chill till around the second half. With your emotions going up and down.

Anyways, tbh, many excess classes that we dont care, tiring life, overly strict regulations to the point where you ask is this even necessary? and we can't forget toilets that are a little disturbing. Only has one bus route to get there the fastest, so 189 bus is your only way to get to school normally. The bust stop outside school is absolute c- crowded. Chill school without much happening around you, those types where days can fly by with nothing happening. Relationships are only between male and female students with their homework and textbooks.

"Nan Hua High School","1","Dear Principal on Nan Hua High School

I am writing to inform you of a disturbing behavior I have observed from students of Nan Hua High School. Many Nan Hua students were very loud on the bus which my peers and I found very disruptive.

The Nan Hua students have also crowded around the bus stop and block the pathway outside the bus stop making it very hard to navigate without going off the path and onto the grass patch. As a small comparison conversations between the NUS high students cannot be heard.

This is not the first incident of Nan Hua students being loud in public and this behavior has been observed for months without noticeable change or effort to stop.

I would like to request that the teachers of your institution kindly advice students to try to be less loud and be more socially aware of their behavior and conduct when in public especially on public transport or public spaces during peak hours where there are members of the public rushing to get to their destination and it is already very difficult without the Nan Hua students obstructing the pathways.

Yours sincerely,
Resident of Clementi","2025-04-25T10:29:26.296Z","0","HiHi","1","false",,,"en","4 months ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURvdnFIMHBBRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURvdnFIMHBBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x2584ef1c02f4f3dc!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgMDovqH0pAE%7CCgwIhsitwAYQ8M_CjQE%7C?hl=en","110584998479464010193","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKp6bOFHHNHm4vGDYcr2Tb2XkHZv6_rJcyqtjXDDXly7mHj8w=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110584998479464010193?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They truly take the time to understand each child’s needs, and it shows in how much my daughter loves going to school every day.

The environment is warm and nurturing, and we can see how much effort the team puts into creating meaningful learning experiences.

"Learning Vision Nanyang Technological University","5","We have been with NTU@LV since my firstborn, who has since graduated to primary school, and now my younger child is here too. Over the years, we’ve consistently seen the same dedication and professionalism from the teachers. Everyone knows their role well, and we’ve never once felt that the teachers were unsure of what they were doing. They are patient, caring, and always approachable.

One of the things we truly appreciate is the open-door policy. Parents are free to walk into the classroom to send or fetch their children, and it gives us great peace of mind knowing that the school has nothing to hide.

My husband loves the school so much that when I once suggested transferring our child to a nearer preschool for convenience, he completely disagreed—because he felt the care and quality here is unmatched.

We are very grateful for the teachers’ dedication and genuine care.
Thank u LV @NTU!!

"Learning Vision Nanyang Technological University","5","We absolutely love the teachers and the nurturing environment at this preschool! My kids are now in K2 and PG, and our twins in PG have been here since they were just 3 months old in infant care.

Like any parents, we were initially worried about our babies being in infant care so young but thanks to their caring IFC teachers (Teacher Joy and Teacher Yana) and the clean, safe environment, our twins thrived in infant care and transitioned to PG smoothly.

Of course, like any preschool, there are occasional outbreaks (e.g. HFMD), but the school always keeps parents informed promptly and sanitises the classrooms thoroughly.

One of my children’s favourite parts of the day is outdoor time; the school has a large outdoor playground and a grass patch where the kids get to explore daily.

The principal, Ms Jayne, and her team are always on the ground, approachable, and keep communication open. Thanks to them, we can go to work with peace of mind knowing our children are in good hands. If you’re working in NTU or live around the area, I highly recommend sending your kids to this preschool.","2025-08-12T03:52:37.137Z","0","Rahila Daud","3","false",,,"en","2 weeks ago",,"Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21SZk1VSjBRek5JT0Uxa09Ha3laVEp4WkZrMFVWRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sCi9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21SZk1VSjBRek5JT0Uxa09Ha3laVEp4WkZrMFVWRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xfeb4faa56de07300!3m1!1s2@1:CAIQACodChtycF9oOmRfMUJ0QzNIOE1kOGkyZTJxZFk0UVE%7C0cafe47D1Ca%7C?hl=en","101409814858239205533","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXgoT0dr0m94lT2tYLgdfaAhYuXSuLFUqgSB2VsFy9meQ0oxtSB=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101409814858239205533?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Learning Vision Nanyang Technological University","5","Learning Vision @ NTU has a lovely environment and surrounded by lush greenery. The spacious building, complete with a playground and a beautiful grass patch, provides a perfect balance between indoor and outdoor activities. The cheerful teachers have made my son adapt wonderfully, giving each student ample attention. My son chose the 'Young Einstein' enrichment program and is always excited to show what he's created in class. The school hosts numerous events, from field trips to Parents' Day, and celebrates every religious holiday, promoting a rich sense of diversity.
My son learned a lot of things from this school. Eight months ago, when he started school here, he didn't even speak or understand Mandarin. Now he has a basic understanding of Mandarin and is happy to learn more. I appreciate the assistance and support given to my son during his time at Learning Vision.","2024-06-13T13:25:21.216Z","0","Alyta Widiana","26","true",,,"en","a year ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR6cjViSlhREAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR6cjViSlhREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xfeb4faa56de07300!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDzr5bJXQ%7CCgsIwearswYQ4LGnZw%7C?hl=en","109257929718076305679","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXbqRnSA3oFcBvrj3uzkrbzm_Cv9yRWDRjDulJij6AKOWColesT=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109257929718076305679?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Grace Orchard School","1","Supposedly a SPED school but will pick and choose their own students to make their lives easier and only accept students with neurotypical behaviors. Demands for more documentation than is needed for the already-convoluted MOE SPED school application process, only to choose to ignore all reports in favor of a deeply-flawed 2-day admission screening that even a layperson not trained in psychology would know is statistically skewed. Completely unethical and goes against the basic ethos of education that puts the MOE fraternity to shame.","2024-08-28T10:42:52.161Z","0","Eunice Koh","126","true",,,"en","11 months ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3ODVxY25nRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3ODVxY25nRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x161f29fc448c19f7!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgID785qcngE%7CCgsIrP67tgYQ0JKSTQ%7C?hl=en","101428588084246815530","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKFYfXAxWEnPyUjr42mgEuNvwRj8Dnft5TgN35mXmOOjuVOxfM=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101428588084246815530?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then on the other side there’s those really nice angels who are actually nice and literal angels, and actually care to see the toxicity their schoolmates can inflict on people like me, who’re also extremely rational and don’t take biases. I don’t have much friends here as compared to other schools (people on the first half of the spectrum will probably say that I don’t even have any friends, or attack me for making this review [yk who you are from 1D]) but I like the diversity here. 3/5.","2025-08-06T23:04:04.335Z","0","Aydan Joshua Chan Jan (Rafflesinst)","5","false",,,"en","Edited 3 weeks ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURmNHJqU2VREAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURmNHJqU2VREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xcbcfd322dea1c70f!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDf4rjSeQ%7C0cZxxZJ0Hur%7C?hl=en","106120520234822920672","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocL9XZBYXVansE2cgq3YfOc_b7eDCjOPwZ_nvjsfisTWjJnC2w=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106120520234822920672?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Alpha Green Preschool Bukit Timah","5","This is a lovely preschool surrounded by nature. They have a nice garden and outdoor space , mainly shaded ( differently from other schools I have seen)
They are committed to spend at least 3 hrs outside and they have recently invited parents for outdoor learning with the kids. My 3 yo son deeply loves the water play once a week and the gardening class .
They also have ballet and music classes which have helped him to be more aware of his body and movements, following the rhythm.

It s a small school, in my perspective much more caring than a big one ( where we went before ) , sometimes might feel less structured and organised than a big one, sometimes it s penalized by the proximity with GESS , but the owner is really putting her heart on it ( as well as her kids - which says it all) and our son is very happy there.","2023-06-22T04:21:43.152Z","0","chiara zen","121","true",,,"en","2 years ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKaklxbUVBEAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKaklxbUVBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x495aa2ebf3b2570c!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICJjIqmEA%7CCgsI15jPpAYQwLTPSA%7C?hl=en","109581223854549627841","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXOI4tXETLH_JHBgao_ve2IIt4p9S1P69YsfrF6cKrF0NNFbUek=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109581223854549627841?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Communication is frequent (I was receiving updates on what my son was doing daily!) and the bilingual immersion was an A++++. Nutrition wise - they offer a selection of healthy food for the kids to pick and choose. From the short stint when my son was attending Alpha Green, I noticed he became more open to trying new foods and was more independent in eating. His mandarin improved (he was able to sing twinkle twinkle little star in mandarin!) as well.

Would have loved to continue but cost is an issue for us, and for some reason my son didn’t quite enjoy himself (he cried a lot on drop off and expressed he really didn’t want to go), hence didn’t continue.","2022-05-27T03:11:27.494Z","0","Ashley Ng","32","true",,,"en","3 years ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycDRxM3VBRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycDRxM3VBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x495aa2ebf3b2570c!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgID2p4q3uAE%7CCgwI34LBlAYQ-Ov56wE%7C?hl=en","111905743597372945113","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV_4ZUjC1TG6dz6XrTeDM5SGsEbCuSUZViVnH6uMR-7K7Dufvi3=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111905743597372945113?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She also is given the chance to interact and play with kids across the age groups as the school has activities for everyone to attend… and from the daily photos, interesting events like science projects or art projects can be held for kids of different ages.

Often when I go pick her up, she doesn’t want to go home because school has been so fun.

"MindChamps PreSchool @ Fusionopolis","5","We’ve had a wonderful experience with MindChamps at Fusionopolis. The environment is always clean, well-maintained, and thoughtfully organized, which gives us great peace of mind as parents. What truly sets this preschool apart, though, are the amazing teachers. They are consistently warm, caring, and nurturing — it’s clear they genuinely care about the well-being and development of each child. Our kids are always excited to go to school, and we’ve seen them grow in confidence and curiosity thanks to the supportive and encouraging atmosphere. We’re very happy to be part of the MindChamps family!","2025-05-10T04:00:17.203Z","0","Isabel Goh","8","false",,,"en","3 months ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VOS0t1OGJUNnNueFdBEAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VOS0t1OGJUNnNueFdBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x2a3d7781b215b787!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKENKKu8bT6snxWA%7CCgsI0Z77wAYQgNKPYQ%7C?hl=en","108723591912831538016","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKNHzycXd3kBvOFmTvoL2yZpF1dF7r8JrTkFf7P9T3eUXToFg=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108723591912831538016?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"MindChamps PreSchool @ JTC Summit","5","I am incredibly grateful to the wonderful teachers at my son's preschool for their dedication, love, and hard work in teaching my son, Evan. The amount of patience and effort they put into their work is truly commendable.

A special mention goes to the recent Mother's Day session, which was beautifully organized by the teachers. They went above and beyond to ensure that the event was memorable for both the children and the mothers. The class performed two songs, ""You are my sunshine"" and ""纸飞机"" and it was heartwarming to see Evan sing and dance with such joy and confidence.

We also had a delightful gourmet session as part of the bonding activities, which was a fantastic experience for both Evan and me. It was a wonderful opportunity to connect and create lasting memories together.

I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to the amazing teachers: Ms Ellie, Ms Amenda, JinJin 老师，Dai 老师, Ms Trina, Ms Chris, and Ms Steph. Your dedication and passion for teaching have made a significant impact on Evan's growth and development.

Thank you for everything you do!

"MindChamps PreSchool @ JTC Summit","5","Our journey into MindChamps begin when Dexter was 18 months old. At
that point of time, we were looking to place him at a pre-school where
we will feel assured that he will be well taken care of, whilst both of us
were at work. Although that seems like a minuscule requirement of ours,
we were apprehensive after visiting several schools in the vicinity. As we
had nephews who were previously enrolled in MindChamps, we were
well aware of their branding and quality. We had witnessed our nephews’
progress and growth over the years and were impressed with the
outcomes.
Despite the overwhelming demand, we were fortunate to gain a placing
for Dexter in PG. He went on to spend 5 fruitful years in MindChamps
under the guidance of various teachers who have impacted his life. The
Principal, Ms Chris has been our beacon of light as we navigated
through Dexter’s early childhood. She was always just a phone call away
and a pillar of strength for us especially during the Covid period. The
teachers whom Dexter cross path with were equally dedicated and
remarkable. Ms Steph, who helmed Dexter’s PG to N2 class and Ms Zoe
who took over for K1 to K2. Ms Elli, Dexter’s phonics teacher and one
whom he looks forward to greeting every morning when he arrives at
school. Ms Xue, his Mandarin Teacher whom has miraculously made
him enjoy learning the language. Ah Yi, the chef who churns out healthy
meals for Dexter daily.
Both Mummy and myself are eternally grateful to all the staff at
MindChamps JTC as we understand that it takes a village to raise a
child. We want to extend our sincere appreciation and deepest thanks to
every single staff past and present. We are certain MindChamps has left
an imprint in Dexter’s developmental years and we have nothing but
positive memories of his time there. We wish MindChamps many more
good years in JTC and rest assured if we encounter any potential
enquries regarding preschool, Ms Chris’s mobile will be ringing.
Yours Sincerely,
Mr and Mrs Wan","2024-08-30T02:43:26.623Z","0","Chloe","4","false",,,"en","11 months ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3ejdPbEdnEAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3ejdPbEdnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xf0f5f366dc95f4f1!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgID7z7OlGg%7CCgwIzuPEtgYQoImhqQI%7C?hl=en","105708076337188476978","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLy7m90wN6YKAMHc-bmqK5L_0UNPyMLkajSL44_4xoExwrZkQ=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105708076337188476978?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ELF Preschool","5","My elder child was with ELF from Nursery 1 and graduated last year in 2022. She has many fond memories of the years spent at ELF - of the teachers there as well as the many good friends she has made over the years. The teachers and staff at ELF are always very caring and nurturing towards the children. They are also always thinking of creative ways to make their lessons interesting and engaging for the kids. The curriculum is also a well planned one which will prepare the children well for their transition to Primary One. After school fun like the inflatable bouncy castle and the on-site playground are also big hits with the kids, who are often then not reluctant to go home too early. Overall, my experience with ELF as a parent is liken to that of a big family where everyone, be it the parents or staff, work hand in hand to provide a homely yet conducive environment for the children to grow and blossom in. Needless to say, the wonderful experience we have with ELF was the reason we enrolled our youngest with their Playgroup programme as soon as she reached the minimum age requirement and we are looking forward to seeing our youngest blossom too under the guidance and care given by the teachers and staff at ELF.","2023-01-20T15:15:51.243Z","0","Stephanie Choo","15","true",,,"en","2 years ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdnZ5T3N3RRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCdnZ5T3N3RRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x717d5e0804ff31f0!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDBvvyOswE%7CCgsIp-CqngYQoIv4cw%7C?hl=en","103039175007551612739","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUZuu_WDDFRLXf1fzO1jbbbXnoc1ty7-rksmN3YStOjkj_4jiTq=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103039175007551612739?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The environment is warm, nurturing, and full of care. The teachers are incredibly attentive and consistently share thoughtful updates, photos, and any important news—always promptly.

We’re especially grateful to Ms. Ros, Ms. Reva, Peng Laoshi, and Ms. Elly for the genuine care and support they gave our child. Their encouragement has helped him grow in confidence and joy.

He especially loved the outdoor playtime and the engaging extracurriculars like cooking, Brain Boosters and Show & Tell.

Our 3-year-old attended for five months, and the growth we’ve seen has been amazing. The teachers are incredibly nurturing, patient, and genuinely passionate about what they do. They created a warm and welcoming environment where our child felt safe, confident, and excited to learn every day.

We especially appreciated how they fostered independence, creativity, and a love for learning through hands-on activities and thoughtful guidance. Even after just a few months, we noticed improvements in communication, social skills, and problem-solving abilities.

We’re so grateful to Miss Ross and her entire team for making our child’s first school experience such a positive and enriching one. Highly recommend to any parents looking for a caring and inspiring Montessori program!","2025-05-01T01:59:46.789Z","0","akshay ani","12","true",,,"en","3 months ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNZbVB2Rkd3EAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNZbVB2Rkd3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xcd16695adfa497cc!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgMCYmPvFGw%7CCgwIkqvLwAYQ6L6--AI%7C?hl=en","116419179895268395231","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX6sHj4TvpZGbgcHis1foGNXP43kVnN38C_hAnvtREfQWvQiVSe6Q=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116419179895268395231?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Starshine Montessori at Hillview - Childcare Centre and Preschool","5","My daughter's first schooling started with Starshine Montessori and we are glad with our decision. Though she was crying during initial days, the teachers were passionate and experienced enough to make the smooth transition to make her adapting to the new environment. Just believe in them :)

We see our daughter was learning new things everyday. Be it the social etiquettes, academics and behavioural aspects, we are proud of her. Thanks to the teachers at Starshine Montessori.

It's a Chinese immersion preschool, teaching Chinese to the students as second language apart from English. The lessons are interactive and fun for the kids and my daughter enjoyed being there.

The outdoor and pool activities are held with at most care and security. Regular feedback were shared and the student to teacher ratio is maintained well.

I wish the faculties, all the very best to keep up the good work.","2024-10-03T01:17:26.732Z","0","Lokesh G","4","false",,,"en","10 months ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURudU52MktnEAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURudU52MktnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xcd16695adfa497cc!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDnuNv2Kg%7CCgwIpuH3twYQ4OGj3QI%7C?hl=en","108995624955585996430","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUuyEGGks4rCZFh5TY4OB6iKpEI1s_RJqnvD3E4ykDZJUGGXRdJ=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108995624955585996430?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Starshine Montessori at Hillview - Childcare Centre and Preschool","5","My experience with Starshine Montessori has been nothing short of exceptional. From the moment my son, stepped foot into the nurturing environment of Nursery 1, to the incredible growth and development witnessed through Nursery 2 and reached Kindergarten 1, this school has truly been a beacon of excellence in early childhood education.

The Montessori approach adopted by Starshine Montessori is nothing short of transformative. It's evident that every aspect of the curriculum is meticulously designed to foster independence, creativity, and a love for learning in each child. My son has thrived in this environment, not only academically but also socially and emotionally.

The dedication and passion of the teachers and staff are notable especially their principal Ms Ros. Their unwavering commitment to each child's individual needs create a supportive and enriching atmosphere where every child feels valued and empowered. The small class sizes ensure personalized attention, allowing my son to flourish at his own pace while being gently encouraged to reach his full potential.

The facilities at Starshine Montessori are superb, providing a safe and stimulating environment conducive to exploration and discovery. From well-equipped classrooms to spacious outdoor play areas, every space is thoughtfully designed to enhance his learning experience.

Communication with the school has been seamless, with regular updates on my son's progress through the Class dojo App and opportunities for parent involvement. The sense of community fostered by Starshine Montessori is truly remarkable, creating a partnership between parents and teachers in the journey of each child's education.

In conclusion, I cannot recommend Starshine Montessori highly enough. It has been an absolute privilege to be part of this wonderful school community, and I am confident that the foundation laid here will continue to shape my son's future success.

Thank you, Starshine Montessori, for being a shining star in the Pre-school educational landscape.","2024-01-26T09:57:53.888Z","0","Kenji Ng","2","true",,,"en","a year ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUROMjdMM3RBRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUROMjdMM3RBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xcd16695adfa497cc!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDN27L3tAE%7CCgwIoYTOrQYQ6Jq6pwM%7C?hl=en","110700776297661448630","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKRHTY-FN5dyGCRt2E8dOUC8fIM5jYfIVlYo7yycUg79gtNrg=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110700776297661448630?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Kensington Preschool","5","We've had a good experience sending our child to the preschool in the past few months, observing -
- Caring and responsible teachers who show a genuine heart for the children, are warm and approachable, and are able to handle different personalities well. This was very important to us, as the teachers attitudes and behaviours have direct impact on a child's engagement and responsiveness to their teaching. The teachers also went out of their way to help my child feel comfortable when she was unwell. We are comforted that she is receiving good care.
- Regular updates via app with photos of activities, syllabus, and informal chats during daily pickup / drop off. This keeps us informed of how our child is progressing and adapting.
- Structured learning program coupled with montessori pedagogy encouraging independence, which sets the children up well in their growth and development.
- Peaceful and private premise located in a standalone house providing safe, calm, and conducive environment.
- Celebration of special occasions (eg mooncake festival, children's day, etc) as well as special activities (eg soccer days, outing days, excursions) to enrich the overall learning experience.","2024-10-14T00:42:18.685Z","0","Alyssa He","5","false",,,"en","10 months ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYclBIdVNBEAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYclBIdVNBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xb50bdf79f9ffacbd!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICXrPHuSA%7CCgwI6tGxuAYQyNHwxgI%7C?hl=en","101288569969790455851","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIZKHHvd_2fZVc6iftDW5DFx8kiMM5Bi8r6y0tBEeS3XGfV-A=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101288569969790455851?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We could see her greater progress in all such as communication skills, functional growth, emotional developments, etc.

Recently, she has become more open-minded which we could not imagine from her shyness in the very beginning when she enrolled in.

We are now worry-free to take her to Australia and pretty sure that she will manage herself to settle down to the new environment.

Without your kind help, we would not have decided to make a move to our migration plan to Australia.

Huge appreciation again to your all the staff supported for our daughter!","2023-04-29T03:11:58.111Z","0","松下良","2","false","2023-10-20T05:40:15.000Z","Thank you for the review.","en","2 years ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMllmMzNBRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMllmMzNBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xb50bdf79f9ffacbd!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDR2Yf33AE%7CCgsI_pWyogYQ4ID9NA%7C?hl=en","107604421349578989350","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVtmHIbAjdBPjTpa9WX8jDuwvoNttwUhN3rU642cth7e7goDA4V=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107604421349578989350?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The environment is clean and welcoming and it encourages exploration. She enjoys sharing her experiences with us and she has become more vocal after joining the school. The teachers are very patient and caring and my child talks about some of the teachers very fondly. Another good thing about the school is the curriculum. The hands on learning is something my daughter enjoys and I am gradually seeing some of the independence that you hear about in the Montessori system.  I am so glad we chose this school for her.

"MindChamps PreSchool @ Holland Village","5","My son has been attending Mindchamps @Holland Village since 18 months old. He became independent very fast in PG class and has since grown happily in the past 2.5 years.

One big thumb up for the school is its teachers. We can tell that the teachers care for the children with love from their hearts. They take care of their eating, napping, toileting, and also teach lessons and build their characters. They are encouraging when the children are hesitant to try new things, yet firm with what they can do and cannot do. They understand the different personalities of the kids and will adjust the teaching methods accordingly. They provide timely and detailed feedback to the parents. Ms. Alina, the principal of the school, is one of the most lovely ladies I have ever seen. She always talks with a smile on her face. Her tone itself is reassuring enough. She supports the children in every possible way that helps them thrive.

Another big thumb up for the school is its curriculum. The curriculum is well-designed with tons of enrichments. For example, the kids have their learning journey every month. My son is so excited to tell us about what he sees outside the school during his learning journeys! Every week, he is looking forward to the music class and gourmet moments. Academically, he is able to read and write simple words and Chinese characters at 4-years old! We do not need to worry about tuition for the transition to primary school, thanks to the rich curriculum at Mindchamps.

Overall, our experience with the school is very pleasant. I will not hesitate to recommend it to my friends.","2024-10-12T00:07:39.590Z","0","Victoria Zhang","1","false",,,"en","10 months ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURudjQ2UUZBEAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURudjQ2UUZBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x37b334c288eade93!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDnv46QFA%7CCgwIy_umuAYQuODbmQI%7C?hl=en","100707693070686277310","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJ3fmYf9f-S7ps8Ppjg3Y3m1MvZ_3U65Wj33Fejtw_Ghzj0Pg=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100707693070686277310?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"MindChamps PreSchool @ Holland Village","5","We enrolled our daughter at MindChamps Preschool when she was 2 years old, and the transformation we've witnessed has been truly remarkable. From the very beginning, we noticed a positive shift in her demeanour, curiosity, and overall development.

MindChamps' holistic approach to early childhood education has played a pivotal role in her growth. The curriculum, designed to foster creativity, critical thinking, and social skills, has provided her with a solid foundation for learning. Through engaging activities like Champs’ Discovery and personalized attention from dedicated teachers, she has blossomed into a confident and inquisitive young learner.

One of the most significant improvements we've observed is in her communication skills. She now expresses herself with clarity and confidence, eagerly sharing her thoughts and ideas with others. Moreover, her problem-solving abilities have greatly enhanced, as she tackles challenges with resilience and determination.

Additionally, we're thrilled to note huge improvement in her Chinese language proficiency. MindChamps' immersive The Love for Chinese Language programme has ignited her interest in Mandarin, and she now converses fluently and comfortably in both English and Mandarin, a skill we know will serve her well in the future.

It's worth mentioning that my elder son also attended MindChamps Preschool from PG to K2, and we saw tremendous improvement in him as well. Witnessing his growth and development during his time at MindChamps was one of the reasons why we chose the same preschool for my daughter. The positive impact it had on my son's academic and personal development gave us confidence in the school's ability to provide an enriching and nurturing environment for my daughter as well.

Moreover, she is a very active child who loves performing. MindChamps has provided her with numerous opportunities to explore her passion for movement and expression through various activities in the Creativity and Theatrical Strategies as well as Neuromooves classes. These experiences have not only allowed her to channel her energy in a positive way but have also contributed to her physical coordination and confidence.

Beyond academic achievements, MindChamps has also nurtured her emotional intelligence and character development. She demonstrates empathy, kindness, and respect towards her peers, embodying the values instilled by the school.

As parents, we couldn't be more delighted with her progress at MindChamps Preschool. It's evident that she’s not only learning, but also thriving in an environment that values her individuality and encourages her to reach full potential. We're grateful to the dedicated teachers and staff who have played a pivotal role in her journey, and we look forward to seeing her continued growth and success in the years to come.

Thank you, MindChamps, for providing our daughter with a nurturing and enriching preschool experience.","2024-06-29T01:57:18.904Z","0","Melissa Loh","6","false",,,"en","Edited a year ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpaVotQUh3EAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpaVotQUh3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x37b334c288eade93!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDiiZ-AHw%7CCgwI_tP9swYQiPmNrwM%7C?hl=en","101960360610806059529","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKZ99AC-pnT_GFBEVF0lIet6sdh_1Lb6EHewAH7deeBgHD6eg=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101960360610806059529?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,"Communication, Quality, Professionalism",,,,,,,,,,,

Strong cohesive culture led by the leadership. The teachers & support staff we’ve interacted with are genuine & caring towards the children.Theres tight communication between parents & school & what I value most is that the school design and based their curriculum and decisions on the child as an individual, building life skills and instilling that curiosity in learning and embracing new experiences.

"The Schoolhouse West Coast","5","After looking at several preschools, we chose The Schoolhouse because we were impressed with them. The principal on our tour was able to concisely explain the educational/developmental goals behind everything at the school, from large-scale aspects of the curriculum to small-scale in-class activities. She could even explain the child developmental reasoning behind why the school purchased certain toys over others. It all seemed so thoughtfully designed.

My daughter started at the youngest level and continued all the way through (until the end of K2). She enjoyed going to school every day and always spoke warmly of her teachers and principal. She never felt stressed there, yet she learned so much that she is at a strong advantage in primary school. The Schoolhouse helped her through many of childhood's challenges with patience and experience, and my daughter and her classmates all grew to become great friends over the years. Her time at The Schoolhouse concluded with a delightful graduation musical that included many well-produced performances by the children and even the teachers.

I am so grateful to The Schoolhouse West Coast for their many positive contributions to my daughter's life.","2024-08-14T18:44:21.544Z","0","Lee M.","4","false",,,"en","Edited a year ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNOdmQ3bHBRRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNOdmQ3bHBRRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x925ba10278994c99!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICNvd7lpQE%7CCgwIhfbztQYQ6JncgwI%7C?hl=en","111826241588056666116","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWc9_f8vfhTgJOzjSogEFW29ClQiA9Qn2gyOv3p8vZEgX2jQm_A=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111826241588056666116?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am impressed by how the staff make the effort to know every child's name and attempt to build rapport with each of them.

My kid is looking forward to school everyday, especially this year when she is in Ms Jermaine and Tian Laoshi’s class. They have definitely helped in creating a healthy culture and environment for her to grow and shine in. Mindchamps program is not only focusing on academic grades achievement, but also building good values and character. It is definitely proven to be a wonderful and rewarding experience when you see the kids eat well, sleep well, play well and learn well at school.","2024-01-25T15:20:17.614Z","0","Kwang Hua Chong","2","false","2024-01-31T08:23:37.000Z","Thank you so much for your support and encouragement! ^_^

We could tell that both teachers love our child and our child trust them as well through the way they interact.

"Invictus International School (Singapore, Bukit Timah Campus)","5","Great job on educating your kids, what your school has done is excellent.

I was at Harbourfront mrt, when my plastic bag decided to give way and crack it resulted in the  entire box of eggs inside cracked, spilling all over the floor of the mrt station.

I managed to get help thanks to so many kind staff around. However, this boy who I later learnt was from invictus Bukit Timah college came up to help me by asking me if I needed help. He later went to the seven eleven store to buy a pack of tissue to help me, although the mess was cleared already, by the Harbourfront staff.

What he does is a testament to the fact that there are good people around in today’s world. And also, relieved some stress off me in an awkward situation.

I send my regards to the school.","2025-01-28T07:04:22.269Z","0","Leebong the dog","9","false","2025-02-03T05:24:16.000Z","Dear Lee,

Students get personalized learning and attention from teachers. Friendly and caring environment in which student can thrive. In terms of learning - they follow the Cambridge International curriculum but also do project based learning where students can work in teams on presentations. Students have regularly homework and school reports are send couple of times to parent among with parent-teachers meetings so parents receive regular feedback on their child`s progress. For PE they go swimming in Tamasek club and also do field sports outside of school. Strongly developed Chinese program as well with very good Chinese teachers. Good variety of co-curricular activities too: sports, drama, art, design, music. Overall a very good school with reasonable fees.","2024-12-19T01:34:15.624Z","0","Bilyana Yaneva","15","true",,,"en","8 months ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR2a296ZkNREAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR2a296ZkNREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x66756a499a86acd6!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDvkozfCQ%7CCgwIl_CNuwYQwK_yqQI%7C?hl=en","116546624562153352131","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIck3R-HJpRTJcDDY2G-CtFdyHPd4YcAhd9JKobMJ7vth8zcVM6=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116546624562153352131?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Matrix Math (Jurong)","5","I am very grateful to Mr. AJ for accepting my lovely son, Jerel into the Matrix Math Jurong Family. Great communication between the parent/child and the center (Mr. AJ and the team). Knowing that I was unwell, the center constantly reminded me of the forthcoming lesson or changes to the lesson time so that Jerel would not miss the lesson as it was a critical year for all P6 students.

Mr. AJ will provide constructive and helpful feedback so that I can make wise decisions. Proposing alternatives / additional learning lessons to improve my son's learning in preparation for the PSLE in 2024.

My son's improvement from getting a constant average grade to getting a satisfactory grade is commendable.  Matrix encouraged Jerel not to give up; nurturing him to continue to maintain/develop an interest in doing Maths. The positive reinforcement does improve his confidence to a certain extent.

As the class size is small, the teacher (Mr. Foo) allows for more individualized attention which benefits my son to fit his learning pace/needs.

Jerel is comfortable with the Home-Matrix distance as it is a straight bus journey taking bus number 180.  Passing by the Jurong East Sports Centre simply brightens up his bus ride for tuition as he is a sports lover.  Convenient and with a coffee shop downstairs, Jerel always looks forward to attending the class followed by his favorite Kolo Mee before heading home.

I have confidence that Matrix will continue to help Jerel to build a solid foundation of knowledge in Maths and he will be able to meet his realistic academic goals.

Once again, thank you Matrix :-)","2024-12-07T05:16:06.472Z","0","Jane JW Tan","7","false","2024-12-17T04:34:31.000Z","Jane, thank you so much for your generous and heartfelt review of Matrix Math Jurong East. Our Centre always has our students/parents welfare at heart and will do our very best to make sure all of us benefit from the experience with Matrix Math. For Jerel and yourself, there is no exception. We worked on/with him through the past year. Its been a pleasure teaching him and Mr Daniel worked hard to bring him up the curve. What made it easier was that Jerel is conscientious, hard-working and checks on his own progress. It did take a while, but through encouragement from both of us, he persevered, improved his stamina and understanding of math concepts, but most of all, built his confidence in tackling Math problem sums. 

We want this brave boy to continue his dream of continuously advancing and from the bottom of our hearts, we are looking forward to him excelling in Secondary Math in the years ahead.","en","8 months ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN2NE9QTGZ3EAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN2NE9QTGZ3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x85c857b5651a0b7a!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICv4OPLfw%7CCgwIlrTPugYQuNy04QE%7C?hl=en","106462552190271563595","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX2nGn4mQMIGN5T7IjOMpPoV9nusTK-ANnU4YNfEMmiqW3_Gshv=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106462552190271563595?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, the environment stood out to me—it’s exceptionally clean, neat, and cozy. Strategy structured for better learning and resting.

Third, I was very impressed by their commitment to teacher quality. The staff are carefully selected, undergo assessments, and receive monthly training. The commitment to teachers quality is something I haven’t seen at many other student care centers.

"MindChamps MindSpace @ Alexandra | After School Student Care for P1-P5","5","I had the privilege of working at this centre as a trainer last year, alongside a wonderful team of staff and Champs. This centre has many strengths — a unique curriculum grounded in the Art of Learning and Champion Mindset, which nurtures each Champ holistically; a clean, welcoming environment with a cosy reading corner; and engaging holiday activities that let Champs explore diverse interests (my experience from last year).

But what truly sets this place apart, in my opinion, is the trainers. I’ve seen firsthand how dedicated and passionate my ex-colleagues are — always going the extra mile to understand and support each Champ. Every child is unique, and they tailor their approaches and strategies to help each Champ. They are not only skilled educators, but also caring mentors. It’s a nurturing space where children feel valued and empowered to learn.

"MindChamps MindSpace @ Alexandra | After School Student Care for P1-P5","5","I enrolled my child here not because of the pedagogy (which honestly is non-evidence-based and essentially mumbo jumbo), but because it is the closest SCC to my place with smaller class size (large part due to high fees). However, no regrets enrolling here at all - it’s been 4 months, and the environment has turned out to be nurturing, and essentially a “home away from home” for my daughter. Trainers update (without me prompting) not only on her academic work, but even whether she has been picky with the food in her lunch bento! Theyre very specific on her areas of improvement as well, for example, what words she gets wrong in spelling and tingxie, what handwriting improvements she still needs to work on. They’re also very accommodating when I need to pick her up in a hurry, getting her ready to leave once I text so we can still make it out within the slim parking grace period at Thye Hong centre. Overall, the small team of trainers have been warm and responsive.","2025-04-26T09:36:11.718Z","0","Shan S","31","true","2025-04-29T03:30:09.000Z","Hi our Champion Parent!

There is never a boring day at MindSpace. Some may think that it is only about Academics but that cannot be more far from what we experienced at MindSpace Alexandra. It is an after school care centre and so much more.

The myriad of activities include outdoor activities such as badminton, table tennis and various physical activities. Our child particularly enjoys the hands on sessions such as art & craft, baking among many other fun and games.

"Odyssey The Global Preschool – Fourth Avenue","5","Both my boys go to Odyssey, one has just graduated, the other is starting his 3rd year soon. Odyssey is a wonderfully nurturing school, with firm but patient and empathetic pedagogues, a compassionate principal with a strong specialist team and warm-hearted non-teaching staff.

My children had a wonderful start to their learning journeys. Their voices were heard, interests and strengths were honed and weaknesses were nurtured. I love the IB system where the children were guided and learnt through exploration and asking questions in a safe environment. Their curiosity and love for learning has been well-established here and will stand them in good stead as they move on.

As a parent, Odyssey Fourth Avenue was the best decision I made for them and I cannot recommend them enough.","2024-11-27T02:10:00.342Z","0","Ling L","5","false",,,"en","9 months ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQN2M3VlVnEAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQN2M3VlVnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x25acfb2d778e7e31!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICP7c7VUg%7CCgwI-P6ZugYQkL-QowE%7C?hl=en","108349122736779493286","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUWZ25NvDwZ54vkR2yOuAO6V2tyNSvXPKQYATGFW4WZ34vPkisU=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108349122736779493286?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"My Little Kingdom Preschool","5","Our daughter has been with My Little Kingdom Hillford for close to 2 years. If she could, she would be the one writing this review and giving her beloved school 10 stars 🤩!

She speaks fondly of her favourite teachers Teacher Chua, Teaching Ying and Guo Lao Shi, and comes home daily with exciting stories about her little community of friends and teachers.

The team here is very dedicated and hands-on, and under the exceptional leadership of principal  Ms Yvonne, who is also a mother herself, maintains a very safe and nurturing environment for the children.

They focus strongly on manners and social skills, and maintain a good rapport with parents, always updating us on our child’s development and wellbeing.

It takes a village to raise a child, and in our case I can’t imagine not having My Little Kingdom as part of my village! We already can’t wait to put our number 2 in MLK when she turns 18 months!

"My Little Kingdom Preschool","5","Dear Ms Yvonne Yeo and Teachers,

After watching the camping footage of my son Enxi and his classmates, may I share with you some of my thoughts.

First and foremost, I would like to say congratulations to you all. it is a very successful camping event. Enxi and his classmates did have fun and learn a lot.  However it is not only a simple excursion or holiday retreat.

As I can see teachers really designed a very meaningful and classical itinerary, from library to food court, from water park to supermarket, which covers almost all important scenes in our life. most importantly, kids were learning and being taught how to be social and emotional beings during this camping. i had never expected Enxi could receive education like this, which could be his most precious childhood or preschool experience and memory.

one more time, let me take this chance to say thank you, ms yvonne' s team, your pedagogical concept is fantastic and successful, your dedications to early childhood education are enormous and laudable! Good job!

In the short time span of merely 5 months, she has created so many core and fond memories of her preschool. She will always come back from school telling us how much fun she had with her teachers and friends. MLK is beyond the traditional school setting where all the children are free to be themselves and is like a second home to many. The holistic and well rounded curriculum helps my girl to pick up languages, social skills, creativity and other skills which is crucial to her development at this age. All the teachers put in their 101% in their lesson plans (be it indoor or outdoor) and more so for bigger events such as sports days, national day celebration and the more recent children’s day. I can never thank Ms Yvonne enough for her vision and perseverance that made MLK a top notch preschool in this area.

The teachers are very patient and loving towards the students. Teacher Chua who has been teaching my girl since the day she enrolled is very caring towards the students. Most teachers/assistant teachers here have been with the school for more than 5 years. Also, the food is prepared in house daily and my kids love the food as well. I have seen great improvement in my younger son ever since he attended My Little Kingdom.
There are also many outdoor activities/events organized by the school to promote school and parents bonding with the kids.

"My Little Kingdom Preschool","5","My 2 children are with MLK for almost a year now. PG and K2.

Just wanted to compliment how dedicated and caring the teachers have been. You can see through their patience and dilligence when interacting with the children. Excellence in pre-schooling comes with resillient teachers who give their heart in nuturing every child. Its not easy but I can see the passion in each and every teacher in class, everyday spurring on the kids.

Education is also top-notched. With MOE syllabus and sufficient homework and knowledge transfer, my K2 has grown so much with her reading.

If you live around the area, MLK is the one and only choice. Rest assured that your child will be very well taken care off.

We’re also glad to hear that the learning experience has been meaningful for your K2 child. Balancing strong academics with nurturing care is what we strive for every day, and we’re so grateful to have families like yours walking this journey with us.

The lunches and tea break served are always nutritious and interesting. I remember my girl wasn’t speaking a word when she first joined at 18mo and falling quite a lot behind her peers. Within a few months she was singing and trying to communicate to us. She is now such a chatterbox!

"My Little Kingdom Preschool","5","I would highly recommend My Little Kingdom (MLK) to anyone who is choosing a pre-school for your little one, especially if you are living in the Jalan Jurong Kechil or West Coast areas.

My son, who is in P1 this year, had the good fortune of attending MLK from toddler class all the way to K2. MLK had just opened its doors opposite where we were staying back in 2017 and we were immediately charmed by its warm, welcoming and positive vibes as well as the skilful and engaging ways in which the principal and teachers interacted with our boy. ❤️

True enough, MLK became a second home to our boy.  Under his teachers’ loving guidance and patient care, as well as the myriad of learning activities that catered to the children’s different talents and dispositions, my son blossomed into a curious, confident and eager learner whom much to our great surprise, transitioned very well into P1 this year.

Thank you MLK for sparing no efforts in nurturing our little (now not so little) one, and doing many many small things with great love. ❤️ Thank you for making such a positive difference to your young charges, and working tirelessly and passionately to create a safe and loving home away from home for them.","2022-03-12T15:54:43.184Z","0","Wee Nee Lee","1","false",,,"en","3 years ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXa0s2Q3dBRRAB","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90BQ22vihWRr9FCcQg3FQVW0iWVfc3zOu3JvHJye901nqbkxZ5InfXXZAR4BQh8WkTTWM_MyNkU0M0ogvcSD625o8Kh08fAHrAaS3w2Ar-zyhUNyNpBhng2JiIwcQIR0502BQHl0",,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXa0s2Q3dBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xb73e8ad1a07e1cfa!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDWkK6CwAE%7CCgsIw4SzkQYQsLeEWA%7C?hl=en","105097151732729061275","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW7MDIM2dXYaOCNr0oVdZJX3zgcYRm2T4wlUibjALUQGm2wVOJK=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105097151732729061275?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I recommend this tuition centre to anyone who wants to see a positive change in their grades and make learning fun once again.","2024-01-12T13:54:13.979Z","0","Aimann","2","false",,,"en","a year ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNOOUludDl3RRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNOOUludDl3RRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x58ea5e9d830e7352!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICN9Int9wE%7CCgwIhYmFrQYQ0P3r0gM%7C?hl=en","103405554977064118909","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKqZaCZNHm6-2wMcrMdJIoQzhJwAdfh_XsDxAuEpb2rYuLMCw=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103405554977064118909?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is not the experience I had with A4 Ms Maureen, whose services I stumbled upon by chance. She is extremely helpful educated me on requirements and legalities as well as sound and practical advices. She took her time over 3 months of communication to find the correct helper for our family. She worked to our timeline and that was very important with a new baby on the way.
She found us the perfect helper for our needs and has always been prompt and supportive of any queries we have had about the process.

This is our first time applying for a FDW mainly taking care of my father. Without any knowledge of the application procedure etc, Ms Teo from A4 with her patience and professionalism, we've managed to secure a helper, Ms Swe Mon from Mynmar. Initially, we were skeptical about how would she performed as she speaks minimal English. However, after going through the care givers training, even the hospital's nurses, occupational therapist and physiotherapist were surprised how competent Swe Mon is. With sigh language and simple English, Swe Mon has been improving on a daily basis. She also does self study of Mandarin and English through her phone during her free time.

Honestly, we felt blessed that we have Swe Mon as she is like an angel sent to us with the professional help of Ms Teo.

Although they may not be the top agencies in Singapore, but A4' s charges are reasonable and I personally would rank them among the best for their CP value, professionalism and attitude.","2024-03-13T01:44:49.926Z","0","Kiok Hiong Thia","16","true",,,"en","a year ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5MkkzbXRRRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5MkkzbXRRRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x8fd5bc6b19294e14!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgID92I3mtQE%7CCgwIkYrErwYQiMn8uQM%7C?hl=en","112863836259782840544","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKX_iUOLd0Q9uaOOf_8999Vlf81QlDa4beRjTG6Y0yu9Ceg1A=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112863836259782840544?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Aunty SG - Confinement Nannies and Babysitting Services","5","We’re so grateful to have had Aunty Cindy as our confinement nanny. Our baby arrived several weeks early, and she kindly adjusted her schedule to be with us from the day we came home from the hospital.

She’s a wonderful cook who prepared delicious meals tailored to my recovery and adapted to our family’s preferences. With her around, everyone was well-fed.

Aunty Cindy was also great with our senior dog — it’s rare to find an English-speaking nanny comfortable in a household with pets, and we’re so thankful for that. She was lovely with my parents too, which we really appreciated.

As a seasoned nanny, she cared for our baby with so much patience, adjusting to her specific needs (like syringe feeding) and soothing her when fussy. She also guided my husband and me through newborn care — focusing first on my recovery, then gradually teaching us so we’d feel confident when she left. We would have had a much harder time learning to be new parents without her support.

Overall, we’ve learned so much in these 4 weeks and are thankful to have started our parenting journey with Aunty Cindy. Highly recommend her!

Really appreciated all the baby care tips too.

"Aunty SG - Confinement Nannies and Babysitting Services","5","FTM here - I didn’t have the best experience with my first nanny after my emergency C-section. For the 17 days she was with us, I barely got any rest and had to deal with and put up with several issues. When she had a medical emergency and had to leave, I decided to go without a nanny, but given unforeseen circumstances, I ended up arranging a replacement.

The team at Aunty Confinement were immensely understanding and quick to help with any questions or concerns I had. A special shoutout to Jaslene and Snow for helping to get a replacement sorted so quickly.

I was then introduced to Aunty Maggie Teoh (pictured), who truly became a lifesaver. In just 11 days, she helped me rest and gave me the confidence to handle my baby and breastfeeding/pumping journey without guilt. Maggie is proactive, patient, and always ready to share her experience. She also made sure I had delicious, nutritious meals while training me and my baby to manage feedings and time between feedings more efficiently. We are so grateful and highly recommend her if you’re lucky enough to get a spot - as I understand she’s currently booked through to next year!

Thank you Aunty Confinement and Aunty Maggie ❤️","2025-08-08T07:48:28.453Z","0","C Soh","54","true","2025-08-11T00:50:09.000Z","Thank you so much for sharing your experience with us.

"Aunty SG - Confinement Nannies and Babysitting Services","5","As a first-time mum with absolutely no clue how to take care of a newborn (or myself postpartum), I’m so grateful we had Aunty Yoke Yong with us during our confinement. She stayed with us for 28 days and taught me everything I needed to know from baby care, breastfeeding tips, to how to care for my own recovery.

She cooked delicious and nutritious meals for me every day, always checking in to make sure I was eating well and resting enough. She was patient, kind, and so experienced.  I really felt like I was in good hands.

Before she left, she even helped us prepare for our baby boy’s full month celebration. It was such a bittersweet moment when she left.  I was really sad to see her go, but felt much more confident and ready to take care of the baby because of her.

Even after confinement, we still keep in touch and she’s always ready to help if we have questions. We’re really lucky to have had her, highly recommended to any new parents looking for a dedicated and knowledgeable confinement nanny. ❤️","2025-07-24T14:22:13.641Z","0","Jasmin","2","false","2025-07-25T02:09:22.000Z","Thank you so much for your heartfelt review and for sharing your experience as a first-time mum.

Our daughter was able to join the school in just two days from the registration, and we would like to thank Ms. Chen, Ms. Anne, and the rest of the school staff for their care and kindness towards our child during her first week. :)

"First Steps Preschool @ Jurong","5","First steps Jurong- previously called Kids Mansion is an excellent place to enroll your children.

My older daughter and her cousins, alongside with our friends' children were all enrolled to the childcare centre since PG and they have since graduated.

My younger son is currently in the childcare centre and loves attending school. He doesn't have reluctance to go to school every morning and he often shares his joy at school with us.

The teachers are warmth and helpful. Especially teachers like Teacher Zann, Diana, Ying jie, Doris, Anna,the Chinese teachers and many others.

They have a structural approach where by the same teachers takes the same year of students every year and we can witness the growth of our children in terms of behaviour and discipline

Some teachers will spend some time talking to you about the children's performance when you pick your children up from school.

They have a yearly concert for the past few years that was self designed, self choreographed by the teachers themselves and it was for all levels. This is a very good platform for children to showcase their learning to their parents. The level of performance is amazing.

I am also very elated to see how they handle students with special needs. We hear of very good feedback on this area too

The school was previously taken over by another owner and we could feel the difference in the environment. We were hesitant to continue our son in the school.

However, we are all elated and happy to hear that Benny is taking over the school once again. Benny is one very passionate principal who is actively involved in the school' daily activities.

We are confident that with his leadership once again, the school will be an awesome childcare once again!

If you want a centre that uses not just hard skills, but soft skills and also teachers who teaches with the heart, try this centre!

We highly recommend any parent to have a non obligatory chat with Principal Benny if you are keen.

Cheers!!!","2024-07-19T08:27:31.785Z","0","Sumiko Tan","7","false",,,"en","a year ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURyN1p2Vm1RRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURyN1p2Vm1RRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x3d419c1d02305bb7!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDr7ZvVmQE%7CCgwI88botAYQ6L7E9gI%7C?hl=en","115593574761218974278","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXFabrVgb2oFmKWgKSOyq4Vbo4AnCmlJm4ZzVo2fVaOR7bMZxO7=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115593574761218974278?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Science Studios Learning Centre - Bukit Timah Plaza","5","Science Studios is an extremely awesome tuition centre as the notes are very useful and the teachers there are very kind, helpful and patient. I have a really great time going to Science Studios and have always been looking forward to every lesson as they always have hands-on experiments and quizzes(Kahoot!) which are very fun and exciting. These helped me to understand the topic more and understanding it while having fun, giving me more interest in Science which made me feel more enthusiastic about learning a new topic. There would be quizzes at the end of every lesson and practice papers by Science Studios when exams are near. The teachers will always help me if I have any queries and will always stop to explain if someone doesn’t understand. They will also give you some small token of encouragement if you submit your homework promptly. My Science was really poor in P3 (at AL5) and with Science Studios’ help in P4, my grades improved and I got AL2 for PSLE!
Thank you Science Studios for blessing me with a strong foundation for Science.😁

Thank you for your feedback.
I’m sorry to hear that the amount of content did not meet your expectations. There are 4 components to the online lesson. Each component actually costs less than $4.
The science online resources are meant as a form of targeted summary revision for students after they have completed the lessons in their schools. They could also be an introduction to the topic. We have gotten feedback from many parents and students that have found the lessons useful in the above-mentioned aspects. These online lessons are not designed to replace the many hours of science lessons in school. We have separately emailed you.","en","4 years ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTcmNHaVJREAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURTcmNHaVJREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x5b4dd9e752ece0c8!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDSrcGiRQ%7CCgsIkLPP_wUQyPvJfg%7C?hl=en","115241262128427594145","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXPGIz9gLSfFZ--Vb-yyZxLl26yG0zd9WaL0K3l0jKR8O_Ou3jl=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115241262128427594145?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Green Pastures Child Centre","5","We transferred our eldest daughter to Green Pastures Preschool for K2, and we were amazed at her transformation. When she started, she could barely recognize simple words and struggled with vocabulary compared to her peers. But thanks to the experienced, dedicated teachers, within just a year, she was reading and writing so well—we were absolutely amazed!

When our second child joined Green Pastures, we had to move her to a different preschool after we shifted house. However, we quickly noticed she was way ahead of her classmates, bored, and not learning much. The food also was terrible compared to Green Pastures’ delicious meals! So, within months, we transferred her back—and she’s now thriving, loving her lessons, enjoying the food, and very happy every day.

What I really like about Green Pastures:
‐Stable, experienced teachers who truly know each child (unlike other preschools with constant teacher changes).
-A large, safe outdoor playground
-Engaging year-end performances that build confidence and showcase their learning.
-Strong Christian values woven into daily lessons—something we deeply appreciate.
-easy communication with teachers and principal, frequent updates of photos and videos of their activities

After experiencing other preschools with our first two kids, we didn’t hesitate to enroll our third at Green Pastures.

"Green Pastures Child Centre","5","One of the best childcare center along Farrer Road. They offer a well-rounded curriculum that includes age-appropriate learning through play, early literacy activities, arts and crafts, and outdoor exploration. The variety keeps the children engaged and excited to go to the center every day.

The facilities are clean and thoughtfully designed for young children. There are plenty of safe indoor and outdoor play areas, and the classrooms are bright, welcoming, and filled with stimulating educational materials.

But what really sets the center apart is the staff. The principal, teachers and caregivers are incredibly warm, patient, and attentive. They clearly care about the children and take the time to understand each child's unique needs and personality. Communication is excellent—they regularly update me on my child's progress, daily activities, and any concerns.

"Green Pastures Child Centre","5","This is a wonderful kindergarten that will see your child through from 18 months to kindergarten 2.

I am a mother of 5 and my 3 younger children attended Green Pastures. I have had the blessing of being a parent of Green Pastures for over the past 7 years. I've had other experiences with preschools in the neighborhood and in my opinion GP has been the best.

GP will bring your children up with LOVE and they are committed to imparting the right VALUES in them. Which is really all that these little ones need at this point in their lives. GP teachers tend to follow their class group from N1 to K2 which means the children do not have the stress of acclimatising to a new personality every year. This is something our family continues to cherish about this school.  This has provided our children with the sense of family within the school which has contributed to filling them with a deep sense of stability and the confidence to build strong relationships later on in primary school. Growing our children up in love and stability has become an underrated feature of our early education and this is what Green Pastures does best.

If you ever get to visit the school, you will be greeted by a warm red brick house and a beautiful playground set under the loving boughs of one of the oldest rain trees in Singapore. In the same way that this ancient sage tree is home and hearth to many tropical ferns, vines, squirrels, woodpeckers and other wonderful avian visitors - GP has provided my family with deep roots in love and my children the opportunity to use this support to go on to grow their own communities.","2025-05-16T02:05:22.383Z","0","Melissa Lim","8","false",,,"en","3 months ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VOeVZ5dnVMbUstamlBRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VOeVZ5dnVMbUstamlBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x385a1b3c1f965de1!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKENyVyvuLmK-jiAE%7CCgwI4rqawQYQ8LP3tgE%7C?hl=en","114427999569143269862","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocI9Fjol0wlrjKWxyHvHxF2plfiWxlBPPO_r3FNUVh07Y0RhMw=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114427999569143269862?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The teachers will also give feedback to the parents in a timely manner. When I go to pick up my children, the teachers will chat with me for a few words, so I feel relieved. Both of my children studied at the playground until graduation. When the eldest was studying, we lived in Bukit Batok, and we picked them up and dropped them off every day. The teachers followed them from the playground until graduation. Unless there were special circumstances, they would not change teachers and knew the students well. The teacher turnover is low. Many teachers have been working for more than ten years, and even the principal has been working for 40 years, which is very rare in Singapore. I still keep in touch with the teachers, and this feeling is very good 👍 I have recommended it to many friends around me, and they all say that it is super cost-effective.","en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My boy is usually shy in school and thus may not have much opportunity to clarify questions in a big classroom setting.

When his exams are near, Ms Aimi even puts in extra time in catching up with his corrections and focus on his weak areas. For his year end exam, his grade turned out to be above our expectation.

The first time I visited the school, I liked the school's atmosphere; the classroom was clean, colorful, and well-ventilated. I was also pleasantly surprised by how endearing the kids were. It spoke volumes about the nurturing and supportive environment they experience in class. My son cries a lot every time he has to go to school (he attended 2 preschools before). So I was glad at how easily he adjusted to Eshkol Valley. I am so grateful to the Principal and teachers who created a fun and engaging learning environment for him. Each day, he eagerly looks forward to going to school, and as parents, we couldn't be happier with his experience.","2023-07-01T21:43:36.159Z","0","Marienne Ramos","9","false",,,"en","2 years ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKMWNYdUdBEAE","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90Cf3CZtbwjxxBhGjHlgxJvsWns6qwTet2FRPUV4NobvW_RISQOVBYvWsrnFeqpnitwMQCRMiukeR7x84pjWnYQhEdtBsDE0hfzgMhTjmSe25dH99ezkn8cD1bY8Wcy-hZBlGfm9Gg",,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKMWNYdUdBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x4da1aee451e63cb7!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICJ1cXuGA%7CCgsIiLyCpQYQgKGLTA%7C?hl=en","107582435923926888627","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLHuxeSaO81NXXB--ZXbgszoh73jOkjiCiJIp40Wx4D6DJnTg=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107582435923926888627?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Eshkol Valley @ Sengkang Pearl Pte Ltd","5","My daughter 4yo and my son 2yo have been with Eshkol Valley since their PG age from 18mo. I have so much comfort from the teacher as anxious parent on how my daughter will adapt being separated from me to start her first day. The first 2 weeks was tough, my daughter would cry and throw out due to crying but teachers and the aunties there were so assuring and told me it’s okay and it’s normal. They are so patient to say it’s okay to needing to change her daily and mop the mess my daughter created due to all her crying.

The daily updates from principal/teacher via WhatsApp (now they have school communicate and photo sharing App) on how my daughter are doing for the first two weeks helped me to have a peace of mind and assurance. My daughter adapted and less crying very quicker than I imagined it would be.

She have learned so much in speech, identifying, socialising, writing, trying to read words, etc in English and even improved so much in her Mandarin.

My spouse and I seen how our daughter grew to become so independent and the things she learnt there are really broad and sometime in our opinion deep for her age, example identifying all the planets and remembers them, saying all the shapes include ‘rhombus shape’. etc. We too have our son joined the sister and seen him grew in fast pace especially in speech.

My son went through a tough 1 week of separation anxiety too but very comfortably adapted to it after and love going to school. Seeing him so comfortably walking in as if he entered his second home felt very comforting.

I love how the curriculum involve parents and children time to accomplish a task. It helps us to bond with our kids and also create meaningful moments and conversation around doing homecraft together.

All the teachers are so dedicated. Their love and care for the children can be seen on how they update you about your children. I remember indicating I wish my daughter to improve in her mandarin speaking in the next term during one of our parent-teacher meet, I saw progress of my daughter really improve in making initiative to speak in mandarin and identifying mandarin words.

Both my children love their teachers so much! Can see my daughter excitement everytime she talks about her teachers and about her day at school. And my son so happy and cheerful to see his favourite teacher at the door so welcoming. It is so heartwarming watch they enjoy school and know that they are in safe environment and are in good caring hands.

All in all, I would definitely recommend friends and families who are planning to send their child to school for the first time here. Both my children built a strong learning foundation here.","2023-05-31T09:35:24.100Z","0","Vivian Jong","12","true",,,"en","2 years ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR4OEoyemlnRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR4OEoyemlnRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x4da1aee451e63cb7!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDx8J2zigE%7CCgsI3KncowYQ2NHkLw%7C?hl=en","103122415893396727201","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVpUtcIA8ygyb1Tnaf_SH4ZkxDAn1neb47pahmMBm3nbVFY_OPS=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103122415893396727201?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Eshkol Valley @ Sengkang Pearl Pte Ltd","5","4 years is a long time for a 6yo! That’s how long My girl has been spending most of her life fruitfully thus far! While many focus only on the so call pedagogy and brand, few actually experience the fruits and returns from the most established of the brood.

EV@sengkang pearl is a rare gem that stands out among the lot. When we first moved to the neighbourhood, like most parents, the hunt for a preschool ( or rather, nightmare) begun. We were either put off or turned away by the overpopulated preschools in the northeast region and the journey was disappointing, to say the least.

But as if guided by divine direction, we stumbled upon the “land flowing with milk and honey”, or Eshkol Valley in the bible (confessedly, I missed that in my own bible studies..). I must say that the first tour-around experience was the best, not becoz of over-promising or any dazzling opulence to the exterior, but the sincerity, warmth and now well behaved the kids were! Definitely sending!

In the four years, I saw how my girl with some speech delays initially overcame her challenges and is now able to read Roald Dahl, Enid blyton!the improvement is stellar.

Like many, her Chinese was atrocious but the patience and high standards of coaching has prepared my girl for the rigor of P1 higher Chinese!

On top of that, she has gained confidence from being a quiet and shy little one to quite a “performer” and story teller!

Values impartation is the next most imp thing that EV has gifted  my girl. The teaching cohort in the school holds on to strong moral values and expect the same of the children as they guide them to make the right decisions and differentiating right from wrong, yet being kind and patient towards those who err.

4 years has gone by in a twinkling of our eyes, and now it is time to bid fond farewell. Knowing that she is graduating, she has refused to even miss a day of school. Farewell, her first teachers school and friends!","2021-11-18T03:57:18.393Z","0","Addyjean Khoo","10","true",,,"en","3 years ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHLVBuM1VREAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHLVBuM1VREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x4da1aee451e63cb7!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDG-Pn3UQ%7CCgwInp7XjAYQ4J7VuwE%7C?hl=en","104761994791020452486","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJusCSAEGxPT_hGG5Z2wvKkoyi9Sy_wGrn9FQZUrIEgzuYhRA=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104761994791020452486?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,"Communication, Quality, Professionalism, Value",,,,,,,,,,,

When I 1st visited the school, the principal, teachers and the environment are so warm and comfortable to be in, unlike the 1st preschool I sent my son to. He enjoyed going to school everyday to meet his teachers and friends.  I can also see progress in him within a few months. The teachers are so dedicated and loving to the children. Even though he has graduated, the teachers still remember him when they see him. Now my girl is currently schooling there, she look forward to attend school daily and telling me about her teachers and friends when she gets home. I can see the principal and teachers has put in a lot of effort for every festival, every events held and the progress in the learning journey over these few years. Kudos to all the teachers for giving the kids a wonderful preschool experience.","2021-05-07T10:09:39.750Z","0","Pamela Lee","5","false",,,"en","4 years ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLeXRucm9BRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLeXRucm9BRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x4da1aee451e63cb7!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDKytnroAE%7CCgwI46PUhAYQgMD05QI%7C?hl=en","105334098969630528259","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLGTpgCi_obXZWZRB5xQ0LP3Ut-EVZ4YyNd0a--4n4eBhZldQ=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105334098969630528259?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,"Communication, Quality, Professionalism, Value",,,,,,,,,,,

"Eshkol Valley @ Sengkang Pearl Pte Ltd","5","My daughter has been studying here for close to 2 years and I have seen a positive change in her. She used to be very shy and reserved in her previous preschool but we can see that she is slowly opening up and becoming more expressive and confident here at Eshkol Valley. Her reading and writing have shown improvements too. Teachers here are loving and dedicated. You can tell that they have a heart for children. Really appreciate her teachers for encouraging her to get out of her comfort zone (prompting her to share more during class discussions, trying out new food, assigning her to be class leader of the day, picking up self-help skills, etc). My girl always come home to share all the fun things she did in school. Facilities may not be the best but we really love the warm and friendly atmosphere here.

"PEM Confinement Nanny Agency Pte Ltd","5","It has been a wonderful 28 days with our nanny (#1623 Soo Saw Tin 苏素珍), who has taken great care not just of our baby, but also of me, my husband, and our home. She is very experienced, responsible, and meticulous. She never fails to wake up in the middle of the night to feed my baby whenever the baby stirs, and I have never once seen her sleepy or distracted on her phone. I can truly see that she sincerely and genuinely cares for our little one.

She treated our baby like her own — singing to her, playing with her, and always keeping a close eye on her needs. For the first two weeks, she patiently used a syringe to feed my baby because she was concerned the baby might not want to latch. She also patiently taught us how to take care of our baby, which gave us so much confidence as new parents.

Every dish of her cooking is delicious! She is very knowledgeable about confinement food, always mindful of what I can and cannot eat, and even makes the effort to ask my husband to buy ingredients that I enjoy.

She strikes a nice balance in her interactions — not overly talkative, but always cheerful and pleasant to chat with, which I really appreciate. She also keeps my kitchen spotless; I’ve honestly never seen it so neat and organised before. She even insists that I don’t wash anything in the sink so that I won’t develop hand pain.

All in all, I would highly recommend her to any family. If I have a second child, I will definitely want her back again. 🥰❤️","2025-08-28T04:35:25.080Z","0","Felicia Mah","5","false",,,"en","4 hours ago",,"Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2s4NGFYSkdXbUZ5VjA5U1EzcFhaMTl1VURselptYxAB","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90ADndpClELImKg96dhNrLoH4I3dhiqJbbMmDtrMSxWVQW64YlJPqLMqkU385dyHB1rZaFEAxCe4X06kvESjrIU62976g1B923IjJm8_1e2lpfAfPlNO421DeEKufyALYE2xR7GHpzhWcR8e","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90DeBjf3O9mlzGBVmKTdIiMEvz4f1I6lINtj7DlZLYVOW9o7ZuIysqfURDnGcggkfV5YItfXV-Ra4SIywaKrveuEN_mJPXZrpDyHm3RBWKc-HS-tDnBYXiInK7XGPF75Z2xbbndOCbO4bBJl","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90CbEbWCDI2AgJOtJI6AUt2kEF4YK-zQ7hiK7GXYPhXuvuuhYARa62MhTJXsAXW1kBc5fYkZDeQEkoQdBkj8Fs4LWoz5oa94SrRxUptUNPWtE1apzcGU90UOCp99E6-HIJXHJ7NxHTnQzLkZ","Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sCi9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2s4NGFYSkdXbUZ5VjA5U1EzcFhaMTl1VURselptYxAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x9676a0ccc259662f!3m1!1s2@1:CAIQACodChtycF9oOk84aXJGWmFyV09SQ3pXZ19uUDlzZmc%7C0cfxmC3o3ZE%7C?hl=en","103847603869506889004","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKTGnDZPeJ6jXEBZG9nEQADcAMyoiZ6oBloKaxgqm2Sii2ilg=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103847603869506889004?hl=en",,,,"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90DxOtQIB3IuPjL8NFIRf4N5QvZ4qJXjKQZBk__t0IxcfIsuhAD1uOx0rwfV228Pg-YE7sJBqfn3uTJhKlcLNH3mIgd1IpVAXxGBebZopRuc4AH5AJ1hZNv8ZcDfGzIvTvm32Yp7hPrDUl0H","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90B6qEPnog2kUN0_BE015tIVX-32zUCbF-j3WHyPBsHo0dFukxFQN3FOqqDcpz9jicy4rmMM5ja_UCWTvasJpiexSTiEnsp3sQ5_W3870zWo68YyeURZGbV875R5nvYvpYqtCVYn08ZaN6CF","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90ChNi3cxHEitLGHMkSoRVmN8DmsqsDWTiw5o-akcaZPLdtgcH_rAfd8YW9iHCgFf0uZn2Wi4bHGZTcgt_Tzb_uLxbTMhMV-7ydOe-JQuRSXSqtkIUKZU36oymCdayI-tpYDea6Qleb1ykNm","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90CwdEkM4R5BkMMeMMpojumQJzUpC353IBH0AHol3pGYgtgAQvhIWooYkiLkIVcdjGiMRYLbn8a5dGQGOHWpxNupV1DNA1IZVeb76_nX2LSkkqw_LDO2Wj0npDinWY_1KPVndaHgbM-BBmS9","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90D-NBgitZhTcr77Ve7NUG4HWpml4eEdqXdvzhPR41zN1lRC4NovDhzy_SmEyRy-FomkMdFUXt2y8oPK79g7Or5k0ZiFdi1VHwbbOYQohXyTy_T_YeVRklaYWAj-VqOtjjXEcySVEGBmC90E","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90BB_sfym7jO1CrK5tcDTxzTPxRDiBU4Othk51MaOuWDlrhYLygu9qT1vxNXrqzoTidjkCWE_pGyoMa_ERmd3KV2vC7rgVgoAcemzyW7cDelZsue19m8eLcszRllgUkkKUIGQRhKB2Cx6v11","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90DQn_-m6MHR6plYB-SFSgTp6yC6hPdBrO0C-b-sC62Yy7BeK8Bu9JjUIf1o-X8zrXel3hCuDvThxT6NjkNZtuYRhTEx8t-Y07bLBbOSAQXcms6-3pP6Cs7Ff0Hx1iuoSYOqYnP3s82HjLOs","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90DW0g84UG0MmlwS-SXZmCcv-ghDar-6U28l4gTSVwrkkvmdMWdPYA5eMp39zeII_fEPbOWb5TFGTsEaM_AsBzJwpTVYWKga0sbPPtpLxnF__m-PlsqLbr6ZaE6aZ1Xl-jDEkOk8fh8tm-CF",,,,,,,,,,,,
"PEM Confinement Nanny Agency Pte Ltd","5","It has truly been one of the greatest blessings for our family to have Aunty Koh Ah Poh  许亜保 (#2328) as our confinement nanny. From the very first day, she made us feel at ease and gave us the comfort and assurance that both our baby and I were in the best hands.

Her love, patience, and skill in caring for our little one were evident in everything she did. Whether it was changing diapers, giving baths, cleaning up after the baby, or soothing him gently to sleep, she approached every task with so much attentiveness and confidence. Watching her care for our baby not only brought us peace of mind but also taught us so much about how to handle those delicate newborn moments with calmness and love.

Beyond caring for the baby, Aunty Ah Poh also poured her heart into caring for me. Every meal she prepared was filled with thoughtfulness, delicious, nutritious, and always tailored to my personal preferences and recovery needs. It wasn’t just food. It felt like she was nourishing me with kindness.

What touched us most was how she always went above and beyond her responsibilities. Without needing to be asked, she kept our home neat, clean, and organized, creating such a comfortable and stress free environment for us to focus on bonding with our baby. She was never intrusive, always respectful of our choices and preferences, and gently guided us with patience as we learned to care for our little one ourselves. Her encouragement gave us confidence as new parents.

Throughout her stay, we could truly feel the genuine love and dedication she put into everything she did. It wasn’t just a job for her. She cared for our family with her whole heart, and that made all the difference during this precious but challenging time.

We are so grateful for Aunty Ah Poh’s presence in our home. She has left us with not only wonderful memories but also invaluable knowledge and habits that will stay with us long after her time with us. Thank you, Aunty Ah Poh, for your kindness, your patience, and your heartfelt care and love. You will always have a special place in our hearts.","2025-08-28T03:46:01.446Z","0","Injune Ng","7","false",,,"en","5 hours ago",,"Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tsWVlXODVTa0p3VW1aSGMwRlROVnBTWjBseVZXYxAB","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90Bo6hffqgyvYT2eZPIC0JmH3PIeAp9V2E7pWA8Ry2mpT8OieWKGyFKeCEKI3906VZGXKpRYjELMZHJ9X9Y6kJHr38ehYa9IjRrmjgqgV3YA6OvMghWIfOUd9AqwCIKZmcB621IpCYyvqM8m","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90BrXhwifwbw_JN2pGFGyQVvFbtMF8oYkQFuyfJnVXzUSFCw9ZBkdmcz8tx_krly3icn9vnGFA5plMPTU87RKQvv-jXQb6_GTrjyoPGsd3AXlX6ReOfrjOQLkiTUAbEDsuvVntsdhOndq_P0",,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sCi9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tsWVlXODVTa0p3VW1aSGMwRlROVnBTWjBseVZXYxAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x9676a0ccc259662f!3m1!1s2@1:CAIQACodChtycF9oOklYYW85SkJwUmZHc0FTNVpSZ0lyVWc%7C0cfx2tPcL09%7C?hl=en","117749361030792723601","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVwWwyI3xOtQO5x0xjZ20j8tif31DPR9xf8AdMlhgn8AJmVrcxm=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117749361030792723601?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"PEM Confinement Nanny Agency Pte Ltd","5","We have been very fortunate to have had Gold Nanny Auntie Lemon (#2150) with us in the past month, taking care of both baby and myself. From the moment she arrived, we were impressed by her professionalism and organization skills.

My priority has always been caring for baby, and on this front she has been excellent. She is hygienic and clean, washing her hands often when handling my baby. Having had a few nannies in the past, I also find her  gentle and careful when handling my baby. Auntie Lemon has also laid the foundations for good, practical sleeping routine (getting baby used to sleeping with background chatter, not picking up baby unnecessarily), which I very much appreciate as a mother of 2 other young (and noisy) kids. Beyond that she’s worked tirelessly to care for baby and ensure that I get enough rest.

Her cooking is also tasty and she makes it a point to tailor it to my preferences. She’s able to cook a variety of delicious and nourishing food, and even found time to bake a chiffon cake for us!

Auntie Lemon is also warm and easy-going, which has made the experience all the more enjoyable. She got along well with my helper, and even my very wary toddler has grown fond of her during this time.

I highly recommend Auntie Lemon if you’re looking for a dedicated, loving, and skilled nanny. She has made my confinement such a positive and easy one, and I’m very grateful for her support.","2025-08-28T02:26:24.118Z","0","Amanda Choo","2","false",,,"en","6 hours ago",,"Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tkVVlTMXJlWFZ4YjAxTWMzWTFWa3hpY1d4VmNVRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sCi9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tkVVlTMXJlWFZ4YjAxTWMzWTFWa3hpY1d4VmNVRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x9676a0ccc259662f!3m1!1s2@1:CAIQACodChtycF9oOkdUYS1reXVxb01Mc3Y1VkxicWxVcUE%7C0cfvtF63KLC%7C?hl=en","103690339168391264952","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKr2vUMCacZtkv81_NbnbutIfeyHZOG-_CmXrOrMNhwkMxxIA=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103690339168391264952?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She is meticulous and has high standard of hygiene, whether is it cooking or baby care.

She is a knowledgeable nanny that saved me and my husband’s life! We were so lost at all the advise on how to take care of our baby but after knowing our baby has colic and silent reflux we know what caused her inconsolable crying for hours in a day. Peng Jie advised to give ruyi oil, massages, exercises, gripe water, ridwind as she sees our baby bloated (which as a first time parents we have no idea of). Peng Jie was so patient with our baby, carrying her and coaxing her until baby finally falls asleep. She then slowly took care of our baby and we could see that our baby fussiness is slowly going away, no more bloating and no more endless crying episodes. Seriously God send 🙏🏻 thank you so much for helping us out, we will not hesitate to hire Peng Jie again should we have our second born!

We didn’t try her cooking due to our super fussy baby, we just tell her to focus on coaxing her and caring for her instead. And since it’s also my 2nd month I don’t really need the confinement food anymore haha.

From the very first day, she showed so much patience, care, and calmness that gave me great reassurance as a new mother. She took wonderful care of my baby, handling every need with such attentiveness and love, which allowed me to rest and focus on my recovery without worry.

Her knowledge and experience in both baby care and postpartum recovery were truly invaluable. She guided me gently through many things I was unsure about, always explaining patiently. I deeply appreciate how supportive she was during my confinement, not only in caring for the baby but also in caring for me as a mother.

On top of all that, her cooking was delicious, healthy, and nourishing—every meal felt like it was prepared with love and truly helped me regain strength day by day.

I am sincerely grateful for all her help during this precious period. Having her by my side made my confinement a smooth, positive, and memorable experience.

"PEM Confinement Nanny Agency Pte Ltd","5","This is my second time engaging Chia Yeau Lee (#1766) as my confinement nanny. She was also the nanny for my first baby, and we like her so much that she was my first choice again for my second baby!

She is very experienced in caring for newborns — from feeding and bathing to soothing and putting them to sleep. As parents, we felt completely confident leaving our babies in her care because she is reliable, attentive, and considerate towards both the baby and myself.

I encountered some challenges with breastfeeding, and she kindly shared useful tips and encouraged me to drink more nourishing soups and red date tea. My baby often wakes up at night, but she patiently feeds him and gently rocks him back to sleep. She takes care of my baby very well so that I can sleep through the night!

When it comes to cooking, she is proactive in checking our food preferences and adjusting the seasoning and ingredients accordingly. She has a great sense of nutrition, often combining a variety of colorful ingredients into delicious and healthy dishes. We love her cooking style, and even my mom was impressed by her dishes when she came to visit!

On top of her skills, she is easy-going, empathetic, and has a big heart — which makes the confinement period not only smooth but also pleasant.

Overall, I’m truly grateful for her care and support during this important time. Thanks to her efforts, I was able to recover well postpartum while she lovingly cared for my newborn.

"PEM Confinement Nanny Agency Pte Ltd","5","As a first-time parents with no help, it is really advisable to engage for a confinement nanny to help taking care of the baby and also around the house. The mother can rest well, and the father would not need to worry too much to return to work.

Our Nanny #1810 Loo Yoke Chin has been a great help. She is a well experienced nanny able to know what to do in all situation, care for our baby a lot and teaches us a lot too. Our baby discharge from hospital with jaundice and requires to visit the clinic every other day, she has been helping and bringing the baby to the clinic for the review, following a schedule to ensure that baby feeds well, poo and pee well to lower the jaundice level. Baby is also very gassy and quite colic, loves to be carried to sleep due to the upset stomach sometimes, nanny has been carrying the baby every night when baby is fussy to soothe baby to sleep before letting baby down to sleep on the cot. Boiling water to help with bathing the baby and especially clearing up our baby’s rash on the face. Attends to baby even though she is working on something else when baby is in need.

She also takes care of the mother well to ensure mother is well rested, eat well and drink well. Cooking and making dessert for me because breastfeeding really makes you hungry. She helped with tidying up and ensuring the house is clean and tidy as well. Hand washing all our baby’s clothing and laundry to ensure they are clean. She has also been teaching us all the tips and ways to take care of a baby during these periods and also share what to look out for in the future as well.

"PEM Confinement Nanny Agency Pte Ltd","5","We feel really fortunate to have been assigned Jenni jie (#2147 - under gold nanny) as our confinement nanny. As first time parents, everything felt new and overwhelming at the beginning but Jenni’s calm and encouraging nature made such a difference. She guided us step by step on how to care for our baby, never once making us feel inadequate and always reminding us not to give up.

On top of her nurturing care, she is also an amazing cook! Every meal was delicious and thoughtfully prepared. Once she noticed the dishes we enjoyed, she would go the extra mile to recreate them and satisfy our cravings. She also prepared nutritious meals to support mummy’s recovery especially during confinement period and boost milk supply and even ensured herbal bath water was ready everyday.

Most of all, we’re especially grateful for the way she cared for our baby both day and night, allowing us to get much needed rest during this period. Knowing our little one was in her capable hands gave us so much peace of mind.

Jenni truly lives up to the name of a “Gold Nanny”! She’s caring, professional and wholehearted in everything she does. We couldn’t have asked for a better nanny to accompany us through this important phase of our lives.

"PEM Confinement Nanny Agency Pte Ltd","5","We were incredibly fortunate to have #1772 Aunt Liew Yin Ching as our confinement nanny. From day one, she impressed us with her deep experience, professionalism, and genuine care for both our baby and myself as a new mother.

She is exceptionally skilled with newborn care—gentle, patient, and very knowledgeable. She helped us establish a good routine for the baby and always made sure we felt supported and confident, especially as first-time parents. We truly appreciated her calm presence and ability to handle every situation with ease.

Her cooking was another highlight. Every meal was nutritious, delicious, and thoughtfully prepared to support recovery and enhance milk supply. She always ensured there was variety, and we looked forward to every dish.

One thing we especially appreciated was how she helped us capture special moments by taking photos of our baby. It was such a kind and meaningful gesture, and now we have so many beautiful memories to look back on—something we’ll always treasure.

Beyond her skills, Aunt Liew was respectful of our home, always tidy and organized, and brought a warm, positive energy into our household.

We highly recommend her to any family looking for a capable, caring, and truly experienced confinement nanny. She made our confinement period smooth, restful, and full of lovely memories.","2025-08-24T05:41:52.316Z","0","vanessa koh","15","true","2025-08-28T08:50:53.000Z","Dear vanessa koh, thank you very much for trusting, supporting and choosing our service.

"PEM Confinement Nanny Agency Pte Ltd","5","Esther Tey Bee Hong (2292) was an amazing confinement nanny for our family! She was so patient and calm with our baby boy. She easily fit into our home and worked well with our helper and our 19 month old daughter as well. She is a very hard worker, cooks delicious meals and kept everything clean and organized. We already miss her food! She helped me get a good amount of rest every day and night so I was able to heal well from my c section. We are Australian and her English and communication skills were very good.

"PEM Confinement Nanny Agency Pte Ltd","5","Aunty Ying (#1855) has been an amazing nanny for our baby in August 2025. We would like to thank her for her attention to detail and genuine care for us and our baby.

From the moment she started, we were impressed by her meticulous approach to everything, from preparing confinement meals to ensuring the baby's safety. She's always anticipating our baby's needs and catching small things that we might have missed.

She is very experienced and generously shares her knowledge with us and even takes the time to explain to us the reason behind her methods. We really appreciate how she repeats important advice, like how to properly burp the baby, how to prep bottles for pumping, or how store milk in the freezer. This repetition isn't just helpful, it shows her genuine commitment to making sure we are well-prepared and confident as parents.

Aunty Ying has become a cherished part of our family during her stay. Her professionalism, kindness, and deep love for what she does shine through in every interaction. We highly recommend her to any family looking for a nanny who goes above and beyond. A nanny with a big heart!

Sad to see her leave but at least we know we had a wonderful experience with Aunty Ying from PEM!

Additionally PEM services are very responsive and helpful. Smooth communication and zero hiccups. I had no regrets engaging PEM as our nanny provider and highly recommend anyone who is looking for one.","2025-08-24T03:14:33.826Z","0","Raymond Yong","16","true",,,"en","4 days ago",,"Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2paTlpXMU9OVUpLYzBsNmEyaGxWbU5JV1VwTVUyYxAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sCi9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2paTlpXMU9OVUpLYzBsNmEyaGxWbU5JV1VwTVUyYxAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x9676a0ccc259662f!3m1!1s2@1:CAIQACodChtycF9oOjZNZW1ONUJKc0l6a2hlVmNIWUpMU2c%7C0cecDOlFBcO%7C?hl=en","103750537081399000542","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJQbOM2zlowYgMZ4o3FtPfugb2NgpvD22Vm6Q8GsNAoLzXCJRo=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103750537081399000542?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With her professional knowledge of newborn care, she gave us so much valuable guidance and advice, which really gave us confidence as new parents. She also trained our helper on how to take care of the baby and even taught her cooking skills.

Every day, she prepared delicious meals for me, always checking what I would like for dessert, and even made sure to try her best to cook all the dishes I listed. She cared not only for the baby but also for me, offering gentle massages whenever I felt tired.

"PEM Confinement Nanny Agency Pte Ltd","5","I am thankful for Nanny Lai Chun’s (#1888 - Ten Lai Chun) help during this confinement period. As a first time mom, I struggle with knowing how to care for baby and also myself after delivery. Nanny Lai Chun was consistently assuring, supportive and patient in terms of caring for both my baby and me.

In terms of baby’s hygiene, she is extremely thorough, clean and diligent, going the extra mile to check baby’s diaper frequently and changing it promptly. I also appreciate that she is always willing to share and recommend good practices and baby products that she came across using with previous clients. Overall, she genuinely cares and tends to my baby very well. I feel assured leaving my baby under her care.

In terms of mother’s care, though she has her pov re how things need to be done and is open to share them, but she is also very aware and sensitive to my preferences. She would check in on how I feel, how I want things to be done and what kinds of food I like and tries her best to prepare them for me. She also takes initiative to provide extra help eg put my clothes in to wash (on top of doing baby’s) whenever she has the time or bandwidth to do so.

Nanny Lai Chun is generally also easy going and friendly. I find myself being able to chat comfortably with her about life and this helps me to get through the sometimes tiring confinement days.

"Sheffield Kidsworld ( St Anne) Pte. Ltd","5","We are so grateful to have found Sheffield Kidsworld (St Anne) for both our sons. The school has a strong focus on instilling values like responsibility, independence and beliefs about environmental sustainability from an early age, and the children are constantly engaged in activities that foster creativity, imaginative play, and speech expression. The Friday pool time is always a highlight for the children!

Class sizes are small, allowing each child to receive individualised attention. The school’s facilities are also excellent — with many varied spaces that ensure a rich and diverse learning experience. We also appreciate the frequent updates from the teachers regarding our children’s behaviour and progress, keeping us closely connected to their learning journey.

One instance that reflected the school’s dedication to safety was when a teacher immediately flagged my helper who was not careful when crossing the road with my child.

Our elder child, who was initially hyperactive, was nurtured with patience by caring teachers like Teacher Muna and Su Laoshi. Thanks to their support, he gradually learnt to settle down and thrive in a classroom environment. Numeracy and literacy were also very well covered; we never had to send our boys for additional enrichment classes like I Can Read or Berries. The Chinese spelling list was challenging though. Both my boys developed a strong foundation that prepared them well for primary school.

What truly sets Sheffield Kidsworld (St Anne) apart is Mr Puhal, the principal.

"Sheffield Kidsworld ( St Anne) Pte. Ltd","5","I will like to post my review on the marvellous educational system of Sheffield Kidsworld at St Anne, the principal and teachers in helping to nurture my child in this childcare centre. Currently, my son is in N1 at Sheffield Kidsworld St Anne.

Prior to enrolment to Sheffield Kidsworld, my son had a traumatic experience after 2 days of school in little footprints at 420 Sengkang. Son was not keen to attend any childcare school after the traumatic incident in his previous childcare centre. Had sleepless nights and not able to focus on any learning.

We had continued to source for preschool for my son. Chance upon on Sheffield Kidsworld, I call up the principal, Mr Puhal. He was patient and empathetic towards our son”s situation. He had a  close discussion with parents on how to help my son transit back to preschool effectively. Teachers at Sheffield Kidsworld were also informed of the traumatic experiences in the previous childcare centre and with their patience and dedication help my son transit and cope well in school now.

Through the last few months, I had observed my son effective transition into this childcare centre. He was initially still not keen or not able to cope with school. Through the compassion, care, patience and effective discussions from the principal and teachers from Sheffield Kidsworld at St Anne, my son is now able to transit effectively into school life. My son is happy and proud to attend school daily. I had also seen changes in my son learning. He is very keen in learning now. Had also participated in activities in school and is proud in going to school daily now.

I had also observe the school teachers on the childcare focus on the holistic development of my son since the day he started at Sheffield Kidsworld  St Anne.
I know that the school had provided a nurturing environment for effective learning as well

Lastly, I will like to take this opportunity to post this review as well to thank all the help especially to principal Mr Puhal, teachers- Muna, Sun Lao Shi, Stiffany for the dedication, patience and compassion in helping to nurture not only my son and all the children in Sheffield Kidsworld St Anne.
Thousand thanks 👍

Highly recommended!!!

"Sheffield Kidsworld ( St Anne) Pte. Ltd","5","My daughter has been with Sheffield Kidsworld @ St Anne’s since she was just 18 months old, all the way till her graduation. Before enrolling her, we searched high and low around Rivervale Estate for a preschool that could accept her as soon as she turned 18 months. We were fortunate to come across this hidden gem tucked away in a corner.

We were even luckier that the school accepted her early, even though it meant she had to stay in PG (Playgroup) a little longer than most. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise, especially because of Teacher Muna—who, despite not being a parent herself at the time, took amazing care of our little one and guided her with so much patience and love. Taking care of toddlers at that age is no easy feat!

Over the years, my girl blossomed. She became more bubbly, confident, and even got selected as one of the speakers at her graduation concert—a moment we’ll always treasure. The teachers, principal, and the management team are truly top-notch.

In fact, I trust this school so much that my other two younger kids are currently enrolled here too. I cannot recommend Sheffield Kidsworld enough!","2025-04-24T02:09:09.911Z","0","Cheryl Lim","4","false",,,"en","4 months ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURvMnItU2pnRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURvMnItU2pnRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x48745f7e89ff9eea!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgMDo2r-SjgE%7CCgwIxbqmwAYQyILqsgM%7C?hl=en","102070614027810776514","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX1ZFGX9qEmxf3WTVmzXO6muKPBkBpqXikEif_PQa-s6nfVVov5=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102070614027810776514?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides that, she is patient and willing to share her knowledge on all the enquiries I have about baby care .
On top of that , nanny taught us how to manage twin care day time and night time and she helped to train the helper until competent too before she left us .

"Gladys Care 1987","1","VERY Negative Experience with Gladys Care 1987 (Gladys Care)

My wife and I engaged Gladys Care 1987 (Gladys Care) for a confinement nanny in August 2023. We paid half of the agreed sum as a deposit. We informed the agency of our baby's expected delivery date (EDD) of March 20, 2024, and as per the contract, the nanny was supposed to be on standby one week prior to this date.

Upon admission to the hospital on March 20, 2024, at 4:30 PM, we promptly informed the agency of our imminent delivery. Our baby was born on March 21, 2024. However, the nanny only arrived on March 23, 2024, which was two days late. While we reluctantly accepted this delay, it was contractually unacceptable. The nanny was supposed to be on standby in Singapore, not in Malaysia, as the delay resulted in an extra night at the hospital.

During her tenure, the nanny’s service was causing worry, with her falling asleep during night shifts, causing distress to my wife. Despite these issues, we chose not to complain and worked directly with the nanny to ensure she got enough rest. (However, she is nice person and got along really well with us. She cooks well too and genuinely care for our baby! Shoutout to nanny Juliana, the one star i left on this review is for her!)

As the nanny’s term was ending on April 19, 2024, a conflict arose. The agency was demanding the remaining deposit, and we requested a discussion for a discount due to the nanny's late arrival. We held back the payment but never displayed any intent of not paying.

On the last day of the nanny's service, we were hosting a party at 7 PM to celebrate our baby’s full month. The nanny, whose shift was to end at 12 PM, informed the agency she would stay for the party and return afterward.

Meanwhile, we tried to reach the agency for a compromise on the fees, but Gladys did not respond.

At 6 PM, Gladys came to our unit, behaving rudely and accusing us of forcibly holding back the nanny and refusing to pay. Instead of engaging in an amicable discussion, she shouted at us and even involved the police, claiming it was her professional duty to ensure the baby was fine.

However, after the police left, no further checks were made on the baby, contrary to her assertion. Her actions ruined our party.

The police, after hearing both sides, found her unreasonable and acknowledged that she did not follow the contractual agreement. Although we paid the remaining deposit as she refused to negotiate, the police affirmed that we had the right to write a review or make a complaint to CASE.

Despite the distress caused by Gladys, we initially chose to let it go. However, we later discovered she had deliberately informed us late about the nanny’s work permit post-service process, resulting in an extra two weeks of work levy payment.

This was the final straw. To anyone considering Gladys Care, we strongly advise against it. Our experience, from the initial delay to the unprofessional and rude behavior of Gladys, was a nightmare. Even the nanny herself was shocked at the way the agent handled the situation.

For anyone looking for a confinement nanny, avoid Gladys Care / Gladys Yip at all costs. The stress and unprofessionalism are not worth it.

PS: This is only a brief description of the events. The intention of this post is merely to prevent other parents to be from encountering a similar ordeal. The reply to this review is twisted FYI. Engage at your own risk.  :)","2024-06-22T11:46:56.594Z","0","Gabriel","10","false","2024-06-21T10:51:36.000Z","Dear Mr Chia

Thank you for your feedback. 

It is always our  priorty to serve each and every customer well. 

Just as when I first meet your mother on 19 April 2024 830pm, I am very thankful that she has sing praises of our nannies and kept Thanking us which Gladys Care  had assigned for your 2 elder  sisters whom has given birth afew years ago. 

I have  attached some of nanny's Juliana feedback from others mommy that nanny Juliana is a good and caring nanny. 

We noted your feedback and we will look into the connection time to work better for our mommy. 

However, we should be honest in making this feedback while why we seek help from the police. 

1)  From time to time, we have informed you that we have make a immediate booking transport  of nanny coming into Singapore on 22 March 2024 midnight and arrival on 23 March 2024 at 1030am,   although mommy Madam Lim Cy was allow to  discharge on same day on 22 March 2024.  (you have understand the situation and gladly agreed to nanny Julian's 23 March 2024 1030am arrival) . 

Mommy Cy has requested for  compension on the last day of service.  On a goodwill basis,  I have  offered   mommy Cy - if nanny can stay one more day. But mommy Cy replied that she don't need. 

While we have follow up for payment on last day Mommy Cy then has sent me 2  messages requesting for an amount of money to be adjusted in the - 70% balance  payment. (you have also mentioned this  request to nanny Juliana on her last of service on 19 April 2024 ) 

2) On 19 April  2024 nanny ended her 28 day service at 12pm.   We have waited till 19:30pm but still did not receive payment or any respond from madam Cy, despite Nanny has fully tendered well her service.  

As it is getting late and there is no reply nor payment from mommy Cy, and  nanny was not reachable on her mobile, we then seeked the police advise and help to handle   -  police has advise since it's 8pm and nanny has well tendered her service but since payment was not make, it is then rightful to make a trip to your house as a represented agent of nanny Juliana.  

3) Please note that when I reached your house, you and mommy Cy  mentioned that you all like nanny Juliana very much and she takes care baby very well and cooks very well ( as you have mentioned in your review).

You and mommy Cy have mainly ask me to negotiate an agreeable amount but my answer to you is as police advised to wait for their arrival. (I did not make a scence at your house, I have mentioned to you that we will discuss this when police arrival) 

It is after police arrival and  explained to you that since you have fully uterlised nanny 28days  service. 

4) At your house, we have also further  clarified   that during the 28days there was no daily proper rest time given to nanny Juliana - 
Nanny Juliana in the presence of the police officers has asked mommy Cy - ' mommy you know I have been helping through this 28days I was not given proper rest time, you all were watching drama and did not offer to help take over baby. 
Correct mommy' ? Mommy Cy then nodded her head as yes.. It was then further verified by the police with you that baby is all well and all are happy with nanny Juliana service during these 28days.  It is then police have asked you to make payment duely. On 19 April 2024 between 830pm - 9pm mommy Cy transfered the balance 70% payment . 

In this situation,   we have to seek police help in order to resolve this matter and prevent any allegation after nanny leave.
As for the working permit was till 19 April 2024, I have called mommy Cy on 19 April 24 after we left your place and message was follow up to mommy Cy to acknowledged cancelation, apparently there was no respond or reply from mommy Cy. 

We have noted your feedback and we will continue to make improvements to provide better  service for our mommy.

"Gladys Care 1987","5","I am extremely grateful for the support and guidance I received from Gladys. As a new mom, I struggled with breastfeeding and felt frustrated and worried that I wasn't producing enough milk for my baby. In desperation, I texted Gladys in the middle of the night, and she kindly visited me the next day.

Gladys is a compassionate and knowledgeable lactation consultant. My milk ducts were clogged and needed a boost to kick-start production, and Gladys' TCM massages effectively activated them. Thanks to Gladys, I was able to establish a successful breastfeeding experience.

After completing the TCM sessions, my milk flow improved significantly, making breastfeeding and pumping faster and more efficient. My supply also increased, allowing me to fulfill my baby's needs.

I highly recommend Gladys to any mom seeking lactation support. Her dedication, expertise, and kindness are exceptional, and I feel fortunate to have had her by my side throughout my breastfeeding journey. For those who are struggling , with the right support, any mom can overcome challenges and successfully breastfeed. Good luck mommas and Thank you Gladys! 😊","2024-05-01T08:50:48.328Z","0","Silvia","6","false","2024-06-25T04:10:06.000Z","Thank you Silvia,

"Gladys Care 1987","5","I recently delivered my child a few weeks earlier than the EDD due to certain complications which I was having. As such, I was worried about the confinement nanny situation due to these sudden last minute developments.

However, Gladys really went out of her way to ensure that both baby & myself were fully covered & well taken care of by a nanny after coming home from the hospital.

I would also like to specially mention nanny Ming Zhu as she has been cooking delicious meals for both my husband & myself.
Her attention to noticing our baby's details has been very assuring to us as well.

Gladys' post-natal massages have indeed  been very reliving & effective in reducing the post-pregnancy water retention/bloating. Would highly recommend choosing Gladys Care to all new mums/mums-to-be!","2024-04-05T16:08:31.295Z","0","Josy Qiu","4","false","2024-04-05T17:23:55.000Z","Dear Joslyn,

She’s a loving and kindly presence in our family and provided excellent care with incredible patience. Gladys also takes good care of her staff, ensuring their wellness while they take care of our little one. It had a profound impact on our baby’s development. The nanny was the first to point out our baby loved to smile, and he could even wave goodbye hesitantly by watching her. As we approach the last few days of our engagement with this nanny, she has been sharing tips on how to take care of the baby for the next few months to come, which we so appreciate.

"Gladys Care 1987","1","poor experience with the nannies from this agency. Although the agent was responsive and tried to salvage the situation, the quality of the nannies are really poor.

First nanny - obsessed with her phone (did not turn off notification sounds), did not burp baby sufficiently resulting in frequent vomiting, used phone while taking care of baby. Unhygienic practices of letting bb drink unfinished formula milk after 1-2 hours. Complained to us about her pay and helped herself to our food w/o asking.

(Add on a point on the vomiting, apart from over-feeding that resulted in frequent vomiting (projectile vomit, not spitting milk), it was established that the nanny didn’t burp the baby sufficiently which resulted in baby vomiting in her sleep. Now, this is dangerous. The vomiting part is still manageable. Vomiting in sleep is not acceptable!)

Replacement nanny - not trained in confinement (machiam like housewife). cannot wash anything clean (milk bottles were oily after she washed). cooked about less than 1l of red dates tea for me initially and had to tell her to cook more. prepare herbal bath one time and use for 2 days (the herbal water kept till smelly). Complained about us over the phone and kena caught because we could hear from baby monitor. Food was the same everyday, tasteless sometimes and very repetitive. She cooks the same few veggie, chicken and rarely fish. Husband asked her what fish to buy she told us to ask the fish monger. Dismissed her finally because she gave bb formula milk every hour during the night shift because she didn't know why baby was crying and kept feeding bb milk.

Both nannies do not know how to update logs - time, amount of feeding, time of poop etc.

These are just some of the issues highlighted. Overall, the quality of the 2 nannies provided to me are poor, not professional and do not appear to be well trained. Really regretted taking this agency.","2023-10-26T02:30:54.521Z","0","CZ","14","true","2023-10-12T00:40:24.000Z","Dear Claire

Your whatsapp message mentioned - 
[9/4, 03:45] C Claire 28 Aug 23: Hi Gladys, we would like to replace the nanny. She has requested this herself. Please get her replaced asap.
[9/4, 03:45] C Claire 28 Aug 23: Please liaise with her yourself. Thanks.

On 4/9/23 (08:12am) Nanny SL was 8th day of service, this is your 1st call informing baby has vomittted at 08:12am.   This was due to the formula feeding clustered. (Not administered by first nanny, nanny log record trend was within 2 or 2 half hour feeding breast milk in priority then follow by formula if needed top up)

On 6/9/23 (23:47) we have sent you a whatsapp message to verify and confirm if above cluster was fed by first nanny. 

On 7/9/23 (08:01) you have replied in  whatsapp confirming that the 3 clusters formula on 4/9/23  from 3am was not administered by first nanny.  
(You have whatsapp replied  -   Hi Gladys, no, we took our baby in at around 3am on 4 Sep 2023 and SL’s last feed was 4am. 

On 6/9/23 - 2nd nanny was replaced.

On 12/6/23 - a follow up if 2nd nanny helping you and baby well, you have whatsapp replied - (Hi Gladys, thanks for checking in. Our baby is doing quite well. She hasn’t vomited milk so far and has been sleeping well at night with only about 2-3 regular feeds. Our experience with nanny LY is quite ok so far. Can see that nanny LY puts in effort to burp baby well and shows genuine concern for baby’s well-being. Nanny LY is also more receptive to our suggestions, so we find it easier to work things with her in general)","en","Edited a year ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM1dE02UmxRRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM1dE02UmxRRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xe45926c6bcc633c1!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIC5tM6RlQE%7CCgwI3p7nqQYQ0MDJ-AE%7C?hl=en","101270157766774384014","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW92bK9crCahSDVw9OccaFpgLGzY8r1l823SQDqhGfejBW44_x3=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101270157766774384014?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Gladys Care 1987","5","Background:
We hired nanny Jenny from Gladys agency for our first born baby. As we had no experience with baby care at all. We have a European background and the Asian confinement services were new to use.

Experience: outstanding/ superb (🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 5/5)
When returning home from the hospital, where my breastfeeding journey did not wanted to start properly, with our firstborn whom we did not knew yet (or fully understood): we arrived home and nanny Jenny was there! Immediately helping out and teaching us everything (as we are quite hands on parents we enjoyed being involved). Nanny Jenny has been our superhero throughout the journey! She has taught us everything about baby care, sleeping, soothing, bathing, feeding, caring, day and night routine, baby gym and so much more.

Nanny Jenny is very proactive, hands-on, solution oriented. When she noticed our baby struggled with Jaundice, our baby had sunbathing moments. When she noticed a blocked nose, it was immediately resolved. When our baby was a little older and he had long nails, she cut them. When our baby had cramps, nanny Jenny knew what to do. And there are many more examples.

Nanny Jenny has set us up for success with our firstborn. Because of her, we felt confident to take care of our baby, we felt we knew our baby, we understood his different cries and we had created a good baby routine. This would not have been possible without her.

Aside from that, nanny Jenny has helped me enormously in the breastfeeding journey. It was a painful journey and I would have stopped already without her. However, she knew all tips and tricks to make it more comfortable, to have less pain, to better latch the baby, to prevent bleeding nipples etc. And I am very thankful to her. As breastfeeding is a special intimate moment between mother and child!

Nanny Jenny is a very genuine, warm hearted, fun person. Aside from her 10+ experience in the baby care / confinement industry, she is also a wonderful person to have in your house.

Last but not least, Gladys services have been excellent. Aside from the nanny services, I went for belly wrapping massage and it made a big difference! During the massage, Gladys noticed my low blood pressure and recommended me a specific TCM tea. Which she bought for me and brought along to the next massage. This customized treatment is superb! Also I had a lactation massage, which has been such a relief ever since. Before of the massage my breasts were quite hard with a lot of knobs, and after the massage the milk is flowing with any hard knobs in there. Gladys has outstanding knowledge and really knows what she is doing!!

Thank you so much for everything!! I will contact you for my second child 🥰","2023-09-07T02:49:13.974Z","0","Meija Bossert","1","false","2024-03-07T02:24:15.000Z","Thank you Mai for your kindness to nanny and trust for our sevice.

In the baby’s second month, he stayed up all night and slept sporadically in the day. Julie stayed up carrying baby all night despite being very tired, and used various methods to ensure that she was alert.
In two short months, Julie has become a part of our family. She gets along with everyone, including my mother in law and my helper. She is a joy and I strongly recommend her.

The facilities at Ilham Childcare are clean, well-maintained, and child-friendly. The team does an excellent job ensuring safety and hygiene, which gives me peace of mind every day.

I appreciate how Ilham Childcare incorporates cultural and moral values into their teaching. It’s wonderful to see my son learning about respect, kindness, and responsibility while having fun.

It would be great to have more parent-involvement activities, like open houses or family days. These events could help build a stronger connection between families and the childcare team. ☺️","2024-11-26T00:07:03.931Z","0","Sweetlys","3","false",,,"en","9 months ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQbWU2Y0dBEAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQbWU2Y0dBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x1bf917dae745f614!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICPme6cGA%7CCgwIp6KUugYQgNSPvAM%7C?hl=en","104699315214122204452","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVByfclycbayTw1O8ecIt9Q0ZMSlQz-xsjFUbcDiFx1u4Sn4pc5=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104699315214122204452?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Ilham Child Care (North) Pte Ltd","5","Highly recommend Ilham Childcare (North)! The teachers are really dedicated and warm, and take the effort to know each child individually. My child looks forward to going to school everyday because she gets to be herself at school - and the teachers support each child for their strengths and weaknesses.

The teachers are also open to provide feedback on children, and will work with parents to help children develop (e.g. stop using pacifiers).

Parent engagement is also good, parents and families are invited to the Centre for key events like Hari Raya, Mothers’/Fathers’ Day to celebrate with the children.

The other non-teaching staff are also very friendly and are caring towards the children. Meals served are healthy and of good variety as well.

If you want your children in good and trusted hands, this might be the place for you!","2023-06-19T13:09:03.534Z","0","Muhammad Zulkarnain Azman","2","false",,,"en","2 years ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKOE56RkZ3EAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKOE56RkZ3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x1bf917dae745f614!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICJ8NzFFw%7CCgwI76bBpAYQ-JHe_gE%7C?hl=en","116035595188937670147","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJ_sj-Sh9bNg5ysVCu2pxp2YlW0NutD2ssharOBdpQoK-u59w=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116035595188937670147?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I wanted to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional dedication, patience, and care you show each and every day towards my son , Muhammad Zuhair from K2 Gracious.

As a parent, I’ve seen firsthand the positive impact your guidance and support have had on my son since he joined the school from Playgroup until now. There's a lot of improvements shown in my son from academically & mannerism.

From the thoughtful lessons to the encouraging words and the safe, nurturing environment you've created, it’s clear that this is more than just a school—it's a community built on commitment and compassion.

Thank you for not only educating minds but also inspiring hearts. Your work shapes the future in ways words can hardly capture.

Please know that your efforts do not go unnoticed and are deeply valued by our family.

With sincere thanks,
Zakiyah

"Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool at Ang Mo Kio","5","As a first-time parent, I was so nervous about leaving my baby in someone else's care, but I couldn't be happier with our decision to enroll at this infant care center. The teachers are absolute angels—they're incredibly caring and professional, and it's clear they love what they do. The facility itself is spotless, bright, and so well-equipped, and I have complete peace of mind knowing my little one is in such a safe environment. With a fantastic 1:3 teacher-to-baby ratio, I know my child is getting all the personal attention they need to thrive.
The communication from the teachers is simply outstanding. They use an app that provides real-time updates on everything—from feeding and diaper changes to nap schedules. It’s so reassuring to get those notifications throughout the day. Plus, they always share photos of all the fun activities! We get to see our baby enjoying tummy time, playing with new toys, and interacting with their friends. It's truly a highlight of our day to see those little snapshots.
This center goes above and beyond to make every day special. They plan daily activities that are both fun and enriching, and they do an amazing job of organizing special cultural celebrations and holiday events. Getting those adorable photos of our baby in their holiday outfit is just the sweetest thing! This center is more than just a daycare; it's a supportive, loving community, and we couldn't be more grateful for the incredible care our baby receives.","2025-08-20T23:34:30.249Z","0","Erik Tan","6","false",,,"en","a week ago",,"Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25sNmNsUmlhbFZ0TUdkaVMwNXJTSEpNZW1NdGMxRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sCi9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25sNmNsUmlhbFZ0TUdkaVMwNXJTSEpNZW1NdGMxRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xa7f5cd22bb9e4cde!3m1!1s2@1:CAIQACodChtycF9oOnl6clRialVtMGdiS05rSHJMemMtc1E%7C0cd_i5DrYlU%7C?hl=en","108870539979412496301","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV4kPAXgytZWP3Tm6lewet8fS13izd4bqN6EW1EY7H1Dl1OLnNJ=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108870539979412496301?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One thing I really appreciated was how frequently they updated us with photos and little notes, those small gestures made a big difference. The two Principals are also very friendly and approachable, which made communication smooth and easy.

It’s with a heavy heart that we had to transfer our son to another centre due to personal reasons.

My daughter didn't speak much when she joined at 18 months but now she can recognise Chinese characters and speak aplenty!

"Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool at Ang Mo Kio","5","We enrolled our 18m daughter in Sunny Bunny 4 months ago and we’ve had a great experience with the school! The teachers are extremely warm and caring and genuinely love and care for our daughter. They are very happy to see her every morning and make her feel very welcome. She managed to stay in school for a full day on her first day and cried for less than a week - we believe this is testament to how the teachers have helped her settle into a completely new environment. We get very regular updates (and even photos of her eating and napping everyday). Teachers even specifically update us on what food she enjoys in particular in school so that we can offer it to her at home. She looks forward to going to school even on weekends and will try to put on her uniform. We also observed first hand how the teachers care for the children on excursions and how much the children love their teachers. Thank you teachers! She has also learnt a lot since she started school and is surprisingly proficient in Mandarin!

"Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool at Ang Mo Kio","5","My son transferred to Sunny Bunny 2 months ago, from a branded preschool. His change so far is impressing and very positive.

In the previous school he was reluctant to attend school and always asked us to pick him up on time. Now he is actually asking us to come later so that he can play more with his friends and teachers at school! I am so impressed by the kindness, and the bright smiles among all the teachers. No wonder my kid would like to stay at school.

That being said, it is not just the calm and happiness this school brings to my kid, but also I can see his enthusiasm in study is back, and continuously growing. His reading capability in both Chinese and English makes great progress, he now can entertain himself alone with his books! ( thank god, it gives me and my husband some quiet time😂)

Teacher Maria and Teacher Hu has gone above and beyond to welcome our boy from day one. The owner of the centre (Hui Ling) whose children are also attending the centre was very reassuring to us as parents as well.

The school has a great outdoor and indoor play area very suitable for kid's physical activities. They also have a in house cook that prepares meals for the kids. Our boy has put on a bit of weight since he join Sunny Bunny.

"Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool at Ang Mo Kio","5","I wanted to share our positive experience with Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool, especially for our son. He has been attending the school for the past four months, and we have noticed tremendous growth and development during this time.

Firstly, my son has adapted exceptionally well to the school environment within just two weeks. It's been heartwarming to witness his enthusiasm for going to school every day. He has even started sharing the names of his teachers with us, including TR Maria, Hu Lao Shi, Chen Lao Shi, and Aunty Kim. This shows that he has built a good rapport with the teachers and feels comfortable in their presence.

One thing that sets Sunny Bunny Montessori apart from other preschools we considered is the evident love and care provided by the teachers. The atmosphere at the school radiates warmth and positivity, making it a nurturing environment for children. It's reassuring as parents to know that our child is in such capable hands.

The school's curriculum and activities have also contributed to our son's growth. Through the pictures and videos shared on the school's application, we can see that he has daily playground sessions and afternoon language sessions, where he is exposed to Mandarin. It's truly impressive that he is already able to speak some Mandarin sentences.

My son's love for the school extends beyond the classroom. He often recites the songs he learns at school, especially the phonics songs, when he's at home and even before going to sleep. This demonstrates the positive impact the school's teachings have on his learning and enjoyment.

Lastly, we appreciate the monthly field trips organized by the school, which allow us as parents to tag along. These outings not only provide an opportunity for us to bond with Davian but also help us feel more involved in his preschool experience.

Overall, we are extremely pleased with Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool. The supportive teachers, engaging curriculum, and the sense of community make it a fantastic learning environment for our son. We highly recommend the school to other parents seeking a nurturing and holistic preschool for their children.","2024-04-25T09:02:59.256Z","0","Delwin Koh","7","false",,,"en","a year ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqNDZLQ3B3RRAB","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90A3YZ6Px4vdodlKF259t8n5BYYIeLEk3v6yZZWwZKTL_Jjc4RCnmGpDMiCDA-TJxwXLPazeD6lOI1f8qDbVZ-x_blNQiO-sy2VDcwTUPaB_T-EBrhQSsEABryVC-ltfY0Lo-fPb","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90BzMwVO-UuxorOjgMYQ6ncUOMNm1LcwEetK2pjN10teO-prmXiEgDjFA7dMEh-BHdblllbvm_DFyRdvlolPg_mEqn8P62JBiWLAH6nkHdFydg8P9uAqX8zzhMo0Gn3WBz5Yz6uW","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90DpYyH1bBpemA6ESeRair8onTLWrT70ZDmQfTboWVKsrknSNsJfW4w62lDqmCCAF_XYdfavxqW6Tm3nwNygLmldlXfgGmcEkLjVhcwHrwNFJd17o_safmd8Bn_acMqKBeDi6yc","Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqNDZLQ3B3RRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xa7f5cd22bb9e4cde!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICj46KCpwE%7CCgsIw7iosQYQsNS7eg%7C?hl=en","108598637395062137568","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWN1V5JPtnDrcLHXeF90fOGfrBVRD9dGbrdZ1K4so4Fgoal3b35XQ=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108598637395062137568?hl=en",,,,"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90An7SB-ryXYIGVOR62Fyf0mlQQmRVe4SYz1T_B5rR3XyelfPhQI2kEEOiAZh8nquLPVeXYwjnyLHgkru98OaFDaZyJIqJaiScVq4fdP94TviSyoPsEa3eqI7_ETcOMMi_KPzm1iXw","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90BVe1ZHrVj5Tb8iXWh2l1EhCBcaMpbJ9wV01VdBjVbVcAhlvpgYgFJZfGBdDFgiKyImVT28VsxYb_Rd4nqL6yJuI1W_cCq2N2KJ8wwFypvFKdHKWS6Qpvf48chIx2eFL63Q3ns",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool at Ang Mo Kio","5","Very good pre-school from which my 5 kids graduated. This shows how consistent the school has been through the years in their quality of curriculum and educators. The school has a knack for hiring teachers with golden hearts- who truly care for the kids and desire the best for them. They stretch the kids but at the same time, their well-being comes first. The teachers genuinely love the kids and take pride in watching them progress through the years. It is a rare find- a gem of a school. Fees are high though not much higher than many private centres. With the strong curriculum, I do not need to spend extra to put my kids in enrichment centres and can spend quality time w them on precious weekends. And because of the excellent care, SBM has given me a peace of mind to know my kids are in very good hands which in priceless for a working mother.

"Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool at Ang Mo Kio","5","Sending our 3-year-old son to Sunny Bunny Preschool has been one of the best decisions we've made as parents. The school's environment is nurturing, engaging, and designed to foster creativity and curiosity in young minds. The school team is incredibly supportive and attentive to each child's needs, ensuring a personalized learning experience.

What sets Sunny Bunny Preschool apart is its holistic approach to early childhood education. The curriculum is thoughtfully designed to balance academic learning with essential life skills, promoting social, emotional, and intellectual development. Our son has shown remarkable progress in his communication abilities, social interactions, and problem-solving skills.

Moreover, the school places a strong emphasis on parent-teacher communication, keeping us informed and involved in our child's learning journey!

Would highly recommend parents to consider Sunny Bunny Preschool as their child's early education!","2024-03-06T03:22:39.245Z","0","Yu Qi Ng","11","false",,,"en","a year ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5dnVLTkRnEAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5dnVLTkRnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xa7f5cd22bb9e4cde!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIC9vuKNDg%7CCgsI_8KfrwYQgO6ddQ%7C?hl=en","113955183143060808976","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIY9IFyxPygNijDdJn5nMF7hBf5qHXxJJc6tTkAINHYGrlF7A=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113955183143060808976?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool at Ang Mo Kio","5","Sunny Bunny Montessori deserves 5 star good review. My son has been in the school for 2 months now and he is adjusting to school very well. He looks forward to going to school everyday and so far he didn’t get sick. Compared to the previous franchised pre school that we sent him to, he go sick every two weeks in the previous school and we were unable to send him for full day curriculum.

Sunny Bunny Montessori has very strong academic curriculum as well. My son develops cognitive and language skills quickly from the school curriculum. He can even recognise Chinese characters and enjoys reading. He develops good habits that he finds books to read on his own. He enjoys singing the songs learned from school and showcased to us when gets back home.

I can tell that the teachers are truly caring and my son loves all the teachers. He will repeat saying teacher Maria, chen laoshi, hu laoshi, teach Lindy at home.

The school also organises monthly excursion trips and my son also enjoys going to it. This creates valuable bonding time between the children and parents. The teachers also planned the itinerary very well, full of fun and something to take away.

I have been recommending the school to my friends though it is not a franchised school and very few people know about it. It is no doubt a hidden gem school which deserves all the 5 star reviews!","2024-03-05T05:11:38.318Z","0","Cindy Fu Xin","6","false",,,"en","a year ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5cHUzNzBnRRAB","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90AydHQ3MGnXR85Qi1C410cWEmTjAZYlEv257xALavCU66QQ7uykxTQLmwDGmmBx8F_pQnZbBUYT8a8eXveGNzHIYnCWUPM0Gan5K-NsnMJ2t8BulmeE9OHzZgi6uV_GtsDs2A7x","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90APnUOkTib95mxJa7of4IG3VBtpvCuvDKSRb3E1jesVqfR-km3f9UOUfFoQRUyCIQxuT90sC0cZumW0iS7rUImMgrXNO0zkhmMnxr6s_8gNqhiUSa5oqdBFfNBk3KO675cv_xNzjg","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90DIhUn3U07NbyW3tx_M-eqf3OmTkcm8cif6gcMi25ed4JmKzG-akns_IG30BP9K37sxQw0B5e0UK6gT7c1ul2CaNtyykCbBh3Pz0CfbB85MrV1Ldc-dBw18n4D--UC4N-kCpqA","Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5cHUzNzBnRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xa7f5cd22bb9e4cde!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIC9pu370gE%7CCgwIitOarwYQ-M2FmAE%7C?hl=en","114348317618646073087","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVs8-AauJRTrpEtv65Xj2sk8pkG1SFNPgH81OMJEkMw9FTiijZU=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114348317618646073087?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool at Ang Mo Kio","5","Our daughter went to Sunny Bunny when she was only 18 months old. At first, we were quite worried about whether she could adapt. It was during COVID then, and we seldom brought her out, so she became very attached to us so much so that when she goes to somewhere unfamiliar, she would became very nervous. But surprisingly, she adapted to life in Sunny Bunny very quickly and very well! Only a few weeks in, we could tell that she became more outgoing, more confident and more sociable. After 2 months when she was about 20 months old, we were confident enough to allow her to take the school bus on her own, and she enjoyed it very much. It was such a relief for us and we are very grateful to the school.

The teachers in Sunny Bunny are very caring. Special thanks to Teacher Maria and Chen Laoshi!! They're very patient, and attend to every child's individual needs. One of the many examples - Because my daughter usually takes a long time to finish her meals, Teacher Maria and Chen Laoshi would specially prepared small bite-sized apple cubes for my daughter. They would mix it into the rice, to encourage my daughter to chew more. They would  also always try to make sure that she finishes her food.

The overall environment in Sunny Bunny is very warm and welcoming. Thanks to the Montessori method, my daughter is familiar with all teachers and students in the school. She likes to take care of the younger ones and newer ones in school, just like how she had been taken care of when she first went to the school. She has a lot of friends in the school, and she even knows all their siblings by name as well!

Academic wise, Sunny Bunny is very strong, especially in the Chinese language. We were very pleased to see that my daughter was able to recognize a whole stack of Chinese characters, and able to read when she was 3 yo. There are other enrichment classes embedded into the curriculum, like Ping Pong class, Robotics, gym class, and these are all my daughter's favourites.

I would recommend Sunny Bunny to any parent who want their children to be in a caring school with strong academics and a fun curriculum.","2024-02-18T00:29:48.069Z","0","Winnie BI","4","false",,,"en","a year ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkazdLMVBnEAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkazdLMVBnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xa7f5cd22bb9e4cde!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICdk7K1Pg%7CCgsI_J7FrgYQsLesIQ%7C?hl=en","108297345467844196449","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKxSF1nctC3hgjJuOlu78fBtvPBuEVS3MEJc1FNckhRvzzfwA=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108297345467844196449?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She adjusted to the environment very smoothly on the first day, all thanks to the nurturing teachers and environment. No crying and separation anxiety at all.

For parents still contemplating whether to enrol, this childcare centre is indeed a good choice. I had past experiences enrolling my 2 older ones in a branded childcare centre with many branches (many franchised) but had withdrawn them to join Sunny Bunny Montessori. When assessing a childcare centre, understanding the management’s commitment to taking care of staff and children’s needs is crucial. I am thankful to have come across Sunny Bunny and have a peace of mind at work.","2024-02-07T00:19:48.053Z","0","Sheryl L","8","true",,,"en","a year ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR0aV9UNjdnRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR0aV9UNjdnRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xa7f5cd22bb9e4cde!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDti_T67gE%7CCgsIpJmLrgYQ0NPFGQ%7C?hl=en","101306597567161335752","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJPcy81sbzYpYEFdJufgnyvYGpJgjk7CLKqgCJaHxB1FOk3-A=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101306597567161335752?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ever-since she joined Sunny Bunny Montessori, everyday she is looking forward to go school and every night she too excited to sleep.

Besides that, she also improving on her life skills such as button her own clothing, eating meal by herself. Her motor skills improved as well by doing a lot of outdoor gym and indoor ping pong and rock climbing.

The most surprising is that her Chinese from she doesn’t know how to speak and now she can even pronounce difficult chinese words and read in sentence and paragraph within a month.

And we also witness she dare to kick off diaper wit the encouragements from her loving teachers.

We really grateful and appreciate to the warm, loving and patience Teacher Nayak, Li Lao Shi and Ms Ang. Beyond words to express how we feel, we really so glad that our girl is part of Sunny Bunny Montessori Family.

"Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool at Ang Mo Kio","5","I send my 3 kids (2 boys and 1 girl) aged 2 years apart to Sunny Bunny Montessori since 2017. Most importantly, my kids received excellent preschool education with dedicated teachers & excellent facilities, especially with the Montessori way of imparting knowledge.

My eldest boy has special needs, and Sunny Bunny was able to conduct some early intervention techniques. I guess that is the wonder of the Montessori way.

Another aspect of Sunny Bunny is the Mandarin curriculum. Simply amazing. Every child is guaranteed to recognise 4000 Mandarin characters before entering Primary school. Their exposure to Mandarin at such a young age and ability to read Mandarin characters was astounding to me.

Sunny Bunny has robotics (they send teams to participate in the annual robotics competition), gym classes, table tennis, Mathematics, Mandarin, English ALL in the curriculum, and year end, the children are exposed to preparing for the annual year end concert cum graduation.

The toys/equipment used for the lessons are top notch. Even during the Covid years when HBL was implemented, all the teachers at Sunny Bunny conducted full day lessons everyday through HBL. There were no making up of excuses to close down the centre for a few days just because of Covid.

Now that my kids have graduated from Sunny Bunny, I feel almost sad that my kids have left an golden era of being so well-taken care of at Sunny Bunny. A lot of the children who graduated from SB all managed to enter top tier primary schools and achieved getting awards.","2023-12-16T17:25:35.426Z","0","Xi Tao Chui","14","true",,,"en","a year ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWbS03UFlREAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWbS03UFlREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xa7f5cd22bb9e4cde!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDVm-7PYQ%7CCgwIj7v3qwYQiIXFywE%7C?hl=en","114513114107907110856","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJ-yrLXrjrad4EsoPlxT60gAXK2ox9-vaZMLzfuwuv6YUotjw=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114513114107907110856?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool at Ang Mo Kio","5","Visited Sunny Bunny Montessori's Open House on 17 Dec 2022.

We were invited to freely explore the premise where there were many areas and rooms for different purposes. We were amazed when we went into the kids gym room where we saw a few of their preschoolers practising their the table tennis skills like a pro and we had no doubts that they can even compete with adults.

The teachers also introduced us to their vast range of learning materials (i.e. playcards, beads, wood blocks, bowls with pasta etc) which they use in their everyday curriculum to teach the kids on mathematics, language and even practical life skills.

As a new parent, it was an true eye-opener for us to see how different this preschool is compared to normal neighbourhood preschools. I believe the kids enrolled into this preschool will be moulded into elites with a promising future!","2022-12-19T04:57:15.446Z","0","Melody Tan","10","false",,,"en","2 years ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCeklXdWpnRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCeklXdWpnRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xa7f5cd22bb9e4cde!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICBzIWujgE%7CCgwIq97_nAYQyN_01AE%7C?hl=en","102529967928126887436","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJN2ULDcpL9aIBpvW1Ibrp6--ooM1MrRNrhMPH8nbu7PdsTHg=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102529967928126887436?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Dedicated Student Care Centre (Main Centre)","5","Dedicated Student Care is a truly commendable service that offers comprehensive support for students navigating their academic journey. The care provided is both holistic and personalized, ensuring that each student’s unique needs are met.

The standout feature of Dedicated Student Care is its focus on individualized attention. Whether a student needs help with academic challenges, mental health support, or guidance on career choices, the program is well-equipped to offer relevant assistance. The staff members are not only knowledgeable but also genuinely invested in the well-being and success of the students. They take the time to understand each student's situation, offering tailored advice and resources that can make a real difference.

Moreover, the accessibility of the services is another major plus. Whether through scheduled appointments, drop-in hours, or online support, students have multiple ways to seek help. This flexibility ensures that students can receive the support they need without adding extra stress to their already busy schedules.

The integration of mental health support within the Dedicated Student Care program is also noteworthy. In an era where student stress and anxiety are at an all-time high, having access to qualified counselors and mental health resources is invaluable. The program doesn't just focus on academic success but also prioritizes the overall well-being of the students.

In terms of areas for improvement, expanding the range of services to include more specialized academic tutoring or workshops on specific skills could enhance the program even further. Additionally, increasing awareness among students about the full scope of services available could ensure that more students take advantage of the support offered.

Overall, Dedicated Student Care is a vital resource for students, providing them with the tools, support, and guidance they need to thrive both academically and personally. The commitment to student well-being is evident, making it a crucial part of the student experience.","2024-08-29T06:05:11.444Z","0","waffles","2","false",,,"en","11 months ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3aDRXYVpnEAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3aDRXYVpnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x4f4d15948e44d205!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgID7h4WaZg%7CCgwIl5_AtgYQ-KiE1AE%7C?hl=en","112923940186694999208","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWnDNXzuHww9SzxRwpiOuNGhocTjYKNHKRXX_gITiX8-33-JBk=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112923940186694999208?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"MindChamps PreSchool @ Punggol Digital District","5","I had a very positive experience attending the recent MRW workshop organized by the school. The workshop was incredibly helpful in giving us, as parents, a clearer understanding of how teachers conduct lessons in class and what our children are currently learning. It also provided practical tips on how we can support our child’s learning at home.

I would like to especially commend Ms Katherine for her patience and dedication. She took the time to guide us through the online learning platform and shared valuable suggestions on how to help our children at home. I also truly appreciate the effort she made to show my child’s learning video in class, which I believe has boosted her confidence greatly.

This experience reminded me of the importance of revising the content at home with our children. Reinforcing what they’ve learned in school not only strengthens their understanding but also builds a strong foundation for their continued learning journey.","2025-07-10T06:01:00.737Z","0","fion zhao","5","false",,,"en","a month ago",,"Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT20xNmVqQjBURVpGV1dOelRUWk5VRWhGYjJ0WGNsRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sCi9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT20xNmVqQjBURVpGV1dOelRUWk5VRWhGYjJ0WGNsRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x838455223f0a5b64!3m1!1s2@1:CAIQACodChtycF9oOm16ejB0TEZFWWNzTTZNUEhFb2tXclE%7C0cQpRRfvrbj%7C?hl=en","114869840214107566852","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWljtWy-bLulvtURBoRY23iKiOAJdWCaTiEMoXf-vbTp7B_jVk5=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114869840214107566852?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Teacher Jerome's lively and interesting explanation gave us as parents a deeper understanding of the little champions' learning in school. It also let us know how we can help the little champions practice at home👍
Today's parent-child activities were fun and enhanced our relationship. Thank you teachers for your enthusiastic support for this activity. It is very meaningful.

"MindChamps PreSchool @ Punggol Digital District","5","A big thank you to the dedicated team at MindChamps PreSchool @ Punggol for organising such a meaningful and engaging Parents’ Day event! It was heartwarming to see the thoughtful effort put into creating an experience that allowed parents and children to connect, explore, and learn together.

The team is constantly on high energy, has a fun-loving spirit, and has positive vibes that shine daily.  Your creativity and warmth make a huge difference—not just on special occasions but in the champs' daily lives. No wonder my champ looks forward to going to school every day ❤️","2025-06-06T05:35:42.267Z","0","Terle Tart","1","false",,,"en","2 months ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VNaXo1XzdybWF6ZzB3RRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VNaXo1XzdybWF6ZzB3RRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x838455223f0a5b64!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEMiz5_7rmazg0wE%7CCgsIrvyJwgYQ-Kncfw%7C?hl=en","102554814848606354822","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocI19V5X6xDQ4tCQRvAHkYs54BGbjUv6kaLRjjA6uc5bxn_Rfg=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102554814848606354822?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"MindChamps PreSchool @ Punggol Digital District","5","My girl loves her school at Mindchamps Punggol Northshore. She looks forward to seeing her teachers and her classmates everyday. We always see lots of energy and bright smiles from the teachers and school team! This is so assuring as we know our little one is in good hands. Thanks Ms Veron, Chai Laoshi, Ms Lara, Nana Laoshi, Ms Katherine, Me Jerome, Mr Calvin, Ms Regina, Ms Hanah and all MC Punggol team for making her school experience so enjoyable.

The school organises many fun events like Family Fiesta, learning journey outings, year end musical concert, centre open house experience day etc. The classrooms are so very lovely. We are all impressed by the thoughts that Ms Lara and Nana Laoshi put in for the creative classroom design!

We also greatly appreciate the assistant teachers and the school team's behind-the-scene support in taking care of the Champs. Hui Hui Laoshi does wonders with girls' hair braids (she can totally do a workshop on this!). Sheryl, Hui Yi and Mui Hong are always responsive when we need information. Last but not least, a big thanks to Ms Veron and Chai Laoshi for their passion, dedication and leadership. With principals who love children and education, plus a great team who share the same passion, we believe we will have many more memorable moments for our girl's pre-school journey with MindChamps Punggol.","2025-06-05T07:57:39.953Z","0","Ningzhen Ruan","2","false",,,"en","Edited 2 months ago",,"ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5MEtqMHhRRRAB",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5MEtqMHhRRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x838455223f0a5b64!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIC90Kj0xQE%7C0cFJrnsom6M%7C?hl=en","116806640312975441881","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXH6AIThB6jh2HZX8DKU4nX2--VHf9-MZILEVM2IFqoO2egvd3K=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116806640312975441881?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Grace Child Development Centre","1","Reason: Arbitrary rules by this school.
Dont allow both parents to have a school visit to decide (even they disallowed 1 parent come another day).

Arbitrary rules for mask:
Even after there being no mask mandates by govt, the school force us to wear mask when we went to visit. (While Principal and some teachers were not wearing)

Principal doesn't even spare 2 mins of time to discuss or talk with us when we visit to decide for admission.And she is not teaching or attending any other person. Shows how much they care. Zero.

Unhealthy air. Its enclosed space with continuous room freshner running and emitting chemical toxins in air. Was hard to stand for 5 mins at the reception. Wonder how it effects children studying there.

Overall the place seems unwelcoming and not a nurturing environment for toddlers or young kids.","2024-02-27T02:26:23.626Z","0","Vaibhav Jain","14","true",,,"en","a year ago",,"ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkczR6eWFnEAE",,,,"Google","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkczR6eWFnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x1361bfacfbc795e!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDds4zyag%7CCgwIz5D1rgYQgIboqgI%7C?hl=en-GB","112797151885394037552","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKKPoEPe41oVtbM2DyUhnuX39ilwgYRX7X6t2NeuCXevyIXwdI=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112797151885394037552?hl=en-GB",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mainly let the kids do simple art and go for playground within the building.
