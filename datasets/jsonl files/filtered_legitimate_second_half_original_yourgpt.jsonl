The school has a strong focus on instilling values like responsibility, independence and beliefs about environmental sustainability from an early age, and the children are constantly engaged in activities that foster creativity, imaginative play, and speech expression. The Friday pool time is always a highlight for the children!\n\nClass sizes are small, allowing each child to receive individualised attention. The schoolâ€™s facilities are also excellent â€” with many varied spaces that ensure a rich and diverse learning experience. We also appreciate the frequent updates from the teachers regarding our childrenâ€™s behaviour and progress, keeping us closely connected to their learning journey.\n\nOne instance that reflected the schoolâ€™s dedication to safety was when a teacher immediately flagged my helper who was not careful when crossing the road with my child.\n\nOur elder child, who was initially hyperactive, was nurtured with patience by caring teachers like Teacher Muna and Su Laoshi. Thanks to their support, he gradually learnt to settle down and thrive in a classroom environment. Numeracy and literacy were also very well covered; we never had to send our boys for additional enrichment classes like I Can Read or Berries. The Chinese spelling list was challenging though. Both my boys developed a strong foundation that prepared them well for primary school.\n\nWhat truly sets Sheffield Kidsworld (St Anne) apart is Mr Puhal, the principal. He knows each and every child by heart and is always eager to share his teaching philosophy and suggestions with parents. It has been a privilege to have placed both our sons under his leadership and care. We highly recommend Sheffield Kidsworld (St Anne) to any parent seeking a nurturing, high-quality early education for their child.","review_date":"2025-04-27T06:48:50.455Z","category":"education"}

Although the agent was responsive and tried to salvage the situation, the quality of the nannies are really poor.\n\nFirst nanny - obsessed with her phone (did not turn off notification sounds), did not burp baby sufficiently resulting in frequent vomiting, used phone while taking care of baby. Unhygienic practices of letting bb drink unfinished formula milk after 1-2 hours. Complained to us about her pay and helped herself to our food w/o asking.\n\n(Add on a point on the vomiting, apart from over-feeding that resulted in frequent vomiting (projectile vomit, not spitting milk), it was established that the nanny didnâ€™t burp the baby sufficiently which resulted in baby vomiting in her sleep. Now, this is dangerous. The vomiting part is still manageable. Vomiting in sleep is not acceptable!)\n\nReplacement nanny - not trained in confinement (machiam like housewife). cannot wash anything clean (milk bottles were oily after she washed). cooked about less than 1l of red dates tea for me initially and had to tell her to cook more. prepare herbal bath one time and use for 2 days (the herbal water kept till smelly). Complained about us over the phone and kena caught because we could hear from baby monitor. Food was the same everyday, tasteless sometimes and very repetitive. She cooks the same few veggie, chicken and rarely fish. Husband asked her what fish to buy she told us to ask the fish monger. Dismissed her finally because she gave bb formula milk every hour during the night shift because she didn't know why baby was crying and kept feeding bb milk.\n\nBoth nannies do not know how to update logs - time, amount of feeding, time of poop etc.\n\nThese are just some of the issues highlighted.

The atmosphere at the school radiates warmth and positivity, making it a nurturing environment for children. It's reassuring as parents to know that our child is in such capable hands.\n\nThe school's curriculum and activities have also contributed to our son's growth. Through the pictures and videos shared on the school's application, we can see that he has daily playground sessions and afternoon language sessions, where he is exposed to Mandarin. It's truly impressive that he is already able to speak some Mandarin sentences.\n\nMy son's love for the school extends beyond the classroom. He often recites the songs he learns at school, especially the phonics songs, when he's at home and even before going to sleep. This demonstrates the positive impact the school's teachings have on his learning and enjoyment.\n\nLastly, we appreciate the monthly field trips organized by the school, which allow us as parents to tag along.

Even small 7eleven store cashiers are better than these lazy staff.\n\nI bought a camera here that will be used as a gift. No one was around to help, so I went to the cashier area and asked someone to sell the item to me. I specifically asked if the item I will be buying can be returned as I don't want to open the box since it will be a gift I will give on my overseas trip. The guy who helped me said it could be returned after 14 days. I counted my overseas trip days, and if ever there is a defect, I can still return it after my trip.\n\nArmed with this info, I immediately paid for the item. When I double-checked with the cashier about the return policy, much to my surprise, he said the item only has a 1 week return policy. I argued that they falsely provided sales terms and misled me into buying the item. As a compromise, I asked if they could test it instead, though I am hesitant since I want the box sealed when I give my gift - but to add to the incompetence so far, they said they don't have a dedicated salesperson who can test it.\n\nSince they have no solutions for me and we just stared at each other for minutes with no one offering even a simple apology, much less a work around the issue, I just opted to refund the item.\n\nWhen the person who will process my refund came and asked the guy if I would need a refund, the guy even had the gall to tell her I changed my mind. I didn't let it pass since they are the one who changed the terms of sale right there, not me. Stores usually get sued and fined for this kind of misleading sales, but the staff are not even bothered by the mistake and incompetence they just displayed. In any other setup, this kind of attitude leads to suspension or even dismissal, but I guess Courts Orchard management is satisfied with being mediocre and incompetent.","review_date":"2025-02-26T15:34:22.297Z","category":"retail"}

{"company_name":"Samsung Experience Store","stars":"1","text":"On 10 April 2024, visited the store to fix Zfold4 screen protector lifting off in the middle in less than a year since purchase. Had to pay $30 for a new screen protector as I am not sure if we can do it elsewhere without negating the warranty. It would be free with Samsung Care.\n\nThe service was prompt without long queue, fixed within an hour. However, the fix came with a big disclaimer - there will be no warranty on the new protector even if bubbles develop within a few days. What kind of confidence is that coming from the brand?\n\nAs a long time user of Samsung for more than a decade, it is appreciated that a free protector was given with the phone. However, to see that the cover failed within a year, I can't help but cast doubts over the longer term reliability of ZFold4. What if the screen starts to crack after the warranty period? I have S8 that is still usable but it would seem that fancy ZFold4 may not last as long.\n\nRecommended to consider Samsung Care.\n\n10 May 2024 - sadly another visit to fix Z Fold 4 is needed. Inner display stopped working. Still within warranty but it is a waste of time. Samsung Care can't be added. Sent in 11am, collected before 4pm. Excellent working condition for now. But 1 Yr warranty expiring next month, can the phone last another year even? Explore trade in options? Clearly fold design  is far from reliable.\n\n5 June 2025: Samsung Z Fold 4 inner screen sudden death! I have used Samsung phones since 2013, even the S8 is still working without issues. How can Samsung sell fold phones that are so unreliable!? It is so expensive to fix it.\n\nAugust 2025. Pink line across the outer screen. Let's see how bad can zfold4 ends up.","review_date":"2025-08-22T11:01:15.718Z","category":"retail"}

I had earlier cancelled my screen repair arrangement with MisterMobile due to time constraints as I went ahead for another shop to get my phone screen repaired quickly. However, the lcd screen from tht shop did not last even a week and cracked quickly. I felt completely hopeless and by sheer luck thats when Mister Mobile contacted me and checked me if my phone is ok and told that my new lcd screen has arrived and if i needed any help despite my earlier request to cancel my order with them. I was humbled by how they went beyond the mile to check if my phone still needed a repair. I went ahead with them this time on 20.8.25 at 7pm and was not disappointed. I was attended by two frontline young chaps who were calm and pleasant. Both took utmost care with my phone during the procedures. One was wearing glasses and he did the pre-checks while patiently informing me each time he did anything on the phone. Repair was done on the spot with abt 2 hour waiting. Post-check was done by the second young chap with a stylish hair and nice voice. He made sure my phone and its internal components were all fine. Even cleaned the phone well. Now my phone is working fine and the quality of the lcd is supreme. Thanks MisterMobile!! Definitely a very reliable outlet at Hougang.

As a result, I always feel that my quads fatigue all the time during and after rides and keep getting dropped on climbs.\n\nAfter I went for my first Retul Fit by Mr Ironman Jack, found out that my saddle was way too low, saddle wrong size and stem too low (wanna act pro I go and slam) hence affecting my pedaling efficiency, comfort and overall ride quality.\n\nThe fit was done according to Retul recommended stats and or course with Jackâ€™s experience and adjustments, I went for 2 50+ KM rides with moderate and high intensity. Immediately noticed that Iâ€™m way comfortable, average power has increased with little to no leg fatigue even after a hard ride I went home with no cramps or pains and I no longer feel the burning sensation on my quads during inclines or climb.\n\nI highly recommend.

{"company_name":"Line Stationery Gifts & Toys","stars":"2","text":"Line stationery has always been my go-to store. A place where I'd travel to happily to get my pens, refills and other miscellaneous items. Most of the time, I would go there for their printing services.\n\nI am usually graced by the very friendly uncle who would not only do a good job at helping me print my stuffs but also gave me cheaper rate (because he knows I'm a student). Today, I experienced one of the most unsettling encounter with a lady who works there.\n\nWhen I told her that I wanted to print some stuffs, she handed me the blue laptop for me to do it on my own - saying \"you can do on your own right?\" - which surprised me because that's not how the uncle does it. When the laptop was booting up, she ignored me and started chatting away with what seems to be a colleague/ a friend. Not that I mind, but the account was locked out and she didn't even bother to tell me that the password can be found on the paper that was sticked onto the laptop. \"It's there what?\" + pointing at the paper without any apology was what I had as a response when I told her that the account was locked.  But what irked me alot was the look she gave - the look that I should have known it was there and those eyes which seemingly said please do not bother me any further.\n\nI am also disappointed that she couldn't help me further with the printing because I was unsure with the printing layout - which she could only solve by calling her boss. And right after that, she wanted to charge me for 18 pieces instead of 9 because she didn't bother to count until I told her to.\n\nCustomer experience is what drives customer loyalty. I had a very bad experience here.","review_date":"2021-10-08T04:43:16.319Z","category":"retail"}

The comfort. I wore them straight out of the box for a pre-wedding photoshoot and was genuinely surprised at how comfortable they were. No break-in period needed at all! The leather padded insole and quality lining make a huge difference, and I didnâ€™t get any of the usual pinching or soreness you sometimes get with new Oxfords.\n\nIf youâ€™re looking for a pair of classic, well-made dress shoes that look sharp and feel great from day one, I highly recommend giving these a try.

I had a bad experience at HipVan earlier on as I was ignored by the only staff there so it was a delightful change at STAR living. When my mum and I first walked into the store, we immediately liked what we saw. The dining tables were modern and stylish, and the pricing was surprisingly affordable. CK was extraordinary because he gave us a lot of inputs and suggestions when we felt unsure which chair to pick that would go with the dining table. CK took time to explain about each design's different quality and material. It was obvious that he had a lot of experience. I ended up getting a sofa bed, a dining table and chairs, and two office chairs. Another benefit of coming to Star Living is that it shares its premises with King Koil, so it's a one-stop shop for those who want to buy beds and mattresses as well. Candy, the sales lady at King Koil, was also very delightful and sweet. It's too bad that I already bought a King Koil bed elsewhere 2 days ago. STAR Living has won me over!

{"company_name":"Smartbed Signature @ Serangoon","stars":"1","text":"I had a terrible experience purchasing a bed frame from SmartBed's Signature @ Serangoon outlet, and I want to warn others about the poor service I received from their salesperson, Malvin.\n\nI ordered a king-size sit in bed frame, which was clearly discussed multiple times with Malvin at the store. My mattress at home is a king size, so there was no reason to order anything smaller. However, when he wrote up the sales order, he inexplicably noted it as a 5ft frameâ€”which, unbeknownst to me at the time, is a queen size. As customers, how are we supposed to know these technical details like \"5ft\" equals queen? Malvin even reviewed the sales order with us and referred to it as a king-size bed frame, so we trusted him.\n\nOn the delivery day, a queen-size bed frame was delivered instead of the king size we agreed on. When I confronted Malvin about this error, he refused to take responsibility for his mistake. Instead of offering a proper resolution or compensation, he suggested that I buy a queen-size mattress at their \"cost price\" to solve the issue. How am I supposed to know what their actual cost price is? This was their mistake, and yet Iâ€™m expected to spend more money to fix it?\n\nThe bed frame is a sit-in bed, meaning the mattress sits inside the frame itself. This makes the problem even worse because my king-size mattress now doesnâ€™t fit properly in the queen-size bed frame.\n\nThe worst part is that I had asked my interior designer to build side tables based on the measurements Malvin provided for the queen-size bed frame. Now, my bed frame doesnâ€™t fit with my king-size mattress, and my renovation is already completed with no way to adjust. His carelessness has completely disrupted my plans and left me with a mess that I have to figure out how to fix.\n\nThis situation has been incredibly frustrating, and I wouldnâ€™t want anyone else to go through what I did. If youâ€™re buying a bed frame or mattress from SmartBed, please make sure the salesperson writes down \"king\" or \"queen\" explicitly on the sales order. Donâ€™t rely on verbal agreements or trust them to get it right.\n\nLesson learned for me, but I will never shop at SmartBed again.","review_date":"2024-12-23T02:23:32.962Z","category":"retail"}

{"company_name":"T For Toys - Toy Store","stars":"5","text":"We visited T for Toys based on the impressive Google reviews and weren't disappointed. More than a mere toy warehouse, it emerges as a meticulously organised and clean haven for children and parents alike. My visit on 30th Sept, revealed rows of neatly stacked, individually packed toys, all maintained in a temperature-controlled environment, ensuring quality preservation.\n\nThe staff, particularly Auntie Monica (hope I got her name right), deserve a special mention for not only being knowledgeable about the products but also for engaging and entertaining my kids with intriguing toys, allowing me to consult what to buy comfortably with my wife over the phone. The toys, while not your typical branded products, are of commendable quality, offering a wide array of options from wooden fruits to high-quality plastic homeware, costumes to educational STEM sets, and more. We departed with a handful including kitchen sets, wash basins, medical sets, tea sets and more, much to the kids delight. The only gripe is the purchase process, where you'll still need to visit their website to select, check out and pay. While it does take some time, we weren't in a rush and the staff were helpful throughout.\n\nT for Toys is a unique and delightful shopping experience, with well-categorised toys and easy aisles. House brands dominate the store, giving the it a similar experience to a Decathlon but for toys. Definitely recommendable for quality, variety, and exceptional service!

Horrible. She thought by doing so she could right her wrong.

{"company_name":"Novena (Tampines)","stars":"1","text":"Worse place to get furnitures. Somewhere during April, i purchased a queen size bed and wardrobe and was attended by this sales person Julie. After purchasing, she informed that there was no stock for the bed in the warehouse at that moment and I would had to wait till early June. Didnâ€™t have the decency to inform before i paid for it so i had no choice but to agree. During early june, there was no news about it. I had to constantly keep calling her instead of her calling me to update. All i got was â€œthe stock havenâ€™t arrived yet. I call my manager then update u again.â€ Still, no update from her. After that, i had called her multiple times and asked for a refund and i was told â€œsorry we cannot refund uâ€. Hence i called the main office n i was told the same thing â€œno stock now. We donâ€™t know when will arriveâ€â€¦ what is this??? After 2 weeks, still no update from anyone. Hence, i emailed in to the customer care service and there was no reply as well. After multiple emails n saying that I would bring this matter up to CASE, finally they replied and finally Julie called. Telling me that she â€œHELPEDâ€ me to negotiate with her manager to exchange the bed frame to a more expensive one. When the goods finally arrived, there were some defects on my wardrobe door. Again, i was told to wait for the replacement door. And now, they said the replacement part has arrived and they have to bring back that defect door to replace the aluminium part instead of replacing the whole door for me (which was told to me initially). Never again will I buy stuffs from Novena Tampines anymore and I would not recommend any of my family and friends to go there.

Finished product (wood slabs) was good, not amazing, but decent for the price. Storage hydraulic is a little jerky, but overall the bed offers significant storage, though it may not be practically accessible given how heavy a king mattress will be on top - so the 2 small drawers design is useful.\n\nBut the online website and sales process needs improvement. The website is misleading, it shows choice of colors and size that may already be discontinued or out of stock. Expect some conversation with customer service.\n\nThere is shipment tracking but product came from China via sea freight so between the factory production time, any inclement weather and customs clearance, be prepared to wait a bit for your purchase.

We got angry and told them we wont go anywhere and we waited there till they finished. Only then did they do it and finish all 3 books in 10mins. So its not a matter of long or not.

I walked away as it was too expensive and did not accept the offer because they did not seek my consent with the pricing before printing. Under contract law, I am not legally bound to pay for papers they printed without my agreement.\n\nAdditionally, the shop appeared to be run by a group of young Malaysians who seemed to be secondary school students, based on their accents and appearance.

{"company_name":"POPULAR Bookstore","stars":"1","text":"I approached an Indian lady staff member and told her I wanted to exchange two Harry Potter books for other items, as I had bought the wrong ones. I specifically mentioned that the books were from the NEX outlet, and she nodded, confirming it was okay.\n\nAt around 3:04 PM, I selected multiple products worth $29.91 and returned to the same staff member to process the exchange. I clearly stated, â€œI want to exchange the Harry Potter books for these items.â€ She acknowledged this and called an older woman for assistance.\n\nThe older woman informed me that opened books (one of mine had its plastic packaging removed) could not be exchanged in the future. She then repeatedly asked if these were the books I wanted to exchange, and I confirmed. She instructed me to get another first Harry Potter book, which I assumed was for scanning purposes, so I retrieved a sealed copy.\n\nAfter scanning both books, she calculated the total as $29.91. Everything seemed fine until she asked the Indian staff member to complete the transaction. However, instead of processing the exchange, the Indian lady scanned all my items and charged me for them. I paid without realizing the mistake and then asked, â€œWait, if this is an exchange, shouldnâ€™t I not be paying?â€\n\nShe called back the older woman, who became visibly irritated and snapped, â€œI asked you multiple times if these were the books you wanted to exchange. You said you bought the wrong book and wanted to exchange it for the one you brought me.â€\n\nAt this point, my friend stepped in and clarified, â€œSheâ€™s here to exchange the books she bought from NEX for other products here.â€ The older woman suddenly realized her mistakeâ€”despite me having mentioned earlier that the books were from NEX. She had not understood this and had assumed I only wanted to swap the books for different editions. Frustrated, she grabbed the Harry Potter book and threw it into a basket before processing my refund.\n\nHer tone then became calmer, but the items I had chosen did not add up exactly to $29.91, so my friend and I had to pick out additional candy to match the amount. Despite adding two sweets, the total was still short, and the older woman, now visibly annoyed, signaled her frustration to the Indian lady.\n\nEventually, we selected four sweets, bringing the total to $30.21, requiring me to pay an extra $0.30. Even after completing the transaction, the older woman continued displaying attitude and signaling her irritation.\n\nplease educate staff on importance of respect and dignity; make sure they have the ability to communicate and process misunderstandings without lashing out at members of the public.","review_date":"2025-03-24T08:12:03.461Z","category":"retail"}

After buying the Behemoth chair for my home, I decided to buy the same for the office but in black this time.

I did  a lot of research as I was afraid that the table would not be at the height I wanted. I needed one at the office as I just went for spinal surgery and I was told I should not be sitting down too long daily and to get a standing deck.\nWell, the day came and after a quick installation, the table and chair are now my best friends at work. I can quickly transition from sitting and standing with my presets and did I mention it is virtually noiseless?\nSo i now have 3 APOL products and I am a fan for life.

This is very dissapointing from your assurance you will write back to me.\n____________________________________\nAfter my above updated comment(20th June), I called up and spoke to Nurul and  was told she is still waiting for the Com. Side to revert. That means as a consumer being told to give them a few days  but no email and I have to assume they will eventually get back to me, whenever that will be. So no need from their side to update me the status, but just wait and wait and wait till I forget?\nPuma, JD and other sports retail outlets are so on top of their game. This is a small issue that can be resolved in a matter of minutes.\nManagememt of Adidas, I told Nurul, I give you two more days  to revert.

{"company_name":"Toys\"R\"Us - Waterway Point","stars":"1","text":"I would give zero stars to this Toys\"R\"Us. The staff, especially the on shift manager's performance needs to be reviewed by the senior management. If Toysrus as a global brand does not offer gift wrapping or has no stock of wrapping paper, then there should be a big sign and the cashiers should inform this to the customers before the item is bought. Not once the payment is made and then tell them. This seems like a ploy to take the money and then not offer a refund when the customer has been fooled about a typical service which should be offered (has been as well) by one of the biggest gift retailers globally. Even when I went out to buy a wrapper from kiddy palace and returned to request them to wrap it, they refused the service. So shame on you, it's a lie then that you're out of stock of wrapping paper, the truth is, you just simply don't want to wrap gifts. Therefore, you should make this clear as it will define the customers choice or weather or not to patronise your merchandise.","review_date":"2024-12-29T05:50:38.442Z","category":"retail"}

{"company_name":"Mister Mobile (City Plaza)","stars":"1","text":"1. Waiting time too long. If you are going to have a reservation service, then be truthful to it. Even if you reserve a time slot, you have to wait in a queue. The queue is confusing, and people come in and cut the queue because they are unsure about where to queue.\n2. Incompetent staff. I have to be the one correcting them. They don't have information immediately and have to check their ipad repeatedly. While speaking, other staff interrupt our conversations regarding doubts, don't they all have the same experience? Can't they resolve problems by themselves?\n3. Trade in prices are poor and old. Wanted to trade in a basically new phone for a used but pristine phone. Bought phone for 1300. Will get up to 750 if trading in opened and activated within 14 days. Okay sure I thought to myself even though it was almost half the original price because of a phone I wanted which was 850 pristine used. Upon giving it. They say it's used and come down to 650. What nonsense. That other phone I want is also used and it's only going for 1000 brand new online same with my phone which also goes for 1000+ online. 650 for a flagship phone that was opened and activated under 14 days and is purely clean with no marks scuffs etc and 848 for a phone that is 4 months old, with mild wear and tear and has only a few months of warranty left is poor pricing given the price you can get these phones for brand new. Update your trade in prices and used phone prices keeping in mind the cost of the phones brand new. Was looking forward to getting that phone so much so that I was willing to accept the 848 asking price. But trade in of 650 for a practically new phone is upsetting.\n4. Asked sales rep to get manager to discuss this. Sales rep says just keep your phone. Did I ask? And If I wanted to why would I come to this store. Once rep went to get manager, manager is apparently so busy that he used this sales rep as a messenger to go back and forth.  Manager must be busier than Tim Cook.\n5. I was appalled by this lack of support and service and that I couldn't get the device I wanted.\n6. I gave one star just for your repair services. You only charge for the repair if you can properly diagnose and fix the issue. I didn't test this but other positive reviews support it.\n7. Negotiation is non existent. They follow fixed prices made up by some other department that clearly doesn't know the value of devices. They have no empathy either, I came a long way to this outlet just for that phone. If I am buying a used device or selling a device, I have to give my opinions and reasoning. If it makes sense then you have to do something to please the customer.\nIn an overview, You lost a potential lifelong customer. Only come here if you want to either be disappointed or repair your phone. Thanks for taking time to read my review. Phone to trade in - Find X8, Phone I wanted to get - Honor Magic 7 Pro.","review_date":"2025-08-20T09:45:51.566Z","category":"retail"}

{"company_name":"Mister Mobile (Bukit Panjang)","stars":"2","text":"I got my S22 ultra screen replaced with Mister Mobile at Bukit Panjang earlier in January this year as I dropped it. Repair went well and paid $278 and I was told to avoid water contact as it is no longer IP68 rated which is fair advice given.\nAbout 7 months later, the screen started glitching, colors were washed out and phone cannot be set to 120hz refresh rate or it would glitch crazily which I needed to use screen mirroring to reset to 60hz. Brought it down to the same branch to understand why a Grade A screen would fail after less than a year. Tried to show the staff the issue I'm facing and one glance he says it'll cost $268 to fix without examining the phone.\nI said I got this replaced here and wanted to know why is it glitching so badly. The response was all Samsung phones are known to have this issue and screens are known to fail after awhile. I wish they had given a disclaimer when they replaced my screen in January to anticipate a failure down the road in a year's time, maybe I would have just put that money into a new phone. Before I dropped my phone, original screen was fine and had no green lines or glitches.\nBy then I've heard enough, thanked him and walked away dissapointed. I guess I'm posting here just as a heads up to people looking to replace their Samsung LCD screens not to expect too much longevity, I've got seven months out of it, maybe you could do better than me.","review_date":"2025-08-23T14:31:32.685Z","category":"retail"}

Service was pretty good, they were fast and responsive, and upfront about potential issues.\n\nThe repair quality is a bit suspect though - the phone exterior wasn't in great condition to begin with, but it's much worse now. ðŸ˜… Lots of glue protruding from different parts, and some scrapes and chipping where it was pried apart. When I open it there's also a slight creasing sound and the closing doesn't look quite right. I still got charged full price for the repair.\n\nBut the cable has been fixed and it works! They provide only a 30-day warranty for this, compared to the 90-day for their other repairs, so I will see how long this lasts.\n\nEdit: Dropped a star because their response is quite disingenuous. The screen was damaged prior, but the exterior was totally fine -- and from the photos you can see now that it's quite a mess. That was their doing.\n\nA month on and the phone is holding up all right, but the hinge is a bit wobbly and probably will not last long.

I noticed with there's tons of energy (and noise) from the people looking to have a drink and good bite to eat. 1 Star.\n\nService - There was no wait for a table at 5:30 on a Monday. The dining room wasn't full when I arrived; however, it was packed by the time we left. Our server was very attentive and gave several great recommendations from the menu. He checked in a few times and even checked this out right at the table. 1 Star.\n\nFood - I started with the Pork Confit Fries.  WOW.  The tender braised pork sat on a bed of seasoned fries while a generous portion of cheese blanketed both. When I took a bite that included all three - It was simply delicious.  Salty. Tender. Cheesy. Delicious. For my main dish, I had the Double Smashed American Burger.  It tasted like a Double Double from In-n-Out except with caramelized onions and more beef. In other words, it was better than I could even imagine. Each bite led to a beautiful juicy mess. Perfection. 2 Stars.\n\nWill I Return? - Yes.  My hotel concierge recommended that I try Von's for their burger (and they're open until 2 AM). At first I was skeptical; however, I'm glad I went because it turned out I had one of the best meals in Seattle here.  1 Star.","review_date":"15/3/2025","category":"Food & Beverage"}

If you were to pick up a slice with one hand it'd flop down and all the toppings would fall off so you have to kinda balance it. But it def hit the spot regardless.

Being two Bay Area girls, we're more than familiar with sourdough--so we were excited!\n\nThe restaurant is super casual with a relaxed atmosphere. There is a long bar with a variety of spirits, hence the name. Plenty of tables inside to sip and dine, plus outdoor dining is available. It's a popular spot being close to Pike Place and near the water. I found the service to be a bit stiff and with a bit of a cold shoulder. \n\nSourdough is the bread and butter of this restaurant, you can see it being made at the front. You can find sourdough pasta, pizzas, sandwiches, and so many more local offerings. I knew I had to try their Basil Almond Pesto Sourdough Pasta, which I got without ChÃ¨vre Cheese and added Hot Fennel Sausage. The amount of pasta was generous but I felt there wasn't as much sausage. The pasta itself was delicious--the perfect chew, coated the sauce nicely, and the tomatoes provided a burst of color and flavor. My best friend had the Tellicherry Chicken and Gouda and enjoyed it! \n\nVon's knows how to lure you in with comfort and cozy food with a Seattle twist.

We had about a 30 minute wait, which was not bad considering it was a busy Friday evening.\n\nI'm not sure if I want to give this place another chance or not.  I will admit that the food was pretty good.  I had the Cuban sandwich, and it was delicious.  I also had a champagne mango margarita, which was also very good.\n\nHowever, our visit was absolutely destroyed by the service provided by our server.  She made it very clear many times verbally, that she did not want to be working this evening.  Her attitude showed that as well.\n\nThe first odd thing is that she came by with water less than a minute after we sat down and she profusely apologized for the excessive long wait, which we found really odd.  Then that is the first time she went into the fact that they called her in, because someone else called out this evening and she is \"out of it\" and \"tired\" and \"didn't want to be working\".   She just kept telling us this over and over and over.  We didn't need to know any of this.\n\nOne of the people in our party ordered the Basil Almond Pesto and added the \"Fennel Sausage\".  Later when it came out, it didn't have any sausage in it.  We inquired with her, and told her that there was no need for it; however, we wanted to make sure it wasn't on the bill.   She suddenly went into a whole rant about \"Are you mad at me now?\".  \"I don't want you to be mad at me\".   \"Are you sure you aren't mad at me?\".  It was just too much.\n\nWe were then presented with the Toast thing to pay our bill.  I asked for a printed copy of the receipt, because I couldn't see the detail on the bill (I don't believe we were charged properly).  She said, that she would have to get her manager for a copy of the receipt, because I wanted to see it before I left instead of emailing it to myself.  She left and never returned, even waiting 10 minutes before leaving the table after paying.  \n\nThis was just a terribly odd experience.","review_date":"31/5/2025","category":"Food & Beverage"}

The server brought over a handheld Toast point-of-sale machine, took each of our cards, and immediately presented the tip screen (with 18%, 20%, and 22% pre-calculated options) before showing us an itemized bill.\n\nI tipped 20% and then asked for a printed receipt. That's when I noticed a separate line item called \"Cook Commission - 5%\" added to the pre-tip total. This meant my actual tip ended up being 25% -- but I had no idea at the time because I wasn't shown the bill beforehand.\n\nAt every other restaurant I've been to, you're shown an itemized check first so you know the exact charges before deciding on a tip. Here, we were essentially tipping \"blind\" without being told about the extra 5% charge.\n\nI find this practice non-transparent and, in my opinion, unethical.

{"company_name":"Colony","stars":"5","text":"This buffet was worth every dollar spent!\n\nMy wife and I celebrated our 1 year anniversary (and part of our honeymoon) at Colony and it was everything I read about it and more. Buffets are typically unattractive gorge-fest atmospheres filled with gluttony and sloppiness everywhere, but Colony puts a whole new spin on it. The restaurant puts other buffets to shame, adding a major touch of classiness and romanticism to it all.\n\nThe restaurant is located in the Ritz-Carlton hotel and can easily be found in the lobby. Customers are first greeted by the Patisserie section, with its delectable collection of pastries and desserts, before making their way onto the dining area. After a quick glance, one might even want to skip straight to dessert -- that is, until they lay their eyes on one of the other 6 sections of the buffet.\n\nBesides the Patisserie, there's the following sections, which are all connected to one another:\n\nICE BAR - Jumbo shrimp cocktail, snow crab legs, raw oysters, mussels, craw fish, sashimi, sushi, etc.\nGRILL & ROTISSERIE - Grilled ham, brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes, sausage, squash, kale, etc.\nSTEAM BASKET - Steamed dim sum, buns, ready to made hot pot food, fish balls, noodles, etc.\nWOK - Chinese/Malay cuisine, such as, steamed fish, chili crab, fried rice, prawns, ribs, vermicelli, etc.\nTANDOOR - Indian cuisine, such as, various curries, basmati rice, etc.\nFRUIT STALL - Juices and whole fruits\n\nI probably did not come close to naming every single food that was served in each section, but it should give any hungry person an idea prior to walking in. I can't fit a comment here on every single item, but to summarize, the seafood was extremely fresh, the sushi was great for a buffet, the hot foods from the Chinese/Malay/Indian cuisine sections were very tasty. We didn't find a single thing wrong with anything we ate. By far the most attractive section though was the Patisserie. The assortment of pastries and little desserts here and there were fantastic and any dessert lover's dream. It really gave us the opportunity to sample away because they were small enough.\n\nYes, the buffet is $88 per adult for dinners .. and it's totally worth it with the amazing selection and chill atmosphere. Buffets aren't typically thought of as date restaurants, but Colony really redefines what a buffet is. On top of it all, our waiter was excellent. He knew we were here for our honeymoon and even gave us a quick tour of the buffet when we arrived so we wouldn't get lost. The perfect buffet?

Despite the aging Ritz Carlton starting to appear more like an average Marriott than a Ritz, The Colony restaurant inside was a treat both in design and quality.\n\nStepping into this uniquely designed space, there is a sense of surprise and confusion. The confusion arises from the vastly dispersed food selections throughout, making the breakfast appear endless. The dividers, decorated with antiques and imagery of Singapore provide a museum like feel to what would otherwise be a buffet. Selections are very vast, making it difficult to make a decision. Every piece of the meal was amazing, with the exception of one dish, the chicken curry in the Malay section which was not prepared well and the chicken very dry.\n\nThe service was spectacular and the buffet selections even beat out The St Regis where we spent the last evening in Singapore.

There was a hidden option where you can ask for scallops on the half shell at the seafood section.  I guess they had a limited number and did not want everyone to just focus on that one item.

{"company_name":"Colony","stars":"5","text":"Nestled within the embrace of The Ritz-Carlton, Colony gracefully unfolds as an epicurean tapestry, weaving a symphony of flavors that tantalize the palate and captivate the senses.  Having garnered rave reviews, securing a reservation here akin to snagging a wishbone during the first bite of a Christmas turkey, bordered on the miraculous.  My last-minute serendipity, however, paved the way for an experience as extraordinary as the tales whispered of old.\n\nThe buffet itself was a symphony of culinary delights.  Glistening seafood, nestled on beds of crushed ice, beckoned with their briny allure, while a kaleidoscope of colorful salads promised an explosion of flavors.  Plump, jewel-toned cheeses and charcuterie slices of unparalleled finesse awaited alongside steaming baskets of dim sum.  For the more adventurous palates, aromatic curries whispered of faraway lands, their spice-laden warmth transporting diners to vibrant Indian bazaars.  Those seeking comfort found solace in bowls of freshly prepared pasta, each strand a canvas for vibrant sauces that sang with Italianate passion.  A noodle station offered comforting bowls of laksa, the rich coconut broth laced with the fragrant whisper of lemongrass, and steaming bowls of pho, the translucent rice noodles cradling slivers of succulent beef.\n\nAnd then, there was dessert. A veritable fantasia of sugary delights, it was a playground for the inner child.  Tarts, glistening like jewels, held secrets of citrus and cream.  Chocolate pralines, each a decadent bite, whispered promises of pure, unadulterated bliss.  Waffles, crisp and golden, awaited their baptism in a molten river of maple syrup, while onde-onde, those little orbs of chewy rice cake, offered a delightful textural contrast.  Cookies, macarons, pandan cake, and a kaleidoscope of other confections transformed the dessert station into a Willy Wonka wonderland for grown-ups.  Each bite was a tiny explosion of flavor, a testament to the pastry chef's artistry.\n\nOf course, no experience is flawless.  The tandoori turkey, while flavorful, did veer towards the drier side, a minor misstep in an otherwise flawless performance.  The dessert selection, while impressive, could have boasted a wider variety, as could the hot and seafood items.  But these were mere whispers of discontent, quickly drowned out by the resounding chorus of delight that played on my palate.\n\nAt 88 SGD, or roughly $68 USD, the buffet is an investment.  Add taxes and the ever-present nudge of gratuity, and you're looking at a cool 105 SGD, or $79 USD.  But for an experience that transcends mere sustenance, that elevates the act of eating to an art form, Colony is worth every penny.\n\nAnd as for the Ritz-Carlton itself, well, let's just say that its understated elegance might not quite live up to the opulent standards of its younger, flashier counterparts.  Think of it as a comfortable old shoe, well-worn but undeniably reliable, rather than a pair of sky-high stilettos that might leave you with blisters at the end of the night.\n\nIn the end, Colony's buffet may not be the undisputed champion of Singapore's smorgasbord scene.  That crown, for now, rests on the shimmering head of Rise at Marina Bay Sands.  But for a delightful, meticulously crafted, and utterly satisfying culinary journey, Colony stands tall, a testament to the fact that sometimes, the most exquisite experiences are found not in the grandest settings, but in the quiet corners, where passion and artistry weave their magic on a plate.","review_date":"1/1/2024","category":"Food & Beverage"}

There's also a pasta station - which makes a pretty good seafood miso carbonara (pretty uniquely tasty).  The western area isn't very good imho.

The color and presentation of food were not attractive. The worst is at the Chinese counter. The dim sum was terrible with no quality control. The texture of dim sum was either rubbery and the Sui Mai texture was soft and starchy with no prawn and meat texture. The Laksa noodles gravy does not taste like Laksa at all. The gravy was over cooked with a burnt taste.                                      The dessert counter was boring and there were no outstanding desserts at all. Just average quality with variety.

I realized nowadays 6stars hotel like Ritz Carlton, Fullerton, due to their reputation and good business , have ignored their initial brand promise to customers. They are sitting on their laurels because the numbers are good and get carried away with food quality and presentation of food. No use of providing wide variety of food, if as a six star hotel restaurants is unable to deliver a 6star professional attitude towards its operations in quality, presentation and innovation of the food offerings to your customers! I realized the so called 6 star hotel restaurants in Singapore cannot be compared with those in Thailand and Hong Kong! The owners of 6 star hotels needs to shake up the hotel management staff and constantly keep them in checked to deliver the brand promise and commitment to their customers !","review_date":"17/1/2019","category":"Food & Beverage"}

{"company_name":"Colony","stars":"4","text":"This is a review for a Sunday buffet brunch at Colony restaurant, main level of the Ritz Carlton. Formerly branded as the Greenhouse, the Ritz has put much thought and effort into reorganizing the buffet areas into a more consolidated and efficient operation. They've also changed the feel of the dining room by adding partition walls that display framed stock photos all with the theme: colonization.\n\nThe effect of the heavily used partition wall modules is that of a Pottery Barn store. The feel is that all of the framed photos are on display to sell. The only thing missing are the price tags. The Wall Modules break up the large space creating a more intimate dining experience. What is lost is the joy of people watching during the brunch. With the serving stations all moved to a remote (mostly hidden) location at the rear of the restaurant and the partition walls segmenting the space into smaller dining areas, the feel is not as good as the Greenhouse. \n\nThe wide spectrum of food offerings are enough to please any palette. Local, Indian, Western, Seafood, Cheese, Breads, Desserts, etc. In addition to the free flow champagne, bartenders are on duty to make Bloody Marys and Espresso Martinis. I had several of each and both were delicious.\n\nThe staff is friendly, well trained and attentive. Champagne glasses were always kept full, empty plates continually cleared, and Bloody Marys and Martinis delivered upon request. \n\nThe Good: Food Quality, Staff, Ambiance\n\nThe Bad: I'm not a fan of the maze-like new partition wall modules that detract from the grand architectural space and prefer the more open and spacious feel of the Greenhouse. Hands down, the Greenhouse was a much better brunch experience.\n\nThe Verdict: Colony is a prime player in the Singapore Sunday Brunch scene. Glad to have visited, but I think I'll wait for the bi-annual \"Super Brunch\" before returning.","review_date":"2/6/2016","category":"Food & Beverage"}

You won't find many pickles, but sausages, you will find, in plain bounty. Meet the juiciest sausages you'll have the greatest pleasure of eating, the ThÃ¼ringer, (Cheese, and without), Debreziener, and NÃ¼rnberger.

There's always room for their crispy pork knuckles. As big as two of your fists put together, this culinary delight is sure to send your taste buds into overdrive. Sink your teeth into the tenderness of the knuckles and be delighted by the unexpected juiciness that squirts out of the flesh.\n\nWash everything down with a mug of beer straight from their brewery and please don't be afraid to let out a belch - that's your stomach thanking you for all that food, glorious food.","review_date":"21/8/2012","category":"Food & Beverage"}

So when the fiancÃ© brought me here for my birthday, I was really excited. \n\nThey do have a wide array of cuts, and I loved that they brought over a giant platter and explained which cut was served for each dish. It made it easier to chose. Their meat was pretty good, though mine was a little over (asked for rare, but it was closer to medium rare/medium). Their red wine sauce was really good though! \n\nFrancis and I were a little over ambitious and thought we could finish a side of asparagus, oyster mushrooms, and onsen egg, but we couldn't. This side dish did taste a little strange though, still can't figure out why I didn't like it that much. \n\nDessert was average, the chocolate lava cake was slightly over baked so it didn't ooze out nicely. \n\nI wouldn't say I'm super disappointed, but I'd probably only go back there for the meat and the view.","review_date":"6/2/2017","category":"Food & Beverage"}
{"company_name":"Salt Grill & Sky Bar","stars":"3","text":"Salt Grill & Sky Bar offers decent food and decent service in an attractive venue with an exceptional view.  The venue and view lived up to expectations.  The food and service, unfortunately, only lived up to the rather low standards I have come to expect from restaurants on the top floor of tall buildings.  Don't get me wrong about this.  Their food and service were not bad at all but I was hoping for better.  \n\nNext time I want to treat guests to a nice view, I will take them to the Singapore Flyer and then take them to dinner at a great restaurant at ground level that can successfully compete based on the quality of its food rather than its views.\n\nBy the way, don't waste your money on the Spanish Ortiz anchovy appetizer.  The menu accurately states on that the anchovies are served in the tin with garlic bread but I assumed there would be some creativity involved.  There wasn't. Just an open tin of anchovies and some garlic bread.\n\nI'm one of those guys who is useless in the kitchen, but even I could have done that!","review_date":"12/2/2013","category":"Food & Beverage"}

The Afternoon Tea Platter costs $38++ per person, inclusive of a tea or coffee, or $53++ per person including a glass of G.H Mumm Champagne. It is available from 2.30pm to 4:45pm. The coffee is non refillable, while as for tea one could ask for refillable of hot water.\n\nThe afternoon tea platter consisted of \nCrostini, avocado, cherry tomato, olive,\nHam & turkey, beetroot, manchego, tortilla,\nSmoked salmon, cucumber, chive, crÃ¨me cheese on rye,\nChocolate & jam lamington,\nCoffee macaroon,\nTim tam chocolate tart,\nRed velvet cup cake,\nAnzac biscuit,\nCitrus marshmallow, and\nScones.\n\nThe tea set was nicely plated but I felt that it was a bit too overpriced for such little food.

Not sure if it was due to the fact that I was having a 3 years old boy with me at the time. We were seated far away from other customers and had difficulties getting the attention of the staff. As it was between lunch and dinner meal times, there was limited choices for a 3 years old. No children menu, so ended up ordering French fries ($11++) for him.

{"company_name":"Salt Grill & Sky Bar","stars":"4","text":"Restaurant Week lunch. I have always wanted to try the food at Salt Grill & Sky Bar but it is always full during restaurant week, well, except for this week. \n\nReason for 4 stars instead of 5 stars: \nThe experience was marred from the beginning when I saw the email on Tuesday (they sent it Sunday afternoon, but I didn't check email till Tuesday...some people are not chained by email :p) where it asked if I could change my dining time to 11.30 am or 11.45 am instead of 12 pm. The reason was due to the overwhelming response and so we will only have 1 hour 15 mins to dine if we come at 12 pm.\n\nThe question that pop into my head was \"didn't they already have a fix number of tables for Restaurant Week\"? and \"Why was this not indicated when making the booking?\" And this was not the first time Salt has participated in Restaurant Week, wouldn't they have known better on what to expect?\n\nIt is quite disconcerting to have to re-arrange our schedule just so we will not have a rushed lunch. In any case, we decided to change our reservations to 11.30 am. I got there just before 11.30 am and was told the restaurant was not ready as the staff are getting their briefing then. 2nd strike. I made the effort to be on time, and at the time suggested by the restaurant, I would expect to be granted the courtesy to be seated accordingly. Cooling my heels for a while, it was another 5-10 minutes later before I was finally shown to a table. \n\nThe \"3rd\" not so happy experience was very minor - I asked for a window table but I was told it was for non-restaurant week customers...that reason did not fly with me as a friend had the window table the day before and she was also dining on Restaurant Week menu. Anyway, that was really a minor thing but the whole pre-dining experience was enough to make me put Salt on the \"first and last time\" dining list. \n\n\nBack to the place and food:\n\nI like the simplicity of the place with its high ceiling and modern furnishing. Service was professional, attentive, polite and not overly friendly. What caught me by surprise was the basket the manager brought over for us to put our bags. That was thoughtful. \n\nWater was topped up without having to ask (they do ask if you want still or sparkling water, but you could request for warm or iced tap water at no extra cost), the courses were well paced  so we did not feel rushed. In the end we left slightly after 1.15 pm, but never once were we made to feel we had to hurry through the meal. So kudos to the service staff for making the actual dining experience to be enjoyable after all.\n\nRestaurant Week Menu:\nStarter - chicken liver foie gras parfait, truffled butter, toasted brioche. This was really superb. A generous serving of smooth pate in a small jar which went very well with the brioche and complimentary bread \n\nMain - Maori lakes tenderloin, blue cheese pressed potato, spinach and red wine jus. I asked for medium and it was done just right, not too bloody with a bit of pink in the center. The meat was just so tender and juicy (still cannot compare to American beef in flavor) that it was with sadness when I popped in the last bite. I wished it was a bigger portion. Just have to come back next time for the 200 gm served in the ala carte menu. The pressed potato (in thin slices) with blue cheese was ok, just a hint of blue cheese so those who do not like it will not be turned off by it. \n\nDessert - tasting platter \nCreme Brulee with salted caramel ice cream - my favorite of the lot. Creamy custard covered with the sugar glaze and topped with salted caramel ice cream. There were also chocolate pearls hidden giving it a nice crunch.\n\nChocolate bar - surprisingly I did not find it that great. There were some wafer bits which tasted a bit soft, not crispy at all. \n\nLicorice ice cream with lime and sago - never a big fan of licorice though the lime did give it a bit of contrasting flavor and made it more palatable to me.\n\nCoffee was normal. You could select the tea of your choice, you just have to ask them what is available. \n\nSo yes, I would want to go back again, just to have the tenderloin and for the view. It is a very nice view and will probably be fantastic to dine in the evening to see the sunset.\n\nNOTE: To get there, you need to turn right and right and left (when you see the TV) to get to the elevator to Salt Grill. It can get a tad confusing and dark to find.","review_date":"21/3/2013","category":"Food & Beverage"}

But we decided to finally try it out on a random Sunday lunch, and ultimately and surprisingly had one of the most satisfying dining experience in Sing. \n\n1. The service was perfect. From the moment we walked in, we were pleasantly greeted and escorted to one of the many seats next to the windows for the perfect view and we were able to see our condo from our seat! the kind and attentive waiter really knew his menu and was always readily available. \n3.

It was prepared in such a way that I've never tried before, drenched in garlic and other sauces, and it was just perfection with the garlic toast pairing.\n\nMain course:\n-Seared Blue Fin tuna, potato, pimento, softquail egg, olives & anchovies dressing:  never thought i'd write a comment on an egg, but i've never tried an egg that was cooked So perfectly that it's bouncy yet so soft.  tuna and all the ingredients came together so well.\n-Goats cheese gnocchi, beets, vincotto, burnt butter dressing, pistachio, raisons: again, the ingredients in the dish came together so well, that we were forking everything together in one-bite to experience the bursting of flavors. it was perfect. \n\ndessert:\nwe got the sorbet, crumbs and berries and dessert of the day which was a winner. \n\nWe exited the restaurant as if we paid over $200 for the service, location, and the amazing food, when it was around $110 altogether.

Walk around the desk and you'll see the welcome area for Salt. Someone will guide you to the special elevator bank that will whisk you up to the 55th floor.\n\nWalking into the main dining room, your breath will be taken away by the lovely views of Singapore.

I can't comment on the oysters as I'm allergic, but I will say the Sydney crab omelette was a-ok. I know people rave about it, but it's simply not my type of dish.\n\nHowever, I really loved our main. We did the meat cut for two, which changes daily. That day, it was a bone-in ribeye. It came with onion rings, a rocket salad, and mash. Miguel doesn't like potatoes much, so we asked if we could replace the mash with the roast garlic mushrooms and luckily they obliged.\n\nThe rocket salad was my type of salad: blue cheese, pear, and candied walnuts. All so good! The steak was juicy and I loved the horseradish/pepper jus that it was drenched in. Throw in a decent bottle of wine (we decided on a cab sauv from California) and we were in heaven. \n\nFor a moment, I was worried because the table next to us brought a baby with them... but thankfully the baby was quiet and didn't disturb our dinner. Overall, the ambiance was set nicely with the dim lighting and bossa nova soundtrack in the background. The service was impeccable and we didn't feel rushed at all throughout the evening.

Swanky it is, Salt grill &amp; Sky Bar serves up some Modern Australian cuisine by celebrity chef-restaurateur Luke Mangan and is known for its one-of-a-kind experience that begins even before guests enter the restaurant. Special concierge reception, private lift, exclusive dining area... it's hard not to feel special here.\n\nModern Australian cuisine is an intersection of influences from cuisines around the world and i could taste that rightaway in the Amuse Bouche, Coconut broth with Sydney spice. Flavor-wise, it tasted very much like Thai Green Curry without the spice.\n\nWe then proceeded with our wine and dine event and our dishes were paired with drinks from the Award Winning New World Wine List of the Year 2013 by the World Gourmet Summit. There is also the signature range of eponymous 'Luke Mangan' wines which are produced in one of Australia's leading wine estates - TarraWarra Estate in Yarra Valley, which Chef Mangan was personally involved in the selection of the grapes and the blending of the wines.\n\nSpring vegetables were served with the mild goats curd, ginger bread crumbs and dried black olives ($31). These are probably sous vide to seal in the freshness of spring.\n\nI love my eggs and the 'Glass' Sydney crab omelette ($33) totally won me over with the precious sheets of runny egg in the center, enoki mushroom and herb salad in miso mustard broth. A generous serving of sweet crab meat was wrapped in the golden parcel. This is certainly a light dish that is refreshing with a basil taste (again, this is almost Thai food). \n\nSignature starters include the Tea smoked quail ($31), an original creation in which the bird is smoked with a combination of earl grey tea and rice, and nicely paired with almond cream, prunes, truffled grains (i believe there is quinoa), grilled shallot, sorrel. There are so many dimensions and flavors to this dish and i was slowly savoring each component. I haven't had prunes in a dish for sometime and it went well with the smokey tender quail.\n\nFor mains, we had the Sirloin Rangers Valley, New South Wales, 300 days grain fed Wagyu ($74). Moroccan spice, sautÃ© spinach, eggplant puree, red wine sauce  Wasabi, whole grain mustard. Fantastic aubergine spiced purÃ©e. Pick your cut from the meat board before having it grilled to your preference (only medium rare for me).\n\nDessert was pleasantly surprising with Luke's liquorice parfait ($18). I don't quite like licorice but i was amazed at how interesting the flavor and texture worked together especially with lime. You gotta try it for yourself.","review_date":"11/5/2014","category":"Food & Beverage"}

The perfectly cooked scallop seemed a bit extraneous.\n\nIt basically went straight downhill from there. Our mains (snapper and kingfish) were fine but both over cooked. Dessert was ok, Coffees were outrageously overpriced. Service started off acceptable and dropped exponentially over the evening.","review_date":"24/9/2015","category":"Food & Beverage"}

However, you walk through a shopping mall going in and again coming out which somehow lessens the experience (in my opinion) and leads me to wonder why the architects would not have considered having the lift run all the way to the ground floor instead. This is for sure not the fault of the restaurant. \n\nNonetheless, the food, while being good, is somewhat overpriced. For 70+ sgd  for a steak there is an expectation that is not quite matched. Especially as the entrees are not served with much else, and each side dish at 10+ sgd, the costs run high quickly. Having said that the presentation is great as is the wine selection, the amuses bouches and the drinks.\n\nI would absolutely recommend this place to have a drink, some appetizers and enjoy the view, but for a great steak, I would go elsewhere for value-money.","review_date":"3/10/2015","category":"Food & Beverage"}

Summer Pavilion is tucked away in the back left of the hotel lobby and was unmarked from the lobby, a touch odd. The Ritz is definitely \"classic\" luxury. \n\nClientele seemed touristy, including some loud tourists from mainland China speaking in their outdoor voices inside the restaurant... Staff wore a uniform, name tag, and a mask. Some staff even wore vinyl gloves.\n\nDespite being a Michelin 1 star for Cantonese cuisine, the experience was more of a Westernized appraoch to Cantonese cuisine...\n\nOrdered mainly from the Chef's Recommendation menu and started off with the scallop and eggplant. The Hokaido scallop was poached and seared perfectly. The shrimp paste inside the eggplant was on the blander side and now I understand why I was offered chili to complement this... \n\nMoved on to the seared Japanese wagyu beef with wild mushrooms and it was a slightly bizarre experience. Both the scallop and beef course were served with a side of knife and fork...I wasn't sure what was so Cantonese about this dish...might have been more Japanese/Western fusion?!?\n\nThe highlight of the meal was the fish noodle with Canadian lobster. The fish noodles were world class with a perfect al dente texture from what seemed to be fish paste. The Canadian lobster was decent, although I'm sure I've had fresher lobster in Canada...\n\nEnded off the meal with the mango sago and it was a disappointment. The highlight were the fresh and flavorful mangos, same as I was able to find at the local grocery store. The actual sago was on the bland side...bummer.\n\nService throughout the meal was attentive, although not quite up to par with Michelin-rated standards.

I have never experienced such blatant racism anywhere.\n\nWe paid $35 per person just to enter this so-called \"club lounge,\" and that credit could be used toward food--but what's the point if they refuse to serve you? We waited a good 30 minutes, and not a single server came to us. I had to start flagging them down, and even then, two servers brushed me off, saying they'd come back but never did. When I finally got a third server's attention, I was told they don't serve food in the area we were sitting in. That was a lie.\n\nLess than a foot away, a white couple was getting full service, with a server coming up to them to ask if they wanted to order more food. At the same time, another server was bringing food to the white couple sitting behind us. It was so bad that the white couple next to us even offered to order food for us because they saw what was happening.\n\nAnd here's the kicker: the servers who ignored us were Asian themselves. They deliberately chose to serve white and Japanese guests while refusing to serve us. This wasn't bad service--this was outright discrimination.\n\nIf you're not white or Japanese, don't waste your time or money here.

The voucher only lets you in to the lounge and restaurant areas, so you can't actually go to the skypark but you still get the incredible view. The view is amazing. You can see so much of Singapore from the 57th floor. I just wish that the experience at the lounge could have been better. They let way too many people up considering that they had half of the seating blocked off and covered. The result? Nearly everyone was stuck standing and it was extremely crowded. It was very difficult to walk. \n\nThe food was mediocre. Definitely not worth the money. The chicken satay reminded me more of kabob that anything else, and the korean chicken wings honestly did not taste good at all. They had a strange flavor and they were very spicy.

The MBS is a little set aside from the the rest of the CBD, which means that it's an excellent spot to scope out both the older Raffles Place CBD and the Marina Bay Financial Centre.  It's a different perspective compared to some other rooftop bars which are nestled in the CBD, and thus don't offer that panoramic view.\n\nBesides the views, the other factors here are adequate-to-good.  Decent cocktail and drinks list.  Bar snacks are limited.  Crowded.  Unless there's a special event on, music is not spectacular.

{"company_name":"JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach","stars":"1","text":"EDIT: My previous review remains below, however I will say that this Marriott property \"loyalty and guest services manager\" reached out and apologized that we were unsatisfied with the room, and that she would attempt to find another equivalent room at a higher floor. In the morning we were made aware that our new room was made available, I was a little bit confused as I hadn't made a request to move rooms, nor made aware of any of the details of the move. We were just told to pack, they'd move the luggage, and give us the new keys. Upon arrival, we both immediately noticed that the room was significantly smaller. Like 15-20% smaller, and that's being conservative. At this point I'm a little bit frustrated that we moved from a room with a bad view, to a tiny room with a different view, just 3 floors higher. We then received an email that our room was DOWNGRADED to a deluxe room in order to get a higher floor, with only a $47 compensation for the remainder of the days. What the heck?! That barely covers a single burger off the room service menu here. Following that, we complained and requested an equivalent room rather than a downgrade. This is where the great tour of the JW Marriott occurred. We were then moved to floor 8, where upon entering the third room we were offered, I noticed a very murky almost 'wet-dog' smell. Upon further inspection, I found a lot of stains in the carpet that I assume was either blood or feces. Off the side of the bathtub, there was actual fecal matter--showing the quality of housekeeping in this property. At this point I was exceptionally irritated by the search to find an acceptable room. Fourth time, the manager we were working with personally inspected the room, it was the cleanest of the rooms, but still had what I can only assume is bed bugs ingrained in the carpet. And the AC does not function at all in the last room. We gave up trying after running around, packing and unpacking our belongings over the span of 4 hours --which would've better been spent exploring Singapore instead of wasting our time finding an acceptable room. The only offer we received for the inconvenience was 10,000 Marriott points ($100 US value), up from 7000 points offered after making the staff aware of the state of the third room.\n\nOne thing that really irked me is the fact that the loyalty and guest services manager downgraded our room from premier to deluxe, despite having 2 more 'equivalent' premier rooms available immediately, and without my knowledge nor consent. A real 'punch to the face' if you will.\n\n\n--Old Review--\nVery new property. The whole hotel gives me a bit of a grand and fancy property vibe with the esplanade train connection and number of good restaurants on the basement floor. This hotel has a 5-star location, with 5-star equivalent surrounding amenities, and a 5-star hotel exterior design.\n\nThe lobby is however very narrow making it prone to traffic jams, the service at the front desk is quite slow. I think the front desk might've not appreciated my late arrival due to an almost 2.5 hour flight delay - because I was placed in a room below the roof line, where pool-goers have a direct line of sight into my room. This is also with a status that supposedly guarantees a room upgrade when available, but for whatever reason we got no upgrade. Every single person I've ridden the elevator up with has been placed on a high floor, except me. Strange. The service staff lacks the warmth and welcome that others are trained to never slack on--After staying at multiple high end hotels (Conrad, Shangrila, Aman, Ritz, etc) I can positively say that JW lacks everything in the hospitality and service that higher end hotels offer. Just as an example--when arriving at the Ritz just down the street we were given a warm welcome and a tour of the facilities, and the were made aware of all of the hotels exits. The only 'welcome' we got was from a staff member who said 'Merry Christmas, by the way the wifi is out - so if you want food, write it down on a sheet of paper'. Yikes. The minibar and room service is horrendously overpriced--even compared to the ritz, the included amenities are very cheap. I noticed there's even paint peeling inside of my room. On the second day I noticed room service hadn't set the bed properly, so the fitted sheet was just laying on top of the bed. The shower drain is absolutely caked in mold/mildew so I have no doubt that they never clean the area properly as well. There's just so many details that make me believe this isn't worthy of a 5 star rating.","review_date":"28/12/2022","category":"Hotels"}

I had been flying for the past 24 hours and took 3 separate planes to get here, normally I would take care of myself but it was all I could do was drag myself behind him to check in.\n\nThe team at the front desk was cordial, helpful and fast with getting me what I needed to get upstairs as quickly as possible. I travel frequently for work so I have status with Marriott. It allowed me to request an upgrade from my standard room with two twin beds into a corner suite that essentially is about as large as my 2B2B condominium in Chicago. The views are pretty sweet- I'm looking at the famous Raffles hotel and there's even 1.5 bathrooms for me. I'm sure if I had more than one person staying in here we would have use for the main living area as well as the extra half bathroom but I'm not someone who would need any of this.\n\nThe bathroom has a full tub and shower with multiple spray options for those who like to take their time getting ready in the morning.\n\nWith my status comes access to the Executive Lounge- where there is a daily buffet from 6-10:30 for breakfast, which has just about everything you can think of- very eclectic so there's something for everyone. Local flavors, classic N American style meats, fruits and charcuterie and smoked salmon. Bread, cereal, omelette/egg stations round out your choices. Tough not to overeat and breakfast isn't generally something I usually indulge in. \n\nThey offer afternoon tea service daily from 2:30-5, and hors d'oeuvres from 5:30-7:30 (along with cocktails from 5:30-9:30. The small items they advertise are basically good enough to substitute for dinner. Today they had the bread, salad, fruit station, warm bao with BBQ meat, charcuterie and small bites like burrata with diced tomatoes and basil strips served in shot glasses, and fried shrimp, veggie rolls, and other stuff that anyone can find something to satisfy their desires. \n\nAlso there's  a dessert table with various local delicacies, tarts, and you could hit up the fruit station if you're still hungry. I had a chance to speak \nwith Chef Arjun about how great my experience with the lounge food has been, from trying local dishes to various items from the mix of cultures that visit or have immigrated to Singapore. I especially noted to Arjun how much I appreciated the authenticity of the dishes- I tried curried potatoes as a side for breakfast and it was nothing I was accustomed to. He asked if I would be back tomorrow for the cocktail hour because he wanted to prepare something special for me. I'm unfortunately going to be on a bus tour tomorrow night but I'm looking forward to Monday's event just because nobody has ever offered something like this before and it was definitely flattering.\n\nIf you need to get local currency, the front desk can accommodate you. I'm sure the concierge can hook you up with whatever you're looking to do here. The hotel is pretty much going to come through wherever, and whenever you need something. \n\nWe are above an MRT station, there's plenty of restaurants and beverage options nearby and you can get anywhere you need to easily. On the recommendation of the front desk associate upon checking in, I downloaded the App: Grab, which is like Uber, Grubhub, Expedia and Ticketmaster all mashed up in one. You can get a car or taxi ride for cheaper than flagging one down. \n\nI've got just about three nights left, and I am going to enjoy the rest of my stay before flying home to Chicago. \n\nIf you have a chance to pick where you're planning on staying I suggest you consider this property. Newer building, impeccable service, and great location. I'm coming back for certain. And I'll stay longer than five nights so I can adjust to the time change much easier than this past trip. \n\nBefore I leave I'm going to eat at Akira Back's place and treat myself to a fantastic last meal for this visit. \n\nPS- if you like coffee there's a Starbucks within 50 yards of the front entrance.","review_date":"14/12/2019","category":"Hotels"}

This allowed access to a full breakfast (fresh coffee that is grounded for my pleasure), appetizers, free alcohol, and tons of eats. One of my favorites was getting something from the chef and smoked salmon. Since Singapore is on the expensive side for booze it was a pleasant surprise to enjoy free drinks ranging from Tiger beer on draft, wines, spirits, and if you are lucky the staff will make your drinks to include the famous Singapore Sling.","review_date":"14/7/2017","category":"Hotels"}

It's also quite close to the CBD. The JW is a modern hotel with all the amenities for a great stay. \n\nI took the hotel car service from Changi airport and it was punctual even with a longer than expected wait at immigration. Upon arrival I was greeted by Amanda who whisked me and my bags to my room to avoid a line at the front desk where she handled the check-in in private, which after a long flight from Tokyo was much appreciated. \n\nMy room was bright and modern was designed for function. While not as large as many hotel rooms in which I've stayed in Singapore it never felt small. Housekeeping did an impeccable job throughout my entire stay and on the weekend turned my room when I was in the lounge for breakfast. \n\nThe Executive Lounge at the JW was exceptional. With a wide array of eastern and western choices one was easily able to find something to eat. The breakfast service also included made to order omelettes and chicken or pork soup. The lounge had 3 food presentations daily, so very easy to grab a bite. \n\nI also visited Akira, the Japanese Restaurant which was also quite good, although at a slightly higher price point than the average restaurant.

After arriving early in Singapore from a nonstop flight out of San Francisco, the hotel accommodated my early check in with no issue - albeit I was on a low floor and did not get a king as requested. \n\nAll the staff encountered here were friendly and willing to help. For a JW Marriott, the decor is much more trendy and modern than you'd expect. The room was small but that was a non issue - the bathroom is beautifully designed with a soaking tub, separate shower room with rain shower from the ceiling and a \"Tokyo-esque\" toilet. My only complaints were no outlets in the bathroom, and the mirrors in the room are darkly tinted which looks cool, but makes it a little hard to see yourself when getting ready. I ordered room service once during my stay, the menu was pretty limited, but the club sandwich was good.\n\nThe club lounge here is the absolute best I've experienced compared to any other Marriott with a great selection of food options, both eastern and western. There are breakfast, afternoon tea, hors d'oeuvres, and evening cocktail hours. It also has business meeting space and a computer with printer if needed. \n\nThe spa does not post their prices online, but I emailed an appointment request and got a quick reply with a price sheet. Hotel guests also get $30 off spa treatments. I had a great treatment and enjoyed the steam room and sauna pre facial and the zero gravity relaxing chair area post facial. It was a bit pricey and they pushed their product packages at the end but it was an excellent facility - highly recommend.","review_date":"6/2/2018","category":"Hotels"}
{"company_name":"JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach","stars":"5","text":"I stayed here for three nights during my second visit to Singapore and had a lovely stay. \n\nWe had arrived on an early United flight and got to the hotel around 10 AM. Our room was not available just yet so they let us leave our bags and visit the executive lounge for breakfast. The lounge is the best executive lounge I have ever seen at a Marriott. It blows the lounge at the JW in Mexico City and Kuala Lumpur out of the water. They had pastries, all sorts of cured meats and cheese, all sorts of fruit and fruit juices, a cereal bar, a dim sum section, and a made to order omelette station. \n\nAfter breakfast our room was ready and we were quite impressed by the size. We easily fit a roll away bed inside. The decor was very modern but I found that all the tracked rolling mirrors were frustrating at times. For instance, the bathroom mirror slides away into the bedroom which seems kind of pointless. This feature just allowed lots of noise to leak from the bathroom into the bedroom. Otherwise everything else was top notch: smart toilet, rainfall shower, automated blinds and curtains. \n\nAside from the room I also spent a good amount of time at flow 18. They have a ping pong table, bar, pool table, and infinity pool up there. The view from the infinity pool is really pretty at night but unfortunately the pool water is quite cold since it is often in the shade and not heated. It is a little uncomfortable to lounge in which is quite a pity...\n\nI want to note that the concierge was extremely helpful. I had bought city pass tickets for the wrong date (one week in advance doh!) and they were on the phone for over a half an hour deciphering what needed to be done. \n\nIf you have Marriott gold status this hotel is an excellent choice and a strong upgrade from the Marriott on Orchard road.","review_date":"23/2/2018","category":"Hotels"}
{"company_name":"JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach","stars":"5","text":"Hands down the best hotel I have stayed at period! I have stayed at thousands of hotels throughout the world and this is by far my favorite. From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave you are treated as you're an elite status person. \n\nUpon arriving and entering into the property there is a giant screen w/ a constant movie image straight out of tie dye from the 70s. Then entering into the registration area you see the class that the hotel has to offer. The staff was very friendly and it wasn't just the person I spoke w/ upon check-in, but EVERYONE on property. The check-in process was easy and quick. As we made our way to our room we entered the elevator and we noticed that the elevator changes light colors. \n\nUpon entering our room, my gf immediately got mad. Not because of the way the room looked, but because of how it looked. She had paid for us to stay one night at the Marina Bay Sands at $500 (see my review). We got more bang for our buck staying at this property than over at MBS. Within the room we were given 2 bottles of water complimentary. The bellman that helped us w/ our bags, showed us all the features to the room which was maintained from the television. From the curtains to the temperature to the tv itself. The rooms are newer so it has the USB plugs as well as the traditional ports.\n\nThe pool is located on the 14th floor if I recall. It's a small infinity pool w/ chairs in the water. It offers a view of downtown to which you can see the Marina Bay Sands, amongst other sites.\n\nThe main stand out for me was their Executive Lounge. Hands down the best lounge I have ever been too. This includes airport AND hotel lounges. In the lounge they offer not only your typical items, but pieces of sushi, a variety of fruits, veggies, snacks, candies and numerous other items. Not to mention a bar that has beer on draft! On top of that we were unable to have breakfast the next morning due to our early flight. The staff was kind enough to prepare a to-go breakfast for us.\n\nThe hotel is close to all the tourist sites. Singapore also has Uber which was easy to use from our hotel. \n\nIf you're planning to stay anywhere in Singapore, I urge you to stay here. You won't be disappointed in any aspect.

{"company_name":"JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach","stars":"5","text":"This is my new fav hotel in Singapore. 2nd stay and 1st time reviewing it. Fairly new hotel, about 7m old as of this writing. It took over another hotel that didn't do well. \n\nLet's start from the hotel's road entrance. The entrance is located along nicoll highway although the address is 30  Beach Rd. This is probably one of the most confusing thing about the place. Uber, Grab, taxi don't know where to go if you say JW Marriott South Beach. This location is simply South Beach and the sign at the entrance on nicoll highway reflects that. The JW Marriott sign is on the hotel and half way up the building. The structure is remarkable and easy to identify so most times, I would point to it and tell the driver to drive in that direction. \n\nThe main door of the hotel is in a cul de sac with a bowl of overflowing water. Around the bowl are quotes about water, including \"be like water .....\" - Bruce Lee. How cool is that?\n\nInside the entry is a huge digital display that has artsy design constantly swirling around. I saw a lot of people taking photos in front of it. I would suggest a video instead. \n\nTurn right and immediately left to see the front desks. It is long and during the day, it is filled with staff. Everyone I have met is so friendly. They greet you with a smile as you walk by them. Very good service. Always helpful. \n\nThe decor is very comtemporary and nice. I did not like how the walls are painted. initially I thought they weren't, that it is dirty and waiting for a final coat of paint. I got use to it by the end of my stay. The lighting in the elevators changes and with each change, the pictures on the sides changes. \n\nThe rooms - I had a room on the 21st and 15th floors. The first room faced raffles hotel, the second faced suntec. Views at these levels can't go wong but I do keep the shades closed as it can get warm with the sun shining in. \n\nHigh tech! That's how I would described the rooms. The curtains and shades are controlled by switches on the wall next to them or if you are a geek, use the tv with the remote. I bet you can spend 15 mins just playing with the curtains and shades. \n\nThe SmartTV is also cool. I like the relaxing playlist. If you leave the tv on when you leave the room, it will start back up when you enter the room. Can be annoying as the volume auto goes back up. Also if it was on a playlist, it will likely have reached the end of that playlist and loops on that last song. You will need to go back to the category and then back to playlist to select the first song if you like to start from the beginning. \n\nThe bed and pillows are very comfort. Everything in the room is shiny. Lots of reflective surfaces around the room makes it look huge. I love the couch by the window for reading.  Ample space to hang up your clothes. Not enough drawer space for me. There were 2 and smaller than usual. In between the two drawers is a drawer safe. Initially I had a hard time figuring where to put my suitcase and eventually found a smaller closet near the door. The wall paper covering made this closet \"disappear \" - think Sherlock Holmes. Anyway, hotel staff has access to this area as this where you would put your shoes and dirty clothes for laundry services. How neat is that?\n\nBathroom - you need to find it. the door leading into the bathroom is a huge mirror as well. The bathroom is gorgeous with the soaking tub. A separate toilet and shower means no need to fight over the use of the place, if you don't mind some soaking outside while you take a dump or vice versa. The toilet bowl is ... high tech too. The cover automatically opens when you approach it. The seat is heated. After you are done, the bidet can be customized for up to two users. Anyway, just try it. Shower room has spray as well as a rain shower head from the ceiling. There are two controls. The top control diverts water to the spray or the ceiling or Off. The bottom control controls the temperature. There is a small button on the control. To get hotter water,  press that button down before turning. It will allow you to increase temperature past the \"comfort\" zone.  The one complain about the bathroom is that there are no hangers! I had to drape the wet towel used after my showers over the soaking tub. There is a stool in the bathroom where housekeeping put the fresh towel each day. Other than that no hooks. \n\nSince I'm a club member, I had access to the lounge. No need to repeat what others have said. Service and space are amazing! I recommend the rendang omelet and the local selections are quiet good too. During my stay of 7 days, I have had most of my meals here. I did not see any waffle station mentioned in other reviews. Their smoke salmon selections and pastries are good. A friend had the big croissant and thought it was not fluffy enough. \n\nNo more space to talk about JW spa that just opened. Another tip - there are 2 pools. Ebb6 is warmer than the one in 18th floor.","review_date":"9/5/2017","category":"Hotels"}

Firstly, the hotel is brand new, with the latest technology and chic rooms. Though the rooms were not large by US standards, it was very well-thought out. Our corner room 2016 had a fantastic view of the CBD (Central Business District) and a lovely view of the Marina Bay. We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands the last time we visited.

{"company_name":"JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach","stars":"5","text":"The service from the team here at the JW Singapore was outstanding from start to finish.\n\nAs a Platinum Premier, Marriott has been very good to take care of me on most of my hotel stays.  This specific hotel went above and beyond with regards to making sure I had a good stay.  For starters, they reached out over a week in advance to see if there was anything they could assist with prior to arrival.  They were also kind enough to upgrade the room to a beautiful suite far in advance.  Certainly unexpected, but more than appreciated.\n\nOur arrival was late night due to the Singapore Airlines flight from Sydney's arrival.  We checked in around midnight.  Being that time, the hotel was of course quiet.  It was the perfect time to take in this wonderfully designed, modern hotel.  Check in was swift and efficient, with just the right amount of information.  Given our late night flight the next day, they also offered a late checkout, which we enjoyed because we wanted to see the light show at the Gardens By The Bay where the \"super trees\" are.\n\nRoom was amazing, VERY high tech, incredible comfortable and well designed.  Walk in closets, coffee bar, two bathrooms, double sinks in master, all electronic curtains and blinds, temperature controls and most hotel services are all on the television as well.  Note: Not for the technically challenged (my parents would not even get the lights on).\n\nLounge access the next morning for breakfast...also amazing.  Staff available to assist at ever corner, great food selections including a omelet chef, it has something for everyone.  We also took advantage of the afternoon cocktail hour and grabbed some food because our flight departed at midnight.\n\nRooftop pools, there are two.  We enjoyed the view from the 18th floor and relaxed without many guests.  There was also a gymnasium on this level.\n\nNo lack of service anywhere at this hotel.

Been coming to Singapore for 30 years, and have a certain level of expectation for a high-end hotel in this city.  JW Marriott just did not make it, and I'm a Platinum member, so I was really surprised and disappointed.  Checked in online, so the hotel would know I was coming.  Lots of warmth at the reception area, which was nice.  Open the door to my room: two single beds.  I'm only 6' tall, and my feet hung over the end of the bed.  Too tired after the flight from Europe to argue, just went to sleep.  Next morning, I requested a change: king bed, higher floor, a view.  Got all three, in a room that was actually physically smaller than the first night.  \n\nAs for the Executive Lounge, it seemed like it was open to anyone who was smart enough to go to the second floor, and walk across a breezeway.  Place was absolutely packed.  Perhaps there really were that many qualified guests, but who knows? No one ever asked for a room number or anything.\n\nI will give props to two places in the general South Beach center: the Beach House Kitchen has a great breakfast buffet, and the Starbucks on the ground floor is very nice.\n\nBut the hotel?

Don't get me wrong...breakfast was great with different \"stations\" built around various types of food. The only disappointment there was the waffle/pancake station. It wasn't maned so the only choice were cold waffles that were cooked long before I arrived there. It was probably because I had breakfast pretty early each morning to beat the crowds.

The admission fee was S$32 per adult, which was included in our excursion.\n\nWe've been to the Gardens By The Bay's Supertree Grove nighttime light show and wandered through both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest during a previous visit, but this time, we got a different perspective of the gardens during the daytime.  We entered the Flower Dome, exploring unique plants native to the Mediterranean region, South African savannahs, and dry, arid deserts.  There were colorful blooming flowers everywhere, and since we were visiting in April, the central exhibit featured Spring-blooming tulips associated with Netherlands-like decor.  The wholly indoor and climate-controlled dome is comfortable to stroll through while admiring the flowers and plants and, fortunately, also provides many as a respite from the sun-scorching outdoor heat. \n\nAs much as I enjoyed the beautiful flowers in the Flower Dome, I preferred wandering through the Cloud Forest, where the world's tallest indoor waterfall flows, and seeing the exotic, tropical, and lush plants found in tropical mountain regions from around the globe from elevated pathways.  We avoided some crowds waiting at the elevators to ascend the waterfall pathway by taking the staircases as we regained our energy by cooling down in the Flower Dome.  While walking down the elevated path, we were well above treetops and could view our next destination in the garden, the Skytree Observatory.\n\nI can't decide which view I prefer between nighttime and day since the gardens look different based on the light source.

{"company_name":"Gardens By The Bay","stars":"5","text":"We spent 36 hours in Singapore last month, landing early in the morning after a short red-eye. Tired and unshowered, with hours to go until we could get into our hotel room, we took the subway to Gardens by the Bay. This was the right call, as it turned out: a morning visit when the heat was reasonable, a few hours before the promised afternoon rain. As first-time tourists, we were also happy to check Singapore's number one attraction off our list.\n\nThe place was spectacular, a 260-acre park dense with both plant life and architectural splendor. We'd been to the United Arab Emirates the week before and seen the Dubai Miracle Garden, an expression of floral opulence from the people who brought us the Burj Khalifa. Gardens by the Bay had the same over-the-top ethos, but it made the Dubai garden look like a small, charming amusement park.\n\nTickets were quite expensive, with most of the individual attractions priced a la carte. We bought combo tickets for the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, at $59 (SGD)--about $44 (USD)--apiece. We added the Supertree Observatory and the OCBC Skyway, which each cost another $14 (SGD) per ticket. Resident prices were considerably lower, which makes sense. If I lived in Singapore, my kids would grow up playing in the Gardens.\n\nIf you've seen Crazy Rich Asians (or, I don't know, googled Singapore, you've probably come across pictures of Gardens by the Bay and its distinctive Supertrees, striking tree-like structures that serve as vertical gardens teeming with orchids and myriad other plants. We started our visit at the Supertree Observatory in the tallest of the eighteen Supertrees, going up to a rooftop deck with breathtaking views of Singapore. We didn't make it to the Marina Bay Sands on this trip, but we did get some good pictures with it from the Supertree (it is, it must be said, a very cool but very ugly building).\n\nWe hit the OCBC Skyway next, getting the outdoor stuff out of the way while it was comparatively cool (sweltering hot by most standards) and not raining. This was an aerial walkway suspended between two Supertrees, with more lovely views.\n\nThe giant shell-like glasshouses of the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome form the other salient architectural feature of Gardens by the Bay. We spent most of our visit walking through this conservatory complex, which was genuinely astonishing.\n\nThe Cloud Forest offered a multi-story walk in the clouds, with a meticulously controlled tropical mountain climate, achieved with the help of periodic misting that gave it a Jurassic Park vibe (there was a light Jurassic Park--or at least Jurassic--motif running throughout the Gardens). We started at the top and wound down through the varying elevations, passing the giant indoor waterfall several times--apparently the second-tallest indoor waterfall in the world, after the Rain Vortex at the Changi Airport, which we saw the next day. The whole place was ragingly lush, with everything from carnivorous plants to countless varieties of orchids. Tons of stuff for the 'gram, what with the waterfall and the plant walls, plus Chihuly glass and a room full of stalagmites and stalactites.\n\nThe Flower Dome is the world's largest glass greenhouse, and it was sumptuous and impressive, with a sunny garden party atmosphere. We're from California and enjoyed the California garden, as well as the other regional gardens on display. I especially liked the many baobabs. The plants were interspersed with animal sculptures that were somehow not that cheesy. There was an Alice in Wonderland display, as well as a prominent Yayoi Kusama sculpture of a girl in colorful polka dots. The Flower Dome also has a space for a rotation of seasonal displays. We were there at the end of the Carnival of Flowers, an Australian carnival-themed floral show featuring kangaroos, a ferris wheel, and a merry-go-round (none real, but nice to look at). The Flower Dome ticket included entry into the Monet experience, which is what it sounds like, one of those pretty but soulless art attractions made for social media.\n\nWe browsed the gift shop and picked up a few souvenirs, including a post card and magnets and glow-in-the-dark T-shirts for our kids (surprisingly a much smaller selection of these for children than for adults). I loved the two women who helped us out, the no-nonsense older lady who knew exactly what sizes to get for our boys off the top of her head, and the younger cashier who checked us out with the lithe efficiency of a Vegas dealer.\n\nWe spent a good two hours at Gardens by the Bay, moving at a fairly brisk clip. It was a marvelous, one-of-a-kind place, a must-visit for anyone passing through Singapore. I kept thinking about how much my sons would enjoy it, and I hope to take them one day.

We got tickets through viator which is a third party but it includes the full tour of the gardens. Flower dome is a beautiful walk through where you can see all the flowers from different countries even different theme arrangements. Luckily we went near Christmas and New Years so they had the cutest elf spring theme and reindeer sleigh theme. It was so huge you literally can get lost. From desert flowers to holland tulips and Italian greenery. They have so much things you can learn.\n\nCloud forest- The other part of the tour was like walking into the avatar movie. the waterfalls and sounds were so amazing. You can literally walk up to the 6th floor and reach the very top of the Forest dome. There are also elevators to make it easier for those tho can not walk too much or those with strollers. Each floor had something so cool to see. you can literally touch the leaf pad and it takes your hand warmth to generate light all throughout the forest. Also there is a floor where you can see an actual avatar flying dino with its eggs. A simulator where you can turn into an avatar and just so much to mention.

The food culture is simply overwhelming here with restaurants everywhere: hotels, hawker centers, malls, MRT stations, and yes standalone restaurants.  Some big food courts even have smaller food courts inside.  Don't get me started on the malls either - imagine the Las Vegas strip with casinos replaced by malls. That's like Orchard Road.\n\nTo take a break from all this and get back to nature, I highly recommend Gardens By the Bay.  They have multiple ticket options and you can easily spend 1 hour to an entire day here.  The Gardens, and the neighboring Marina Bay Sands lights up at night.\n\nHighlights of my visit:\n* The lowest price ticket is Floral Fantasy.  You get entrance through an indoor conservatory with some very artistic floral arrangements, complete with waterfalls, statues, and sounds.  Lots of places for selfies and Instagram-worthy pictures.  At the end, there's a cool 4D virtual ride which provides a nice overview of the other exhibits.\n* The Poison Dart Frog exhibit was cool, showing multiple species of this tiny, but dangerous animal. The Gold one secretes enough poison to kill 10 people or 20,000 mice.\n* After that, its free to walk around the massive gardens yourself to check out those SuperTrees and some truly amazing outdoor art sculptures.\n* For food and drinks, try the Jurassic Food Court serving up 1-Michelin dishes like ramen, soya chicken, etc. at the various food stands.  \n* You can get some nice shots of the Bay, Marina Bay Sands, and Singapore Flyer too.\n* Signage is good so you won't get lost wandering.

I only went for 2-3 hours and that wasn't enough.  Next time I visit I look to stay longer.  The gardens are huge with many different types of gardens and tons of food options.  For food I just opted for shake shack, but they have a food court, hawker center and other popular dinning options on the site.  \n\nIf you could only do one ticketed event I would have to say it would need to be the cloud forest.  A rain forest dome with a mountain you can scale on the center with a multi story water fall.  We probably spent most of our time here and it speaks to just how grand things are in Singapore.  I did see the flower dome which was really good, but not as impressive as the cloud forest.  Back in the States we have the Bellagio gardens in Vegas which is what this reminded me of.  \n\nOne word of advice is the gardens grounds are huge  and it can be easy to get lost especially at night which happened to me.

As in, if you only have a short amount of time and can only make it to ONE place, this would be it. The main attractions are the very famous super grove trees, cloud forest, flower dome, floral fantasy, and OCBC skyway (walkway).  Aside from this there are also many smaller attractions like garden areas, pathways, and more.  \n\nYou could easily spend a whole day here if you really wanted to explore.  You could also do it in a couple hours too. I'd personally recommend about 3 hours to hit the main parts.\n\nAdmission to the park itself is free, however you will have to buy tickets for the bigger attractions like some of the ones mentioned above. The super trees are free though! I think that's pretty cool since they are probably the most well-known image you'd think of. You can buy these other tickets ahead online, and that's very convenient. They have several options depending on what all you want to do. I'd say my favorite ticket item was the cloud forest (which is typically sold in combination with the flower dome) and the OCBC skyway.  I just loved being among those super trees I had seen in photos so many times.\n\nI almost forgot! They also have a light show at the trees 2x every night.

{"company_name":"Gardens By The Bay","stars":"5","text":"Gardens by the Bay is a must-see when in Singapore! Located behind the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, the area is a short walk from the hotel. You can easily spend half a day or more visiting all the attractions, and my husband and I ended up splitting our visit into two days. One evening to see the Supertrees, walk the OCBC Skyway, and watch the light show, and a second day to visit the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. I used Klook to buy tickets to the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest and saved a decent amount off the door price. \n\nI think the best time to visit the Supertrees and walk the OCBC Skyway is sunset. You'll get those serene pictures of the trees lit up at night (they don't have the same effect during the day) and can catch the nightly 15 minute light show at either 7:45 or 8:45 pm. We did have to buy a separate ticket to go up to the OCBC Skyway and were limited to 15 minutes at the top to keep traffic flowing. The line however, moved pretty fast, and the walkway gave great views of the MBS Hotel and the bay and an aerial view of the trees. The Supertrees are mesmerizing when all lit up, and watching the free Garden Rhapsody light show with my husband was a nice and romantic way to start off our honeymoon. \n\nIt is cherry blossom season in the Flower Dome, and there were a lot of flowers in bloom during my recent visit. The dome features plants and trees from around the world. It took us about 45 minutes to get through the exhibit, and we really liked seeing the Baobab trees and the dragon statue on display. \n\nThe Avitar Experience at the Cloud Forest was a lot of fun. When we first walked in, we saw this massive indoor waterfall and felt like we had been transported to Pandora. Various Avitar characters are scattered throughout the exhibit, and there were opportunities to turn ourselves into an Avitar character and to fly a Banshee! We went up to the top of the waterfall and took the various pathways down. It was great to feel what it's like to be in the cloud forest and to see more great views of the bay. My husband and I spent slightly more than 1 hour in the cloud forest, but the experience could have taken much longer on a busy day. Both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest exit into a gift shop, and I bought myself a set of Supertree stickers to remember the visit. \n\nThere are plenty of food options on-site. We ate at the Jurassic Nest Hall, which allowed us to try several of Singapore's Michelin-rated places, including Hawker Chan's famous Soya Sauce Chicken and Tsuta's Soba Ramen. I was a little disappointed in the Soya Sauce Chicken, but my bowl of Tsuta Ramen was delicious! I ordered the original Truffle Shoyu Soba, and my husband had the crab soba. The soup base was rich in flavor, and the soba noodles were filling but not heavy like traditional ramen noodles. We also tried Took Lae Dee. I highly recommend their Pad See Ew as it was better than any Pad See Ew I've ever had in California. \n\nGardens By the Bay was definitely one of the highlights of my trip, and by going on a weekday, we avoided the crowds!","review_date":"6/4/2023","category":"Arts"}

The domes on the other hand, allow you to get a re-entry stamp when you exit which is valid for the entire day.\n\nBoth the Cloud Forrest and the Flower dome have their charm.  Head to the Flower Dome if you want to immerse yourself in a bouquet of flowers from all over the world.   If you want to feel as if you are in a different planet, go to the Cloud Forrest.  The Cloud Forrest also boasts having one of the largest indoor waterfalls.  It is a spectacular sight to witness with your own eyes.  Explore both domes and learn about sustainability which is prevalent in the structure and urban planning of this beautify country.\n\nI would encourage you to see the park both during the day and at night as the park truly gives off a different energy during both times.   In the evening, there is a light show with the skytreees in the skytree grove that is mesmerizing.   \n\nNote - I would plan accordingly if you do go to the Gardens at night.  Last admission time for the OCBC Skyway is 8pm. Also note that if there is a sign stating that there will be street food, it is concession type food.","review_date":"6/10/2019","category":"Arts"}

There is a champagne room as well where they store their extensive selection.  Menu-wise, the focus here is on gin and champagne, although they have a decent selection of whiskey and other booze as well.  And personally, it's the only place in town with a decent selection of genever - most bars would be lucky to have a single bottle, but here there are probably over 50 different bottles!  The total tally for gin is over 1,000 different bottles from around the globe.  The bartenders are quite good, with a few I recognized from other great Singapore bars such as Anti:dote.  It is a bit more formal here, and even for an open bar seat, you do need to check in with the host.

We couldn't get another order in and - given every cocktail order was meant to be a cheerful negotiation - having cocktail makers who are overloaded makes the whole experience less pleasant.\n\nI suspect if you came here on a quiet Sun-Weds night, this would be a chill 5* experience. The model just doesn't quite work - delicious though the cocktails are - when they're busy.","review_date":"20/3/2018","category":"Food & Beverage"}

{"company_name":"Bar Stories","stars":"4","text":"Had a great time at this place. Always love finding a place with well-mixed cocktails, where the bartenders do actually care about what they're creating, and not just making a few bucks between here and grad school.\n\nFew disclaimers:\n1. We went on a Sunday night, and there were only 6 people in the entire place.\n2. It was on a business trip...so we weren't so concerned with the price\n\nMenu\nThere's no menu as some of the other reviews mentioned, so you'll start by telling the bartender (\"mixologist\" if you're fancy) the flavors you like, and the liquor. Let them know if you want something sweet or a bit more boozey too.  That will help you out. If you don't like your first cocktail - tell them what you didn't like. They're not offended, but will use that info to make you something better for round two.\n\nAtmosphere\nI'm not sure the name of our bartender, but we had a good time hanging out at the bar.  They're great to talk with...especially if you're a fan of a well-mixed cocktail.  The place is cozy - kind of at a random spot hidden in Haji Lane, but as some other reviewers mentioned, it's very small.  Probably would impact service, especially because all of the drinks are unique in some way. It's a low-key place too...rustic modern, so wear your skinny jeans and a button down with suede shoes. You'll fit right in haha. Just kidding - wear whatever you want. It's not a pretentious place.\n\nI have a few survival tips to get good treatment at this bar.\n1. Don't order a classic cocktail. You can tell them you like the flavors in a gin and tonic, but what's the point of going to a bar like this and ordering something you could get at every bar in the world? Let them do what they do best - create cocktails.\n2. Don't order anything with vodka. I personally don't drink vodka, and I don't have anything against it...but in the craft cocktail world, nothing makes a bartender's eyes roll than when you ask for vodka.\n\nLooking for adventure? Tell them you like spice. If you're never had a cocktail with muddled thai chilis, you should try one ASAP.","review_date":"21/11/2012","category":"Food & Beverage"}

I would also recommend bringing some extra clothes as they have really cranked up the air condition so irrespective of how warm it may be outside it is still chilly inside.\n\nOnce seated the friendly staff will discuss a bit what you like and what type of flavors you would like in your cocktail. I usually opt for something rum based and fresh and did so here as well. They also made sure to ask if there were any allergies or things we disliked and then they go to work.

In fact, the decor is remiscent of Maison Ikkoku which is another up and coming bar (some would even say it has arrived). We asked for drinks with pretty specific flavour profiles, and we got something that might have been acceptable, if not so watered down. It just had no soul - pardon my analogy - but like a brown girl trying to rap. Both our drinks.. it was a bit sad. \n\nBut we persevered on and this time asked a different guy at the bar to make our drinks. Looks like the trick worked - the kaffir lime/grapefruit tequila sour that I got was was excellent - a salty bitterness to the drink, plenty of acid and complexity. My husband asked for a penicillin which was all smoke and no fire. They did serve it with an interesting garnish though: an orange slice with 8 clove buds set on fire with a brulee torch. It added a wonderful nose to the drink.. but didn't make up for its obvious flaws. My drink too came with the kaffir lime being bruleed - I guess the folks at Bar stories share my love for the flame torch.\n\nIf I find myself in Arab street and in a generous mood, I might give Bar Stories a try again.

When these guys opened up and started making specialist cocktails in a shophouse on Haji Lane, people were interested. It was different. It was quaint. It was cool.\n\nBut this is 2013 and Bar Stories has been eclipsed by the likes of Jigger & Pony, Horse's Mouth, Cufflink Club, etc. The drinks just aren't that great and they have a habit of making embarrassing missteps, like serving cocktails in martini glasses that have not been chilled properly.\n\nAlso, the \"no menu\" bullshit is starting to wear thin and if you want to be a specialist cocktail bar it is totally unforgivable that you only have two single malt whiskeys available on any given night. That there is shameful.\n\nMoreover, you might offer patrons drinks with no name based on a flavour or a base spirit preference but if I order an old fashioned or a bloody mary and you don't execute well... why should I trust you with a random fruity concoction?\n\nSorry Bar Stories, every time I've been here I've been underwhelmed by the drinks and raised one eyebrow at \"the experience\".

{"company_name":"Bar Stories","stars":"4","text":"I've gone a few times and had dramatically different experiences. I've had 5 star experiences and 2 star, so overall 4 stars seems to make sense. So the general jist of the place is you go in and you get asked a few questions about your drink preferences and the bar tenders come up with something.\n\nSo first, for my positive experiences, I've always sat at the bar and it has been on slower nights (Tuesdays and Thursdays usually from my experience). Actually getting to interact with the bartenders as they make your drinks really makes the experience worthwhile. They actually pry further into what you like and you get to watch all the theatrics that go into making the drinks. The \"wow\" factor is pretty big when you get your super elaborate drinks. From the service pieces (everything from martini glasses to mason jars), to garnishes (candy, smoke, foams, etc), to pyrotechnics, it's all pretty impressive. And the drinks do actually taste quite nice, and it's not all just a show.\n\nSo my more negative experiences have been on busy nights seated at a table. For one, the waiters usually don't try as hard at getting to know your drink preferences as the actual bar tenders. The wait time for the drinks is SUPER long. Finally, what sucks the most is when they get backed up they put FAR less effort into your cocktail. Basically you usually end up with a fruity martini or the likes - not necessarily bad, but just disappointing.\n\nAt over $20 a drink, the former experience I mentioned felt worth it, but the latter felt like a rip off. So if you can catch the place on a slow night I highly recommend it, but if it's busy pass for a different night.","review_date":"23/1/2014","category":"Food & Beverage"}

If you would ask my husband, he would prefer Longplay, but I am sure this place would not be long behind.\n\nBar stories is located on Haji lane, a street where the Western and Middle-Eastern cultures collide. There are many bars around with tourists and expats having drinks, but also bars that serve no alcohol to respect the Arab-heritage. Bar stories is located in the upstair of an old shop-house. Its not a speakeasy per-se, but it is not something you wonder into without knowing what it is. \n\nUpon entering we were greeted and seated at the end of the bar. I love a seat with a view! The concept was as in Bitters & Love, there is no menu, you explain to the bartender what you like and they will make you a drink. We went with our usual spirits of choice, me wit gin and my date with a dark rum. We are perhaps a bit boring, but it helps compare. Also I am really not fond of whiskey, cognac or vodka as a base. The bartender also asked some questions like do I like lemongrass and could I handle some egg white in my drink (YES!). \n\nI could already see from the equipment they had at hand that we were going to see some party tricks. I don't mind as long as my drink is good. My dates cocktail arrived with a flaming branch or rosemary, and mine with a long lemongrass sticking out of the Martini glass. Looking around others had pretty cool looking drinks as well, and none of them looked the same. The staff seemed to like experimenting and you could see they were having fun with it. The taste was wonderful, like a mix of a fresh breeze and dessert (due to the creaminess of the egg white) with spices on top. \n\nWe only had one round of drinks this time, but I can imagine I could have sat there sipping on cocktails for a full evening. The ambience was charming and relaxed and the cocktails excellent. As with many nice bars these days, it is possible to reserve a table (I remember the days in Finland when it cost something and you only got a crappy bottle of Absolute Vodka and some mixers as \"compensation\"). There doesn't seem to be any food or snacks, so my recommendation would be to have dinner before going. \n\nBar Stories, I love you and I hope we meet again soon!","review_date":"12/3/2015","category":"Food & Beverage"}

First, the bartender was plain rude, refusing to seat us by the bar counter. Why - some (new, and very random) rule about not letting over 3 people of a group at the bar. Thats ok...if it's a fairly busy time. This was monday evening..and with literally 2-4 other customers during the entire time! so we were sent packing to a dingy corner, away from the action and fun.

The bar area is dimly lit for that vibey atmosphere. A hostess greets you and there's some lounge corners, a long communal table, the bar, and some additional seating a few stairs up. I recommend making a reservation if you're able to. Each cocktail is $28 SGD and then with service charge, GST fees, $33+ SGD per drink, so a pretty penny. \n\nFor a group of two coming at 7:30PM on a Wednesday, it was quite packed, but we were able to get a couple of seats at the bar. The menu is designed like a magazine for each drink and the front page has the table of contents in a grid table with the lightest alcohol content (or mocktails) on the top row to the highest percentage on the last. Then the columns I think are based on specific taste preference like sweet, sour, etc. \n\nOur server Gerald was amazing - friendly, knowledgeable, and good conversation! Everyone was very friendly and seeing the bartenders do their craft was really fun.\n\nWe tried Soy Milk Punch, Godfather, Greatest of All Time, and Ramos Gin Fizz. I like the Soy Milk Punch the best with the egg white foam top which was delicious.\n\nWe wanted to try some of the food items but we're running on a tight schedule.

{"company_name":"Jigger and Pony","stars":"4","text":"Jigger & Pony has the #5 spot on The World's 50 Best Bars list, so when we found ourselves staying a short walk away, we decided to check it out. The place takes reservations, and we grabbed the only one available, for a midnight seating. Crazytown for a couple of middle-aged parents, but we were only in Singapore for one night. We napped during the day and showed up ten minutes early.\n\nThe bar was on the lobby level of the Amara hotel, and we were welcomed in as soon as we arrived. It was a fun spot, attractive and lively, definitely a scene. I appreciated that the reservation came with seating, two stools right at the bar. There were three or four bartenders behind there at any given time, and they were young and friendly and seemed to be having a blast. I really liked the guy making our drinks, a sweet Korean dude who's lived in Singapore most of his life.\n\nWe ordered our cocktails from a beautiful \"menuzine,\" a full-color book with a page dedicated to each drink. The cocktails were quite elaborate, with tons of ingredients and complicated processes. We are the correct audience for this sort of over-the-top mixology, but to our surprise, the results were not entirely successful. The one I take issue with is the Perfect Manhattan, made with Woodford Reserve rye, Carpano Antica, Mancino Secco, stracciatella, and chocolate bitters. The rye was fat-washed with stracciatella ice cream, and the whole thing was garnished with a chocolate cherry. This sounded interesting, but was weirdly less tasty and balanced than the Manhattans we make at home, also with rye and Carpano.\n\nI did like our other three cocktails. The Ugly Tomatoes was nice, lightly sweet and savory, with Hendrick's Orbium gin, ugly tomatoes, kummel, and elderflower. The Yuzu Whisky Sour was solid, with Maker's Mark bourbon, yuzu marmalade, St. Germain, lemon, and egg white. The Peaches & Daisies was a lovely refreshing cocktail with Nikka Coffey grain whisky, lacto-fermented peach, cranberry, chamomile, and lemon.\n\nWe had a great time at Jigger & Pony, and I'd recommend it if you want a happening bar where you can sit and enjoy a fancy cocktail.

We started out with the Corpse Reviver and the Moscow Mule. I had the former and it's probably my new favorite cocktail ever. The presentation is great - I love the beautiful jelly - and the cocktail itself is a masterpiece. The jelly tastes like absinthe, but better, and it melts in your mouth  when you sip this sour, refreshing drink. The Moscow Mule was also excellent - a perfectly done Moscow Mule, and very gingery.\n\nFor round two, we opted for Bad Blood and the Butterfly Effect. However, they were actually out of Bad Blood. I was pretty bummed, mostly because I had very much wanted a drink in one of those cute pineapple cups!! So, the bartender was awesome enough to make me a different drink, not on the menu, in that cup. He asked my drink preferences specifying that It had to contain absolut elyx. What I got was an incredible, tart and fresh elder flower cocktail with real flowers in it! I was so impressed by the bartender and waitress' efforts to go above and beyond to make sure I had a happy experience. It made the night even better to have such great service (in addition to amazing cocktails). The Butterfly Effect was also excellent - the flavors were very complex and the drink was very strong!\n\nAgain, this was probably the best cocktail experience I've ever had, due to the combo of amazing drinks and stellar service.

I come here more often than I would like to readily admit on social media (no I am not an alcoholic... I hope). Fundamentally I come for the holy trifecta of hospitality: the drinks, the atmosphere & the service. Jigger & Pony scores highly on all fronts.\n\nAs far as the drinks go, these are some of the best classic cocktails you're likely to find this side of Japan. If an Old Pal demands 240 stirs then 240 stirs it shall receive. What is the appropriate type of brown spirit to use in an Old Fashioned? Talk to the bar manager and he will sort you out based on your palate. Whiskey sour with egg white or without egg white? It's all good over here.\n\nMixing booze into glasses with garnishes and serving them at $20++ is a dicey thing to do. People have different tastes, you can't please everyone and for that kind of money they will have higher expectations. But having extreme attention to detail, akin to a cocktail Zen Master, and politely inquiring about your patrons' pre-existing tastes and cocktail prejudices certainly goes a long way.\n\nMoreover the atmosphere at Jigger is excellent. It's rarely completely dead but never too crowded. The booths are very comfortable to sit for hours with a group of friends. The light is not too bright, not too dim and the music is at an appropriate volume for ambiance but doesn't kill conversations.\n\nThe service is friendly, polite and sometimes firm (but considering the horrors hospitality staff have to deal with this seems appropriate). The staff at Jigger will do their best to accommodate your requests as long as you're polite and understanding. Want to sit at the bar and talk the bartender's ear off? Sure, why not. \n\nWhen I started going to this place I knew none of the people that worked there (full disclaimer for bias-reporting purposes) but since being a regular there for over a year I consider them my friends.

So i left and forgot about this place for a few months.\n\nFast forward nine months later, i was entertaining a visiting exec and was tasked with finding the venue. Jigger & Pony constantly came up as recommended place, so i figured - why not, i'll give them a proper chance. So off we went, a party of 8 seated at one of their booths. It was comfortable enough seating but the table did get a bit crowded once we started ordering food.\n\nFood was great. we ordered meatballs, cold cut platter and and some sort of cheese melted on top of bread (but i forgot the name of this dish). All of them turned out excellent - far exceeded my expectation for bar food. Aside of this, they also constantly bring in free small sandwiches for you to nibble on. Other bars should take note of this - people love free food no matter how simple they are.\n\nCocktails were amazing - i get why they're named as one of the best cocktail bars in town. They have a selection of pre-dinner cocktails for $14 (usually $20) until 8pm, which i think is a total steal for the quality. I would recommend Moscow Mule (ginger beer!), Lavender Gimlet (gin and lavender) and Darjeeling Cooler.\n\nThe ambience and music makes it perfect for an after-work place, and you do see those type of people here especially with the place being so close to CBD. It reminds me of 28 hks minus the speakeasy factor. On top of that, service was top notch! We never felt neglected despite the place being pretty much full on Friday night.\n\nHighly recommended, will come back again.","review_date":"30/11/2013","category":"Food & Beverage"}

Even here in Singapore you can hop to any of the other \"speakeasies\" around and get identical drinks and setting.\n\nThe ambiance and staff are beyond cool for sure. It's just that my girlfriend and I both had cocktails that weren't good at all. She had two different types and both tasted almost like medicine (one was the SG50 special cocktail called Little Red Dot or something). I had two different types, and both were pretty bad (one was called Donkey Kong and it tasted a bit off but I drank anyways), one I even sent back (the one that is milky and tastes like a sugary and heavier version of a White Russian), and I know I don't have that picky of a palette.\n\nThe chips are, however, contagious as many other Yelpers have mentioned.

However, on my most recent visit, we were treated with one of the worst service experiences I have had in Singapore. I can usually turn a blind eye to over priced drinks and average quality, however, service is one factor that really makes or breaks it for me. \n\nNow, I'm not just talking about slow service or getting orders wrong or rude waiters, I am talking about it all... The lack of knowledge and unawareness of the waiters only become apparent when we asked for our bill at the end of the night. Firstly, we couldn't find a server to ask for the bill. When I went over to the cashier and asked them for our table's bill, they were unable to locate it, and apologized for being 'new' (I mean not everyone can be new now, can they?) They asked me to recount all the drinks we had and then attempted to re-do a bill. After this, it still took about 20 minutes for them to get us the bill and when they did, it was still wrong! They had charged us for a bottle that was not even ours. At this time, I was dealing with one of the servers who seemed to be pretty unaware and didn't really have a clue what was going on, moreover, he had no respect for his customers and spoke to me in the rudest manner possible and was actually yelling at me... I am not sure if he had been drinking on the job or he has no manners, both of which are terrible, but I have never been spoken to like this in my life and it was really the last straw for me. I am sorry, but Jigger has now been boycotted by me and my friends. I refuse to sponsor an institution which has zero regard for its customers and no sense of how to talk to a fellow human being. I am usually ok to deal with slow service, but we will not stand for ineptitude and downright rudeness. \n\nBy the way, even after all this, they bought us the wrong bill and overcharged us..........at which point we were so done that we just paid and got the hell out of the place.","review_date":"9/10/2015","category":"Food & Beverage"}

Unfortunately, it also exudes a vibe of overweight sweaty cashed-up Western tourists avoiding the heat and humidity in the darkest air-conditioned place they can find, which luckily for them is probably listed as one of the highlights of Singapore in whatever crappy guidebook they're using. \n\nTo be fair, the Raffles Hotel complex is pretty cool and worth a quick wander to soak up its historic elegance and charm -- I'd just be hard-pressed to name it as a highlight of Singapore when there are so, so many more awesome places to go to and sights to see in this city. \n\nIt was also very noisy and crowded on a weekday evening (around 8pm). Very hard to hear yourself think because of all the buzz and chatter around you. Of course, some might love that tourist energy and claim it's all part of the fun.\n\nAlso on offer are peanuts in their shells, which people take great relish in crushing and dropping on the floor, a la Texas Roadhouse.\n\nSo yeah, definitely stop in, have a look, splash out the money for a Sling if you really want to, but just go knowing what to expect. Then have a look at the charming Raffles building itself -- the courtyards are really lovely with lush tropical foliage set against the graceful white building, and at night you can have many of the corridors to yourself for photo ops.

I honestly thought that this would be on display. Sadly, no. It was a generic, hasty affair that was only stretched out to 90 minutes because of how long we had to wait for the complimentary satay sticks that is included in the package.\nSome truly disappointing examples of the experience were:\n1) When I asked if a specific kind of gin was needed, I was told \"yes, it needs gin\". Sooo, I presume any gin will do? I had to look at some recipes      later to find that I needed London Dry Gin.\n2) We were given a complimentary \"Recipe Card\" for the secrets of making the perfect Singapore Sling. This card has ingredients, but no measurements included. It's lucky I wrote them down after we finished making our drinks.\n\n(The measurements, btw, are 30ml London Dry Gin, 10ml Dom Benedictine, 10ml of  Cherry Liqueur, 10ml of Dry (Orange?) Curacao, 20ml of pineapple juice, 60ml of lime juice (or are those juices switched around?

This experience aspect all felt rushed, bordering on unprofessional and almost impatient to get it done.\n\nSadly, I do not recommend this experience to anyone, whether novice or expert in cocktails alike.

You crack open the shell, pop the peanut into your mouth, and throw the shells on the ground. There is also a live Filipino band that performs though the night we were there, it was more of a golden oldie type of band rather than a band who plays their rendition of current hits. I'm not sure if this the usual since I've only been once. Most guests are non-locals and I can understand why. Long Bar feels a little lackluster for those looking for a trendy place. For those with a colonial nostalgia, Long Bar is where you can spend a couple hours at in the evening. The Singapore Sling cocktail is S$27. That's a bit steep but hey, it's the Long Bar. Not gonna lie, I prefer an Old Fashioned cocktail anytime.","review_date":"12/6/2014","category":"Food & Beverage"}

{"company_name":"Long Bar","stars":"2","text":"Ready to tick 'Have a Singapore Sling at Raffles' off that bucket list? Ok then, best you get yourself to Long Bar. Bring money. \n\nI am going to give a completely honest review of this place. I have been to Singapore before and avoided this spot, but on a day when we had nothing to do and walked right past it we thought what the heck. We are tourists after all, let's see what the fuss is about. \n\nThe inside itself is quaint. Filled with old banker lights and fans that swing side to side. It's bustling at all times of day and night, filled with people from all over the world that have decided they 'must' get their Singapore Sling from Raffles. \n\nThat is where the charm begins and ends. To start, the drinks are priced to take advantage of tourists. A Singapore Sling will cost you $28++ and it's quite frankly, revolting. Let's be honest here, it's a terrible cocktail and they are pumping them out on mass so there is little care going into your drink. \n\nTo add insult, a pint of Tiger will cost you almost the same price. So for one cocktail and one beer, we were stung more than $50 plus tax. \n\nThere is the 'quirk' of it being the only place in town that allows littering, with the floor covered in empty peanut shells. I don't know how or why this is appealing. It's disgusting and your bar stool is likely covered in other people's filth. \n\nFinally there is the clientele. The \"bucket list\" crowd. Which by the look of the average age, could be just about any day now. Think cruise wear, grey hair. George Costanza's father would not look out of place here. \n\nSo there you have it.

We checked out Long Bar at Raffles Hotel after a trip around the Night Safari. We caught a cab straight to Raffles Hotel and had quite a bit of an adventure looking for this bar. Let me first say that we were there on a Tuesday night so we weren't exactly sure it would still be open. We were dropped off in front of the main doors of the hotel and didn't see a soul. So we walked around the premise of the hotel. We found a restaurant that with a sign on it saying that Long Bar was closed. We tried asking a worker for directions because the restaurant didn't look anything like what I imagined the bar to look like. The directions weren't very clear so we wandered around a bit. We went up and down the stairs and didn't find the place until we were about to give up. We probably spent 20-30 minutes wandering looking for it. \n\nBy the time we found the place, we were told that they were about to close but they allowed us in when we told them we just wanted a quick drink. They offered a number of different versions of the Singapore Sling. I've never had one before but I figured if I knew where it was invented, I should definitely try it. \n\nIt was very fruity and sweet and I quite enjoyed it. The first thing you will notice when entering the bar however, is that the floor is covered with peanut shells. They had a heaping bowl of peanuts on each table and customers are encouraged to just drop their shells on the floor. That was definitely unlike anywhere I've been in the past.\n\nI wish I could have found the place earlier and on the weekend because I wouldn't mind chilling their a bit longer. \n\nSo to summarize (if you don't want to read my all that): I liked the place.

There was some kind of Sanrio celebration going on, with decorations everywhere we looked. These included the largest Hello Kitty I've ever seen, welcoming travelers into the terminal.\n\nWe had some last-minute shopping to do, and had no problem finding souvenirs for our kids and niece. There was a vending machine that sold toy Singapore subway trains and I picked up a few merlion stuffies from the Kaboom toy store. I also browsed one of the many duty free shops just to try on a Chanel lipstick.\n\nAt some point, we utilized the SilverKris Lounge. This was a fantastic lounge, but it was also almost wasted on this airport, where lounging was low on our agenda. I was too full of crab to take advantage of the impressive buffet, but it was nice to sit down for a bit.\n\nWe left enough time to visit the butterfly garden on our way to the gate. Unfortunately, the butterflies were sleeping at eight at night (I guess even Singapore can't keep butterflies awake for tourists), but the garden was pleasant, and we got to see dozens of chrysalises on display, some of them twitching with emerging butterflies.\n\nWe only went through security after all of these adventures, at a small, efficient station set up at our gate. Changi is the only airport I've heard of that has security checkpoints at every gate. This was an unexpected convenience, one last luxury before we got on our plane.\n\nI'd heard that Changi was the best airport in the world, but honestly, that doesn't quite capture the extravagant splendor of this place. I hope to visit again and maybe see a movie at the free 24-hour theater, or stay at one of the on-site hotels. Even with a short layover, I'd be sure to hit Jewel for Jumbo Seafood and the Rain Vortex.","review_date":"31/12/2024","category":"Hotels"}

Instead of going the boutique way, such as in Bukit Timah establishment, CSHH is a full fledge cafÃ© serving Coffee, Coffee flavoured beer, food and desserts. At the back of the cafÃ©, you can see their workshop roasting machines. Beside the workshop is the Annex, this is where you can buy coffee beans and other coffee apparatus. The coffee school and gift shop can be located on the second floor. \n\nThis time around, I decided to pop by for a quick shot of caffeine and a quick bite before my next appointment in Novena. \n\nThe coffee here can be considered as one of the best roasted coffee beans in Singapore. Just check with the crowds flocking this place every day. With the third wave coffee movement hitting its stride in Singapore, you can be sure that you will get a good cuppa just by judging the Rosetta latte art in your coffee. If it does not have one or the rosetta does not look good, you better lower your expectations. \n\nMost of the time, CSHH will be using their own blend of coffee bean which is known as Terra Firma for their milk base coffee, such as cappuccino, latte, other variety. Their coffee is smooth, dark with a slight chocolate flavour at the end. The best part, is that you will not need to add sugar into it.\n\nFor food, this is the first time around I have a grub here. Ordered The BLT sandwich, and it does not disappoint. The bacon and bread is nice and crispy. The tomato and lettuce inside the sandwich is fresh. They serve the sandwich with chips and mesclun salad with Italian dressing. \n\nOverall, the quality of the coffee here is excellent. The top 3 best coffee in Singapore in my opinion.

But the place on weekends is a madhouse. \n\nNo table service means long queues to order coffee. I've sometimes had to wait 15 minutes in queue just to get an order in. Hell if they were serving $1 kopitiam stuff I'd probably be fine with that but considering the prices here, a bit of table service wouldn't be too much to ask. But if people are willing to queue then table service would probably be bad business.\n\nSimilarly, I assume, comfortable seating with ample space would be bad business. Why give people space & comfort when you can pack them in & contort them like sardines? Turn those covers! Good business, Papa.

You can come here for three things:\n1. A coffee.\nBeans are roasted by the team in their other locations, but operations will be centralised to the Workshop (in the adjacent building in the near future). \nYour beverage is made before you, in the island bar, and you can see the baristas in action, no matter if it's an espresso-based coffee, or one of the many other filter brews.\n\n2. On quieter days, a conversation.\nTalk to the baristas - the island bar is built for interaction, and ask them why the do things a particular way. Like why your filter coffee has water poured in a particular fashion, and the importance of the right temperature.\n\n3. A taste experience.\nIf you're a little more keen, call ahead to book a session at the Annex. You can geek out with a few of your friends over the intricacies of flavour in each small-batch-roasted origin, and even get some off-the-menu treats as flavour pairings.\n\nIf you're mega-geeking it out, there's number 4.

{"company_name":"Chye Seng Huat Hardware","stars":"5","text":"CSHH is the new flagship venue of the Papa Palheta group. Located on Tyrwhitt Road (beside Jalan Besar stadium), CSHH is a roastery, retail space and coffee academy. The Steeping Room - previously a pop up space at Bras Basah - makes a welcome return in the form of the Annexe, a dedicated area for coffee and food pairing.  \n\nPapa Palheta cafes tend to have a very distinct decor, feel and atmosphere - CSHH is no exception. The original shell of the hardware store is intact, with art deco lettering and exposed light fixtures enhancing the effect. The interior is bright, airy and contemporary - a new lease of life for one of the old workshops that was here before. Combined with a large retail space, this is not unlike Barista Jam in Sheung Wan, Hong Kong - a venue I like a lot.  \n\nAs always, I started by ordering an Espresso. The blend used was a combination of \nBrazilian Coromandel, Guatamelan Antigua and Ethiopian Sidamo. In general, Brazilian and Guatamelean coffees have hints of chocolate, and low acidity, while Ethiopian sidamo has a smooth aftertaste. The shot had an intense aroma, with a dark brown crema, indicitave of freshly roasted beans. There was a syrupy mouthfeel that I typically notice in shots from third wave outlets - this is an indicator that the shot has been extracted for the correct amount of time. The intensity and robust body of the shot was evident from the first tasting - the combination of dark chocolate paired with a citrus, floral notes gives rise to a complex, long lasting bouquet with perfect balance. The aftertaste lingers, and I could taste it long after I had finished my shot. Some things are simply better in their places of origin - like eating chicken rice in Singapore, or drinking Guinness in Dublin, drinking a Papa Palheta blend in CSHH was a coffee experience to savour. There were more notes, flavour and mouthfeel in the last few drops than in any number of shots from other cafes.\n\nI ordered a Cappuccino also. It arrived with beautiful latte art and dark brown foam - a nice contrast of light and darkness. There was a lovely foamy, light texture with an intense coffee hit a few seconds later. The espresso did not dominate in this drink, even though it was a strong shot - the milk and espresso work in conjunction, a 1-2 punch straight to the pallete, where one hits right after the other. They accentuate each other rather than fight for dominance on your taste buds. The layer of foam on top was the correct thickness also - a simple thing, but not something that every cafe gets right.\n\nThe retail space is large and well stocked, with Chemex woodneck products, Hario Buono kettles paired with V60 pourover rigs, Aeropress and syphons all on display. There were 5 bean varities available also, which can be bought whole, or ground on request. Professional espresso machines and grinders are available. This is significant - the staff are are baristas who use machines such as these each day, rather than sales people who may receive commission for recommending a particular type.\n\nSome other notable points are the menu, which has a wide variety of brewing types, and clever pairings of food to coffee. Also, I like the pairing of Jungle Beer (brewed in Admiralty) and Papa Palheta coffee - this is entirely consistent with the creative approach of Papa Palheta. I have not yet tried the Annexe, where food, coffee and alcohol pairings are explored more fully, but based on the work that has been done in CSHH to date (and from one or two experiments that are being prepared at present), this is something to look forward to.\n\nIn short, it's some of the best coffee that I've had. The original Papa Palheta at Hooper Road may be no more, but the same intense, robust and complex shots live on in a quiet street at Jalan Besar.","review_date":"18/3/2013","category":"Food & Beverage"}

The main theme is to examine issues related to Singaporeans as individuals as well as a community, and to see Singapore through its art.\n\nOutside the main gallery (DBS Singapore Gallery) is the Social Table, which let visitors digitally choose a collection of artworks and build their own posters (see picture).  Once you are done you'll enter your email address, and the poster will be emailed to you in a jpeg file.\n\nThis is REALLY cool because the artworks that you select represent how you see Singapore through its art.  Each person's selection is unique; each person's perspective of Singapore is different.  Your selection is your answer to the question \"Siapa Nama Kamu?\"\n\nIn the picture posted, you can see yours truly's view of the culture and evolution of Singapore through its art, and my answer to the question \"What is your name?\"  My name is my image of Singapore.\n\nBesides the main feature, there were numerous other exhibits and galleries.  There are literally too many to mention, but two of them are particularly memorable:\n\n-- Rediscovering Treasures: Ink Art from Xiu Hai Lou, which is a collection of Chinese painting and calligraphy.\n\n-- Walk, Walk, Walk: Search, Deviate, Reunite, which is a digital collection from Japanese \"ultratechnologists\".

I swear I spent 50% of my time here trying to figure out where to go. We got lost like 5 times, and it was really frustrating to just walk to empty or closed rooms. After a while we realized that a bunch of exhibits were actually closed, so it was a bummer that nobody let us know in advance, instead of wasting our time trying to figure out where to go. At the end we just felt so lost and cold in that huge building that we decided to leave. \n\nIf you are visiting Singapore just for a few days, I would skip this museum; I wouldn't consider it a MUST.","review_date":"29/3/2018","category":"Arts"}

I've heard stories of the occupation but never visited an exhibit showcasing the documents and personal accounts beforehand. There is also a cute room with a heartwarming story of how a couple fell in love during those harsh times. This exhibit gave me great insight into the Japanese occupation and I loved every moment. \n\nThe main exhibit, History of Singapore, is large, comprehensive, and beautiful.

Learned about the history of Singapore which I didn't know much about. Really liked the sculpture or is it a display of all the pots and pans making a huge sphere in the entrance. I didn't have time to see the rest of the museum but apparently goes into detail for specific eras in history. I enjoy historical museums a lot more than art museums so this was good.

{"company_name":"National Museum of Singapore","stars":"5","text":"Any nations you go for the first time it is respectful to learn  about their history and culture. A museum like \"The National Museum Of Singapore\" would be the best example. Underneath the glitzy hotels, and swanky retails.  lies a more profound Singapore. A history that started with the entire nation being tropical agrarian land.  Before the arrival of the westerners,  it was more \"Man Vs Wild\" than \"Crazy Rich Asians \".  \n    It starts off with the indigenous people aka the Malays and their methods of cultivating land. Then the arrival of Chinese mainly from provinces of Hainan and other parts of south China who arrived as early as the 11th century. Both groups worked along side each other in the jungles. Later traders from India mostly from Tamil arrived. Museum murals depicted how each of the groups worked side by side.\n    Later segments in museums depicts the arrival of Europeans and especially Stamford Raffle the founder of modern Singapore.  It focus the control of Singapore under the British East India Company. It was still a colony with current day Malaysia known as British Malaya  until 1962 when it joined Malaysia as a soverign nation. \n     Rest of the museum focused on its succession from Malaysia in 1965 and the formation of todays Singapore which is the modern metropolis of success.","review_date":"3/10/2019","category":"Arts"}

It includes the Singapore Living Galleries (namely on food, fashion, photography, fashion, and film & wayang) and the Singapore History Gallery.

There are even videos on the process of preparing the local dish, which keeps people interested and easy for tourists to understand our culture as well!\n\nI like the Singapore History Gallery as well. Firstly, it takes on a story telling approach, which makes it more engaging. It covers the major national events in the development of Singapore, as well as personal stories of people from the past. It comes with an easy-to-operate multimedia handheld device called the companion, which facilitates the audio visual tour.

The main Singapore history gallery has information dating back to about 800AD and forward to the economic powerhouse that it's become - careful to point out that Singapore existed before Raffles landed and \"started\" it. Plus for the WWII buff in me, the downstairs traveling exhibit covers the experience under Japanese occupation. I wish some of the exhibits had gone in to a bit more detail - I'm the guy who loves the most minute details about some of this stuff, but all in all, worth visiting. More expensive than the nearby Asian Civilizations Museum, but definitely covering very different content.","review_date":"12/10/2017","category":"Arts"}

In the exhibition on treasures from Ukraine, there is a bit at the end describing the importance of gold in Asian cultures as well. \n\nThe permanent exhibitions are also quite worth exploring to find out about Singapore and our history. The Singapore History Gallery, in particular, offers a very personal interactive experience with your own audio companion and different paths that you can take throughout the exhibit.

{"company_name":"National Museum of Singapore","stars":"5","text":"Absolutely phenomenal. The NMS is one of the best museums I have every visited.  Beautiful building with terrific architecture both inside and out. For the main admission fee of $15 SGD, you get access to several art galleries and two exhibits on Singapore history. There is also one special exhibit that you need to pay extra for, which I opted not to pay extra for.  The art exhibits are okay (full disclosure I only had time to check out two), but in my opinion, the stars of the show are the history exhibits. There is one of the first floor that offers a fairly comprehensive overview of Singapore's history starting from pre-European contact through the present. I felt like I really learned a lot about the different eras in Singapore's history and there were plenty of cool artifacts, along with mNy different oral histories that you could listen to by picking up the receivers places along the walls. The past 100 years of Singapore was a smaller exhibit upstairs in a beautiful wing of the building. This was split into four parts, each in a different room: pre-war colonial era (through 1930s), Japanese occupation (1940s), post war / independence (1950s and 60s) and the beginning of the modern era (1970s and 80s). Each room gave an interesting snapshot of the era depicted. My favorite was the last one covering through the 1980s. It was quite elaborate, with a giant mosaic screen in the far wall facing two rows of stadium seats that were taken from the original Singapore Stadium. The screen changed every 30 seconds or so to show a new scene. There was also a second smaller room behind the giant screen that was set up like a drive in theatre complete with mock up cars that you could sit in to watch the short film that was playing on repeat. Brilliant.  Visit this museum. If you don't, you're really missing out.","review_date":"25/11/2018","category":"Arts"}

{"company_name":"Scotts Flowers NYC","stars":"3","text":"Seems like a solid event and delivery florist (ie $75+ bouquets), with very helpful staff, but I wasn't especially impressed by the selection of $30-$50 bouquets. The first tome I came in I was looking for a simple bouquet to bring as a hostess gift, and wasn't won over by the premade options. The guy helping me asked what I was looking for, so I gave him my budget and color scheme. He assembled a bouquet in the back, and presented it to me for approval. I thought it was kind of tacky, so I asked for a few of the ugly flowers and fillers to be swapped, like requesting eucalyptus instead of decorative green berries. He invited me to look in the fridge to pick stems out myself, which was perfect. The bouquet ended up being just what I wanted, simple, classy, and within my $30 budget. \n\nI liked it so much, in fact, that I returned with a coworker to purchase a bouquet for our supervisor's birthday. That experience was less stellar. We described what we were looking for and our price range ($35-40), and the staff member went to the back to have it assembled. After making us wait for more than 15 minutes, he presented a bouquet that looked really tacky. We asked that he swap the berries and Christmas-y elements for simpler foliage/flowers, and he returned awhile later with a bouquet that would only marginally nicer. When we hesitated, he intoned that the flowers he used were usually more expensive that the original ones, implying that he was doing us a big favor. The whole process was slow and uncomfortable; we paid and left even though we didn't love the bouquet. \n\nTLDR; the premade bouquets are mediocre, so satisfaction depends on who helps you put together a custom bouquet.","review_date":"12/12/2018","category":"Retail"}

Not being a huge fan of national floral delivery companies, I was looking for a locally owned florist.  I ran across Scotts and was drawn to their arrangement photos on their website.  The online ordering looked easy enough but I called to place my order because I wanted some recommendations.    The sales person was friendly, helpful and offered suggestions.  I mistakenly thought they were physically located closer to my sister's home so there was a small additional delivery fee, which was disclosed to me at the beginning of our conversation.  I ordered the day before for delivery by 5pm the next day.   They arrived the next day  around noon, in plenty of time for her birthday dinner.

The atmosphere is calming even though there is so much to look at due to the lofty open space, the dÃ©cor, and the ambient music played.

I enjoyed the smell of their incense when I used to walk around in that location and the sounds and sight of the waterfall in the stairwell\n\nSome of the positive aspects about the new location is that it's closer to Canal Street train station, it's not on a crowded side of Broadway like the old location, they still carry the same items you would have seen in the old location, there's a gallery located on the 2nd floor and the company/store utilizes social media a lot more. Some of the negative aspects are that it's technically only one floor of merchandise so this location isn't as big as the other location and the staff like the former location aren't as socializing. \n\nThe merchandise and cultural items really do bring a pop and vibrancy into the store, but I feel the atmosphere, flooring, walls, and the restroom need a serious update. I know some people enjoy that old-like interior and decor, but I feel the store would look better if the flooring and walls had an update. \n\nOverall, I am happy they've decided to reopen and i would definitely bring friends or family from outside of NYC to visit here if they are looking for cultural items that they may not have from where they live.

After pickng it up, she put the toy down only to be ***SCOLDED*** by a Pearl River Mart employee for not putting the toy back in its original, \"correct\" location.  \n\n(1) This is a totally absurd reaction by the Pearl River Mart employee  (this is a store and people are allowed to look, touch and freely move merchadise around); and\n\n(2)  My daughter DID NOT place the toy in the wrong location, it was in the worng location to BEGIN WITH.\n\nI will NEVER patronize a store that treats its youngest customers in such a fashion.  Outright RUDE and ridiculous.

There are multiple levels for your shopping pleasure.\n\nThis is by far one of the best places to find a unique gift for anyone for whom you might be shopping and I double dutch dare you not to find something that you simply must have for yourself.  I subscribe to the shopping theory: one for you, at least one for me.\n\nI love that this place is beautifully organized and very clean. Everything has it's place and is neatly shelved or displayed.\n\nOn my last visit, I had to use the rest room about which I was nervous....which is my usual state of mind prior to entering any public bathroom particularly in a store this size and in NYC.  I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't have to turn on my heels and run out.

I love that jacket.   I didn't find any items I had to have this time but it was probably more to do with the fact that I had less shopping time than I typically allow myself here.

{"company_name":"Pearl River Mart","stars":"5","text":"My history with Pearl River goes back to being a young kid being dragged along on shopping trips to Chinatown by my mother.  Back when Pearl River resided on Canal Street, the store was a gigantic space that had a much more industrial feel than its modern day counterpart.  I remember my mother relying on them for various kitchen appliances and housewares and we rarely left Pearl River empty handed.\n\nFast forward decades and Pearl River as a store and brand has undergone quite the evolution over time.  Gone are the rice cookers, pots and pans etc. and in are fun T-shirts, beautiful cards and in a bit of a nod to the past, there are still kitchen items including elegant bowls and chopsticks.   Another bit of the \"old\" Pearl River still survives in the form of a fabric section in the back where you can purchase yards of fabric for your projects.  Once upon a time such stores were common in Chinatown, but in the 2020's that is no longer the case.\n\nThis new location emerges out of the ashes of the pandemic.  Before COVID hit, Pearl River lost its gigantic multi-level store on Broadway (which was quite a sight to see years ago) and then their smaller store on Walker Street.  I think however that everything worked out for the best as this space suits them much better.  The space is beautifully renovated, wide open with tall ceilings and bright lighting.  The back area has even been converted into a small art gallery focusing on artwork by Asians.\n\nI have a deep affection for the Pearl River brand and it does my heart good to see it continues to survive to this day.

As recommended by an employee, regardless of your pet preference (cats rock!), you really need to buy both patterns to get the joke. \n\nThe items are a bit expensive but I'm okay with that since the goods are just so neato. Plus the employees are actually nice and smile. Just be careful wandering around the store since there are so many breakables around. That's my ultimate nightmare, breaking a table of glasses in Fishs Eddy.","review_date":"19/10/2015","category":"Retail"}

Stripes, polka dots, pure white, off-white, orange, blue, handle or without- well, you get the picture. I'm admittedly obsessed. \n\nI can't be in Union Square without feeling the impulsive urge of stopping at Fishs Eddy and indulging in housewares or MORE mugs that I probably (actually, DEFINITELY) don't need. Although I'm usually confused about how to pronounce it (Fish and Eddy? IS THE \"S\" SILENT?!) As I enter the store I'm overwhelmed (in a good way) and consumed by nostalgia that takes me back to a childhood in the country side I've never even had. Yes- the houseware at Fishs Eddy is so beautifully retro yet modern I feel obliged to conjure up some false memories of a life in the country, of milk delivered by a milkman in glass bottles when really, let's be real, I grew up in this concrete jungle where we buy milk at the corner bodega that unfortunately comes in a ugly plastic jug. Yeah, a girl can dream though. They have it all here- anything you might need, the sky's the limit- or consult your credit limit. Things get pretty pricey up in here! Worth it if you ask me. \n\nSo besides my obsession with mugs, why do I love Fishs Eddy so much? Well, when I enter Fishs Eddy, I submerge myself in an alternative world where I grew up in the country, ate farm fresh eggs everyday, the milkman came every morning without fail and my mother taught me how to make the PERFECT apple pie. \n\nFishs Eddy is obviously my escape from reality.

{"company_name":"Randazzo's Clam Bar","stars":"3","text":"Cuisine: 6\nService: 7\nDecor: 5\nValue: 6\nOverall: 6\n\nBeen here a few times and really wanted to like the place due to its history. unfortunately, it does not live up to the hype and felt like a run of the mill seafood joint. For this review, I will simply focus on the meal I had this past weekend, which was a similar feeling I had experienced in previous visits.\n\nFirst of all, we walked in hoping to get some fried soft shell crabs while they are in season, which were prominently displayed on their specials menu. Sadly they sold out of them the day prior. Then we asked for steamers, but they didn't have that either. We were quite disappointed. Regardless, we march on since there is a bevy of seafood to choose from. Here is a list of what we had.\n\nTop Neck Clams (9/10) - Maybe some of the best clams I have ever had. Fresh, plump, clean, sweet, and utterly delicious. So good in fact, we got a second order.\n\nLittle Neck Clams (6/10) - These weren't bad, but definitely not as plump or sweet as the Top Neck Clams. Clearly a briny taste, and had sand in few of them.\n\nBlue Point Oysters (6/10) - Never been a fan of Blue Point Oysters, probably because they are so bland. Honestly, these were well shucked and extremely clean, good meaty size and fresh for sure, but flavorless as expected.\n\nSpicy Crab Corn Chowder (3/10) - Literally no crab flavor at all, just a thick, creamy, and spicy corn chowder that I can easily make better at home. One of the saddest dishes.\n\nFried Scallop Sandwich (6/10) - The scallops were over-fried a bit and not as juicy or tender as they should be. The batter was also a tad thick. With that said, it was decent without the bread, which was just a toasted hamburger bun.\n\nShrimp Randazzo (4/10) - Looks can be deceiving. Everyone else was ordering it, so we did too. Unfortunately, the watery sauce had barely any flavor. Pasta is simply from a box. The shrimps were fine, mussels were okay, but the clams were grossly overcooked.\n\nOur server was very sweet and friendly, though sometimes it was hard to get her attention when she was on her phone. The space is old school clam bar, but prices were not cheap. I would absolutely swing back for some of those unbelievably great Top Neck Clams, but unlikely to stay for a full meal in the future.","review_date":"29/4/2024","category":"Food & Beverage"}

The Lobster roll-dry and chopped like tuna fish with lots of celery and no flavor- barely any lobster either. \nMuscles served in tomatoey water which they also served the pasta in. The Calamari was so- so. \nOur waitress was fine, but she asked two different girls to bag up our baby's leftovers more than twice and they both ignored her and did something else while we waited more than 10 minutes for the check.

It's served with your choice of \"medium sauce\" or \"hot sauce\" (or both), but that's kind of a misnomer. The \"hot sauce\" is barely spicy and has more of a mild smoky and peppery flavor. The medium sauce is just a sweeter version of marinara sauce. \n\nI was a little let down by the pasta dishes. We ordered the shrimp fra diavolo with linguine and rigatoni vodka. The pasta itself was cooked well in both dishes. The fra diavolo sauce was fantastic (perfect combo of tangy, sweet and a hint of spicy) but unfortunately the seafood was subpar. I was also not a fan of the vodka sauce - it's much creamier and cheesier than any vodka sauce I've had and, while this might be a matter of personal preference, it was not for me.\n\nOverall, surprised this made this year's NYTimes top 100 list.","review_date":"18/8/2024","category":"Food & Beverage"}

The last time I had a hot sauce it was like someone took a jar of Tabasco and microwaved it and called it \"hot sauce\" nah doesn't work. Also the breading overwhelms the delicate nature of the calamari Back to Brooklyn I go. Find a parking space on the same block! That was a miracle. You walk in and its like coming home again. It almost seemed as though the same waitstaff was there! The place is always busy but the people there never forget to be polite and above all welcoming. Once seated the waitress got us menus which definitely were not needed. We placed our order and while we were waiting we were informed of some specials which sounded very yummy but my mission was to dive into a big order of calamari  with the hot sauce on the side. The whole place just had that air of familiarity and warmth. Now if I can only convince them to open a place close to me all would be perfect but there is nothing like the original and only!

This item is not on the menu, but I wanted to try it as I had seen yelp photos of it beforehand. The octopus was delicious, perfectly tender. I wish that it was a little bit more charred on the outside, though and have a little bit more seasoning. \n\nFor entrÃ©es, my friend and I ordered crabcakes sandwich and lobster roll.

Lobster roll was good, came on a burger bun. The meat taste of fresh, and the dressing was pretty good with celery and mayonnaise. I do wish we got a little bit more lobster or the meat was chunkier.

The differences are stark, but I am not here to compare the two, this is not Lenny's. \n\nOne of the prides of this restaurant is the Pasta Marechiara, a blend of linguini pasta (the right choice of pasta), in a light sauce with finely chopped shrimp, clams, and calamari. It is tasty and there is enough seafood in the dish to make you wonder if there is any left in the ocean. I will never complain about that.\n\nWhat I will complain about is everything else. The borderline rude staff (to be fair, today is Mother's Day, so I will try to give them the benefit of the doubt), and the bland tasting options I ate in addition to the above. I had a lobster bisque soup with barely any lobster and found it lacking in any other substance. The fried calamari appetizer had zero taste. In fact, the hot tomato sauce that came with it ruins it because it is too hot.\n\nI understand this is not Maine, other parts of New England, or any seafood town along the Chesapeake Bay, but this seemed rather rushed and thrown in front of me than a sense of love and appreciation for our nautical neighbors.","review_date":"14/5/2023","category":"Food & Beverage"}

World Class.\n\nLeft Brooklyn, got married, so obviously I stopped going as often as I used too, but every time I come home we usually go out for Randazzo's . \n\nThe days of perfectly baked clams and fried calamari are gone -\nAND THEY AIN'T EVER COMING BACK. \nThe Talent in the kitchen has been replaced with god knows who, and the food has been going consistently downhill for around 3 years now.\n\nWe ordered Calamari and 2 Dozen baked clams to start, and neither one came out right.\nThe Calamari had that rubber consistency, which is the same problem I had the LAST time we were in, but the worst offense was the Baked Clams. \nThey looked normal when they came out, but underneath the bread crumbs\nthe clams that were \"supposed\" to be baked, were wet, slimy, and lukewarm.\nYep, these were one click above raw.\n\nThe waitress ( who is very nice, and I don't blame her ) knows us, and knew something was wrong when we left 22 of them ( the other 2 had to be spit into napkins... disgusting ) .\nShe asked the problem and I honestly didn't want to tell her. \nI didn't want to piss anyone off in the kitchen since we had already ordered our entrees and still had ALOT of food coming....\n She said please, let me send it back and they'll make it right.\n\nAs a rule of thumb - I DO NOT DO THIS.\nShe pretty much insisted and assured us that it would be fine, she always remembers us ( she should, she's a great server and we ALWAYS take very Good care of her ), and she wants to take care of this because she knows they're our favorite, etc.etc.  We let her take it back.\n\nNow they come back out at the same time as our entrees. Whatever.\nI try one of the baked clams and AGAIN - SAME F**kin THING. \n \nOnto dinner. My linguini was undercooked. \nThis guy's got a f**kin problem back there.....\nThere were 4 of us. \n2 of us said their food tasted \" OK\" ,\nMyself and my cousins entrees were downright bad.\n\nWithout prompting, the waitress apologized and deducted the baked clams from the bill.\nIt really didn't matter at that point, I think she could tell. \nListen, we took really good care of her and said Thanks for Everything and we meant it. This isn't her fault. \nWe left.\n\nWhen we got in the car we had a family discussion about our past few visits   and we all came to the same Sad Conclusion ..... \nThe food is either mediocre on a good day now, to inedible on a bad day.\nIt's basically become an overpriced tourist trap that's living off it's old reputation and location.\nWe're never going back. \nEnd of an Era.","review_date":"10/8/2024","category":"Food & Beverage"}

This is an old school place and it was crowded. The service if I recall correctly was fine.\n\nWe ordered the following dishes:\n\nSpicy crab/corn chowder\nLobster bisque\nSpaghetti with shrimp/lobster sauce\nFried zucchini\nMixed fried seafood platter (filet, shrimp, scallop, oyster)\nMixed seafood appetizer with French fries (scungilli [conch,] mussels, shrimp, calamari)\nFried flounder with baked potato\nLobster rolls with baked potato (and more fried zucchini)\n\nI remember the chowder being excellent. The bisque was good. The spaghetti had good texture but we'd probably just get the fra diavlo sauce instead of the shrimp/lobster. The fried zucchini was good. The mixed seafood/fried seafood was also fine. The fried flounder was easily the weakest thing but  I'd describe this place more for shellfish rather than fish fish. Special note to the particularly good lobster roll. Sure it was pricey but it was the biggest one I have found.  Just odd that it's served on a brioche which made it a bit bready compared to the usual. Still very tasty.\n\nAnd yes their spicy sauce goes perfect with the seafood.

Bourdain visited this place and Pete Wells still has it on his 100 best restaurants in NYC. If this makes the cut, there may only be 99 edible restaurants in New York. The only good thing about Randazzo's is that when the owners arrived around 7 pm, they were very friendly. \n\nLike everyone else, we wanted to love Randazzos.\n\nMy wife and I got to Randazzo's at 5:50 on Friday evening. We were very excited and were sat immediately. We did not get any water until 6:23. The entire restaurant was full of other hungry tables patiently waiting on their food. Everyone seemed to be waiting an extremely long time for their food. No servers checked in on an us and the place was very well staffed. For a menu of fried food, I am not exactly sure what the extreme delay was. Randazzo's needs a serious management overhaul. \n\nThe calamari arrived and it tasted like standard calamari with a decent hot sauce. Shockingly, the calamari was completely ungarnished. No lemon. No banana pepper. Nary a piece of parsley. \n\nI had the steamed lobster with a side of fried zucchini. The fried zucchini was pretty good and the steamed lobster was satisfactory. My wife's Lobster Randazzo arrived five minutes prior and my steamed lobster was lukewarm. I imagine it was left sitting for a while.\n\nThe pricing added insult to injury: one calamari appetizer, a Lobster Randazzo, and a Steam Lobster came to $140 before tax and tip.\n\nIf nothing else Randazzo's is certainly consistent.

We ordered the littleneck clams, shrimp fra divola pasta (came with actual clams and shrimp) and a clam linguine (just chopped up clams) pasta. The little necks were good, but 6 for $10 is sorta pricey, but oh well I wanted clams. The pasta dishes took a bit to come but not a ridiculously long time. We also asked for additional plates since we were sharing. I think the shrimp fra divola dish was better than the clam linguine, but my friend preferred the clam linguine. I preferred the shrimp pasta because it was a tad spicy and had more flavor, but my friend thinks the sauce was too salty and overpowered the dish, so he preferred the clam linguine. The clam linguine was a bit plain for me, but not bad. \n\nService at the counter was also pretty good.

{"company_name":"Randazzo's Clam Bar","stars":"4","text":"Came here on a whim after hearing so much about it. Even when I lived in the Bronx my grandma would mention driving down to Brooklyn for this, which speaks to its legacy and demand. That being said, it was destined to be tried. \n\nWe started with a large calamari dish, for me, reminiscent of the late Roccos Calamari(if youre from the bay ridge/dyker heights area). This is soft, tender, incredibly fried calamari with a well complimenting tomato sauce.\n\nEntree wise, my uncle had a lobster roll, one of the biggest I have seen, for a great price point. I have never seen this man unable to finish food, but when we found him picking off bread to maximize lobster, we knew this was the one. Other than that, I had the stuffed shrimp, and honestly it was disappointing. Every other dish came as a great portion size and was very well presented. This was meh. Decent flavor, and then shrimp is shrimp, its always good but so much more could be done with this.\n\nThe days winner by far was my wifes seafood fra diavolo that had her pulling out full lobster tails. This is honestly for two people. I literally took half, including all mussels and clams, and not only was she full, but she had some to take home. Well after we crossed the finish line, we were still sliding bread through that delicious sauce.\n\nGreatly appreciated good food and hospitality, now I know where to go when in the sheepshead bay area.","review_date":"26/5/2019","category":"Food & Beverage"}

This should be called lobster puree - there was not one single piece of lobster in the cup.  It had not even a single hint of tasting like lobster.  The linguini was cooked nicely and although it looked to be very tasty, it was extremely dry with a small amount of sauce in the dish.  Portion size was very nice.  There was barely a taste of garlic and though a lot of chopped clams, they had simply no taste.\nNO BREAD - I ordered a pasta dish and they served no bread with it.  So I questioned myself.  Went home and visited over 15 websites which clearly indicate Bread Is Serviced with Pasta!  Where's the bread Randazzos?\n\nCost -  Extremely high.  2 Pasta dishes, one cup of soup, 1 tiny bottle of white wine, 1 can diet coke  $ 118.00 + tip n tax.

Amazing oysters actually. And my meal was starting very well! It was extremely sweet oysters and adding that sour lemon made an amazing combination.\nThen the second plate was the Steam Littleneck Clams. This was absolutely disappointing. It's said to be cooked with white sauce, but all I could taste was watery sauce. It was bland with no taste. The garlic in it did not even help the flavor. And dipping the bread in the sauce was like bread with water. \nLastly, the pasta wad the same as littleneck clams. I ordered White Clams Sauce Pasta and it was all soggy and no taste. Just like I said, everything was BLAND. \nAt this point the food wasn't enough to fill me up but I just couldn't order more because I knew it would all taste the same. Bland. Tasteless.\n\nNow, as for the service, i had 2 waiters. One was very nice lady who took my orders and the other just threw the plates to my table. Moreover I was sitting in a table of 4 and the lady just threw the plates to the other end of the table instead of putting it in my side. I was not mad, but since the US have this system of tipping certain percentage, I would rather tip for a better service.\n\nThe reason for 3 stars is only because of the seafood freshness otherwise I would give lower. \nI hope they change back to the good old restaurant that was before.

She, and the restaurant in general, was very laid back and very welcoming.  It's a comfortable place that, unlike so many restaurants now, doesn't blare music or TV, doesn't try to upsell you every 15 seconds, and doesn't mess with classics.

{"company_name":"Randazzo's Clam Bar","stars":"4","text":"Just as advertised!\n\nTo be honest, prior to my latest visit I never knew Randazzo's was featured on Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations in 2012, and nor did I need it to be featured on that show to know that this institution existed near me. For almost all of my life, I lived near one of the great seafood establishments in Brooklyn, located way too far south for some to \"trek\" to, but very well worth the long train ride.\n\nI had once visited the restaurant a long time ago, way before I knew what good food was, so it only made sense for me to make the pilgrimage back ... and that time was now! I dropped in with my wife on MLK day and the restaurant was fairly quiet compared to the spring and summer nights where I passed by. By the end of the evening when we left at 8pm, the restaurant only had 6-7 parties inside, which we honestly did not mind since it was nice and peaceful.\n\nFrom the moment we stepped in, till the moment we left, the service was fantastic. ALL, and I cannot stress this enough, ALL of the waiters and waitresses were extremely friendly throughout the evening -- to us and to other parties. The menu was pretty daunting as there were many seafood and Italian dishes to choose from, so we did our research on the more popular dishes way before we walked in. Based on our research, and the flavors our tastebuds love, we went with the following:\n\nNew England Clam Chowder (Bowl)\n- Hearty and very tasty. There was a fair amount of potatoes and clams inside. Since it was cold outside, the warm chowder really hit the spot. On the bad side, there were a few sandy spots in the chowder, but not enough to really bother us that much.\n\nBaked Clams (Cherry Stones)\n- Another winner. Unfortunately, there were only 10 clams in the order because we could have easily just kept on going and going and going. The clams were big and baked really well. The breading used on the clams were very flavorful, especially when the squeezed lemon was sprinkled onto it.\n\nFried Calamari (with sauce on top)\n- This is the dish many come here for and it did not disappoint. The red sauce was so tasty and just right. It wasn't too thick and wasn't too liquidity either. The calamari was easy to chew thru and fried well. The batter on the calamari maybe could have used a little bit more crunch, but the sauce really softened it up quickly, so the crunchiness of them wouldn't last long.\n\nShrimp Fra Diavolo (On A Bed Of Pasta shrimp, clams & mussels in a red spicy sauce)\n- Probably our least favorite dish, but that probably has more to do with our preferences. We decided to order this since we saw so many pictures of it. Unfortunately, the sauce was a bit more watery than we liked and we weren't big fans of the entire dish because it was basically just linguine with red sauce and seafood. With that said, it still wasn't that bad and pretty flavorful. I'm more of a chicken parm pasta dish kind of guy, so this was far from my 1st choice, but we went with it anyway to share.\n\nOverall, we really couldn't complain. The restaurant wasn't crowded on the night we went and the food was good. Like I said earlier, the service was also excellent and the folks working there couldn't be more friendly. Are there a few things they could fix? Sure ... but it wasn't the end of the world and none of the negative things ruined our meal.\n\nFYI - For you T-shirt collectors, they sell T-shirts advertising the restaurant.","review_date":"16/1/2018","category":"Food & Beverage"}

Squeezed lemon juice\n4. An oyster cracker for the clams, two oyster crackers for the oyster.\nThere's a bit too much meat on the cherry stones for my liking: still delicious, but your chew is mostly clam rather than an amalgam of clam with accoutrements.\n\nShrimp Cocktail: A\nBeautiful, humongous, soft, tasty shrimp.  Phenomenal cocktail sauce.  The best.\n\nLobster Fra Diavolo: A+\nI've had an awful lot of Fra Diavolo in my life, and this is one of the best.  The secret?  Their sauce.  It's tremendous!  I'd say medium to light on the heat index.  If you're ok with semi-spicy food, you can order this and let them use their default spice level.  Pro-Tip: They create the sauce from scratch when you order the dish.  If you like sauces, I would order this dish \"with extra, extra sauce\" to make sure you get enough sauce.  Seriously, it's stupid good.\n\nMarinated Burned Chicken: C\nSauce is very good; it tastes like a butter and wine sauce (I was expecting marinara so this was a surprise and I ended up liking it).  However, the chicken was unforgivably dry.  Some pieces were OK, but the majority of it had to be choked down with water.  I'm not sure whether it was overcooked at the outset or simply warmed in a microwave for too long, but either way, this dish is no bueno.  No amount of sauce would've helped this dish.\n\nStuffed Filet: A+\nThis is flounder stuffed with crab meat and tiny shrimp.

It's his first time here. I ordered my dad's favorite dishes, fried calamari with marinara sauce, half a dozen of cherry stone clams, shrimp scampi, and clam chowder. The taste of the food and the restaurant settings made me feel that my dad was still sitting next to me. It was as good as how I remember it. \n\nI'll be moving away again.

While I should have taken a picture of my dinner last night, I simply didn't feel like it but rest assured there are plenty of pictures already uploaded on here of the dish I got that are very accurate. \n\nI was seriously craving a stuffed lobster from Lobster House Joes on Staten Island but was not in the mood to travel all the way over there and back so I literally searched all of Ubereats to try and find something similar. I got tired of searching and was going to order something from Anthony's in sheepshead bay but something told me to just type in Stuffed Lobster in the search bar and this place popped up. That's when I came here and saw pics of the dish and decided to go ahead and order, it looked very very similar to Joe's just a tad more expensive. \n\nI called and asked them if it was possible to switch out the side options for some simple pasta and oil w/ garlic but apparently that wasn't allowed even if I paid extra? Idk I thought that was stupid, I'm paying almost $50 for a plate of lobster, why would I want French fries or fried zucchini? This forced me to get an extra side order of pasta which cost me $11. I was pretty annoyed lol, it was a small aluminum container of spaghetti and marinara, that's it that's all for $11. The lobster arrived in an aluminum tray and could have easily fed 2 people. The stuffing was good but nothing amazing tbh, there were more shrimp and breadcrumbs than anything else, barely any crab or lobster and a slight hint of cheese, so was it better than Joes? No definitely not. BUT, the lobster was good and I still have some stuffing left. I would definitely order again, I just most likely wouldn't get this dish cause it doesn't compare to what I'm used to. Maybe I'll go for something grilled next time.","review_date":"12/6/2021","category":"Food & Beverage"}

I am writing this review after my second visit to provide a more well rounded feedback.\n\nNow that the restaurant has been around for a while, the walk-in experience is a lot more manageable in case a reservation wasn't secured ahead. There are also bar seatings for any small parties.\n\nWe have tried a variety of dishes and our favorites consist of pork xiao long bao (budget about 1 serving for two people), spicy wontons, sticky rice shao mai, Taiwanese cabbage, and minced pork noodle.  Though the xiao long bao quality wasn't consistent between both visits where the most recent one felt a bit dry. \n\nServices were friendly overall, but not timely. We had to remind different servers on getting a lid for the hot tea, which never arrived. It was also a bit confusing on which server would remove the empty plate vs just delivering dishes. The server from our first visit checked on us a few times during the meal while the server from our second visit only came by once to see if we needed to order desserts.\n\nLastly, we asked for extra ginger during the 2nd visit, but the server never mentioned the extra $3 charge.

We had the sesame espresso martini and the yuzu margarita.  The sesame espresso martini was the best espresso martini I have ever had and the yuzu margarita was also nice and refreshing.\n\nDessert was really a bit disappointing to us as well.  Having had their chocolate xiao long bao and their sesame dumplings in the past at other locations, these were 10x the sweetness of their Asian locations.  the chocolate xiao long bao was made with a super sweet milk chocolate instead of dark chocolate and their sesame dumplings had so much sugar that we did not finish either dish.\n\nService was meh - and the ambiance was an upscale homage to the Din Tai Fung mothership.\n\nWhile I continue to be a Din fan, I don't see myself returning to the NY location any time soon.","review_date":"2/8/2025","category":"Food & Beverage"}

{"company_name":"Din Tai Fung","stars":"4","text":"This was my second time having Din Tai Fung - my first was in Hong Kong. I had thought the soup dumplings were way too small and alright but nothing special during my first visit. Fast forward a couple of years later, I still think that about Din Tai Fung's soup dumplings. But now that my tastebuds are slightly more refined compared to back then, I would also like to say that their pork dumpling filling tastes very clean and healthy. There's not a lot of fat in the meat, the meat tastes like it's of high quality, and without an overwhelming amount of seasoning. 4/5\n\nTheir spicy chicken wonton fillings were also similar in that way. The size of the wontons were small, too. I thought the sauce could be spicier (like hot chili oil type of spicy). 3/5\n\nThe cucumber salad has a lot of copycat recipes online, so I thought I'd try the real thing. Though unassuming, the cucumber salad is actually really addicting. The freshness and crunch of each cucumber just had me going back for more. I ended up making them at home after with a copycat recipe, and I would have to say they're pretty easy to make! 5/5\n\nNoodles with sesame sauce (with crushed peanuts and chili oil). I feel like this was a waste of money - literally just noodles with sauce,. I wasn't particularly fond of the sesame sauce. It was on the blander side even though it supposedly had chili oil. 2/5\n\nFried rice with fried pork chop - The rice itself was alright but a little on the blander side. At least you can see the individuality of each grain of rice. It tastes better with a bit of chili oil. I really liked the fried pork chop. I was expecting something katsu-style, but there's no breading (so it appears). It still had a nice crispy crust (not katsu level, of course), and was well seasoned. The meat tasted clean with no fats and was a good amount of tender. 4/5\n\nChocolate and mochi xiao long bao - I see chocolate xlb online a lot, so I've been really wanting to try it! I honestly didn't know what to expect, as I couldn't imagine chocolate in a xlb. But it was one of my favorite dishes here! The chocolate isn't overwhelmingly sweet. I couldn't tell the difference regarding the mochi and regular dumpling skin. I got a side of sea salt cream (extra $1) to go with it, and I think it was a nice touch. Couldn't really taste the cream, but it added to the texture. 5/5\n\nThis place is reservations only. They give you a 15-minute grace period if you're late, but honestly, I think you have a bit longer than that. Because after I entered, I still had to wait in a medium-sized line to check in for my reservation. Once checked in, they give you a buzzer, so you still have to wait a bit before you actually get seated. I probably waited less than 10 minutes? \n\nThe restaurant has a really nice ambiance and definitely is going for the elevated route. There are a lot of tables inside, so many different parties at once. Each area on the floor is sectioned off and assigned to multiple waiters. But despite the crowd size, I never once felt neglected by my waiter, who was very prompt and gave us food suggestions.","review_date":"20/6/2025","category":"Food & Beverage"}

They suggest 2 items per person is the rule of thumb. We had the frieporkchop fried rice; chicken dumplings; cucumber dish; wonton in their infamous sauce. The cucumber dishes pairs best if you dont eat right away, use it as a palette cleanser throughout the meal. The chicken dumplings were superb probably my favorite out of all the savory dishes. The rest lacked a bit of salt but still good.\n\nPlease don't skip the chocolate & mochi dumplings with salted cream. It was a pleasant surprise.

Upon entering the restaurant, you can immediately feel the luxurious and dim atmosphere, making it a moody environment for a great dinner experience. Expect a wait considering this restaurant's popularity, but there is plenty of seating in the waiting area and I would recommend making a reservation ahead of time. As a dim sum restaurant, you order using a sheet and numbering the amount of items you want to order from the menu.\n\nThe Kurobata Pork Xiao Long Bao were delicious and soft, and the Shrimp & Kurobuta Pork Pot Stickers were crispy and filling. The cucumber salad was quite refreshing and flavorful with the chili oil, and the string beans with garlic are a classic vegetable side. Additionally, the chicken wonton soup was hearty and delicious, and the soup itself was light yet savory. The most unique item I tried was the Chocolate & Mochi Xiao Long Bao, definitely worth the try if you are a chocolate fan!

{"company_name":"Din Tai Fung","stars":"3","text":"I really wanted to like this place and was really looking forward to this reservation since we had booked this 2 weeks in advance. Reservations are required and it's hard to get for a peak mealtime unless you book a weeknight in advance.\nI felt like everyone else had gone to check it out already and that we were late to the game; there is so much hype to the brand name. Unfortunately the place did not live up to their reputation.\n\nWe went on a weeknight at 6pm. When you walk in, the ambiance walking down the staircase is stunning. There is a little metal sculpture of a soup dumpling at the bottom of the staircase for photos ops. Then you check in and they give you a pager for when your table is ready. \n\nAs you are seated, you pass by the glass wall where you can see the chefs preparing the xiao long bao (soup dumplings), which is pretty cool. The entire restaurant is lit by very pretty lanterns and you feel a sense of relaxation with the wooden / black decor. \n\nThe food came very quickly. However this is where I felt let down. I felt that the xiao long bao were actually just average. The cucumber salad was honestly a standout, more so than the actual bao. We also enjoyed the cocktails - the sesame espresso martini (nyc exclusive) and the pear martini. \n\nUnfortunately, the soup dumplings have paper thin skins and lack flavor, even in the truffle soup dumplings which we were warned to have a strong flavor. The chili oil was delicious but I found I had to douse every dumpling in it. We did enjoy the cod dumplings which were surprisingly soupy and full of flavor, more than the xiao long bao.\n\nMy boyfriend and I both left the restaurant hungry.\n\nAlso subtracting a star due to the price point of the dishes. Very expensive - be prepared for a check somewhere in the ballpark of $100-$200 for a table of 2. The service was very good and there was no trouble finding a waiter when we needed.\n\nOverall I might come back if the occasion comes up but I do think that this brand name is overrated; it is a decent soup dumpling place with classy decor and expensive dishes. Personally, I would prefer a less flashy, more down to earth restaurant for soup dumplings for a much more reasonable price. We both prefer Nan Xiang over Din Tai Fung. \n\nThe only really \"worth-it\" points about this place are the ambiance and this high-society, exclusive feeling of eating at a fancy reservation-only spot. \n\nUpdate: originally I rated 4/5 but we both ate more later tonight and felt disappointed in the value. Minus another star. Resulting in a 3/5 rating. Not worth the price tag!","review_date":"20/5/2025","category":"Food & Beverage"}

My son has been to the one in Taiwan, my best friend has been to San Jose & Las Vegas and I have been to San Jose & NYC. When we compare notes it stands out that the focus is on consistency and perfection.  We all have been a fan of the seaweed salad, but the soup dumplings are the star of the show. I found the dumplings in NYC to be a little bit thicker than the ones in CA. The decor of the dining room in NYC is wonderful and one of the largest seating areas in the city. (For those of you that were here in the late 1990's this was the location of MARS 2112 an amazing tourist themed space dining experience. Step into a UFO and you were immediately transported to Mars.) I enjoy the open kitchen where you can see the dumplings being hand made. All locations are very popular. You will need a reservation or at least be on the waitlist. If you are alone and the restaurant is not over crowded sitting at the bar is always an option. We went at lunch time and were seated immediately. The hostess and the server were very friendly and we were given a complimentary tea at the end of our meal. I was very satisfied with the entire experience. I did note that of the different locations the NYC restaurant has little more cooperate clientele even though it is located at the fringe of Times Square.

XLB did not have enough soup inside the dumplings, which was a bit disappointing.  \n\nI personally think plain pork ones are better than the crab and pork but others at the table liked the crab and pork ones better.  Dumplings in chili oil was excellent.  Would recommend this item along with XLB.  We also tried sesame noodles, dan dan noodles, and Shanghai rice cakes.  All were okay but stick with dumplings.\n\nFor other dishes, we tried cucumbers, woodear mushrooms, sautÃ©ed green beans, and wok choi.  They all paired very well with the dumplings and so I would recommend.\n\nFinally, service was efficient and they paced the food for us so that we didn't just get all our order at our table at once.\n\nI would recommend, especially if you are into nice modern dining decor to go along with your dumplings.","review_date":"24/6/2025","category":"Food & Beverage"}
{"company_name":"Din Tai Fung","stars":"4","text":"I came here for lunch last Thursday with my team- there were 10 of us in total. I'm the only Asian in the group and I actually grew up in Taiwan, so I was really excited to introduce everyone to Din Tai Fung. Thankfully, the food and vibe totally lived up to the hype! \nEveryone loved it, and a few coworkers even said they want to bring our business partners here next time.\n\nThat said, the reservation system was a bit of a headache. They only accept online reservation , but you can only book for up to 6 people online. If you have more than 6 people , you're forced to make two separate reservations--but here's the catch: the system won't let you do that using the same name, phone number, email, or even credit card. It flags it and rejects the second booking, which was super frustrating.\n\nI emailed their booking team to ask how to reserve for 10 people, and they basically sent a standard response suggesting we book a private room... for $1,400. And that doesn't include food or drinks. I get it--it's Midtown NYC--but honestly, who's paying $1,400 just for a room for lunch?\n\nIn the end, we managed to make it work, and we really enjoyed the food and service. It's a great spot and I'd totally recommend it--but I really hope they update their reservation system to make it easier for larger groups.","review_date":"16/6/2025","category":"Food & Beverage"}
{"company_name":"Din Tai Fung","stars":"4","text":"I finally made my way to Din Tai Fung, and while some dishes lived up to the hype, others left me wanting more. Here's my breakdown for one of  the hardest restaurant to get into:\n\nChicken Soup Dumplings - 4/10\nThese were disappointing. Tiny, with barely any soup inside. If you're craving real soup dumplings, I'd recommend hitting up a hole-in-the-wall spot in Chinatown or Flushing instead.\n\nSpicy Pork Wontons - 8/10\nPleasantly surprised! I've had better, but these were still solid. I went in with sky-high expectations thanks to social media, but while they weren't a perfect 10, they were definitely worth ordering.\n\nSpicy Noodles - 8/10\nA simple but tasty dish. Not very spicy on its own, but pro tip: save the sauce from the spicy pork wontons and mix it in--it takes the noodles to another level. Also, if you like a real kick, mention your spice preference when ordering.\n\nGarlic String Beans - 10/10\nEasily the best side dish on the table. Perfectly cooked, crunchy, and loaded with flavor without being overly garlicky. I'd come back just for these.\n\nSpicy Cucumbers - 9/10\nA great balance of spicy and sweet. I make these at home often, and while these weren't mind-blowing, they were definitely a refreshing and shareable starter.\n\nChocolate Xiao Long Bao - 10/10\nThe absolute star of the meal! Warm, gooey dark chocolate inside a soft bun--it was pure indulgence. I don't even love dark chocolate, but this wasn't bitter at all. Pro tip: Add the sea salt cream for $3. It's worth every penny.\n\nHoney Lemonade - 10/10\nLight, refreshing, and even better with boba. A great way to balance out all the bold flavors.\n\nWould I go back? Yes! But next time, I'm going for the fried rice and baby back ribs--I saw them pass by, and my mouth was watering.\n\nOverall, a good experience, the waitstaff and hostess was sweet and very attentive. But if you're a hardcore soup dumpling fan, you might want to set your expectations accordingly.","review_date":"21/3/2025","category":"Food & Beverage"}

This is my honest review and what we ordered. We ordered Crab Xiao Long Bao, regular pork xiao long bao(XLB), string beans with garlic, and sweet and sour baby back pork ribs, dessert: chocolate mochi XLB with sea salt cream.\n\nThe baby back pork ribs were pretty tasty. They were tender and had a slightly smoky taste which is well incorporated. (4/5)\n\nThe string beans with garlic were done perfectly. Exactly the right texture (from blanching) and then stir-frying. (5/5)\n\nFinally, the xiao long bao. Overall, they were.......underwhelming. Both crab and regular tasted a bit bland with little seasoning/marination for the filling. The only redeeming factor was the thin yet plyable dumpling skin. They nailed the dumpling skin almost perfectly in any ideal XLB. However, the XLB, as a whole, pales in comparison to shanghainese style XLB (Din Tai Fung is a Taiwanese-influenced version). The flavor is not there. The soup is not there (literally not there, 5ml per dumpling). \nCrab (3/5), Regular (2/5)\n\nDessert: (2.5/5) chocolate filling XLB. Tastes exactly how it looks and sounds nothing special or great.\n\nOverall, it was kind of disappointing. I can definitely say, this is not even close to the \"best soup dumplings in the world\". I would rank this somewhere in the middle. The filling fell flat and sad, no love, no soul, just a wasted piece of pork (basically boiled with some salt).

Tokyo stole my heart first, then San Diego kept the spark alive, and now--hello, New York.\n\nOn a recent quick trip to the city with my friend Alex, I had just one day, one Broadway show, and one mission: get to Din Tai Fung at all costs. I made a reservation for 1:15 PM like the responsible adult I pretend to be, but then the day unraveled faster than a Chinatown knockoff purse. We missed the 15-minute grace window, and I thought the dumpling dream was over.\n\nBut never underestimate my determination (or my pleading skills). After our show, we sprinted to Din Tai Fung's new location inside the Shops at Columbus Circle. Yes, it's their first East Coast spot, and it's massive. When we arrived, I went straight to the host stand and met Haya, who instantly restored my faith in humanity. I explained our tragic missed reservation, and she smiled like someone who's seen it all. She popped us on the waitlist and directed us to the bar. Each interaction with her was wonderful.  She easily made conversation and genuinely looked like she enjoys her job .\n\nAt the bar, I ordered my go-to: the Pear Lychee Martini. It's sweet, refreshing, and sneaky--exactly how I like my drinks. One drink in and boom, our table was ready. Just like that. Dumpling destiny, baby.\n\nNaturally, I wasted no time and ordered two baskets of the Kurobuta Pork Xiao Long Bao. These little soup bombs never miss. The wrapper is thin and delicate, the broth is flavorful, and the temperature is perfectly ready-to-eat (no lip-scorching here). I don't know how they do it, but I don't ask questions. I just eat.\n\nNow, let's talk about the Great Soup Dumpling Debate. Alex followed the \"proper\" technique: place the dumpling on a spoon, poke it open, sip the soup, then bite. I, on the other hand, am more of a thrill-seeker. I pop the whole thing in my mouth like I'm defusing a delicious bomb. We agreed to disagree and ordered another round.\n\nFinal thoughts: Din Tai Fung is now officially a non-negotiable part of my NYC (and California) routine.

The restaurant is that popular that the space would easily be scooped up by other patrons if there was a no-show. Thankfully we were all there on-time and the staff was prompt in seating us. It was very interesting walking to our take and watching the glass-window room where all the magic of making the dumplings happens. Everything was on point- the food, the service, and the setting especially our nice semi-private section that had large tv monitors looked like it could be used to hold meetings or convert to a karaoke room. While the soup dumplings were not the best I've ever had, they were freshly made in-house and still juicy and very good. The noodles with sesame sauce and the pork chop fried rice were the winners, favorites of the entire meal. Overall, a positive experience and a must try.","review_date":"20/7/2025","category":"Food & Beverage"}

So be warned, if you want to dine here (and you would be crazy to miss this place) you need to plan ahead and book reservations. \n\nIt is a little easier to book bar seating but the tables are more relaxing.

{"company_name":"Din Tai Fung","stars":"3","text":"I got here five minutes early to my reservation and was handed a disk to wait for my table. I guess it makes sense because it would be easier to buzz the disk instead of yelling out someone's name but part of me felt annoyed because there was only one other party waiting and they seated them and a party that came in after me, first. Already I was feeling annoyed.... If there isn't a lot of folks waiting, I thought the disk was excessive, unnecessary, and in my part, delayed me getting my table because it looked like a tech issue.\n\nWhen we were seated, I asked for still water, which comes in a bottle and they gave me tap. Ok... fine, slightly annoyed but I wasn't going to lose my mind over it. Then when they were serving us our food, one of the servers passing by almost knocked over our large bottle of water and my friend got splashed. When they cleared our table for dessert, they didn't replace our spoons for the chocolate XLB, so we had to eat the little buns whole, or spill the chocolate on our plates, which you can see happened to me. Because of that, I wasn't fully able to enjoy my dessert or finish the sea salt foam (like how do you expect me to enjoy foam with chopsticks). Yes - I could have asked for spoons, but this entire experience made me feel like our service was not attentive at all, literally throwing the food at us. \n\nAbysmal service aside, food was also largely unimpressive. I've been to two Ding Tai Fengs in China and Taiwan, and felt like the quality was not as good in comparison. The XLB were WAY smaller and there was not enough soup in the dumpling, nor did they taste fresh. I was prepared for the soup to burn my tongue, but when I bit into it, it was at room temp, like they've been sitting for a while. The spicy wontons and noodles kind of just tasted the same to me, and was nothing to rave about. The cucumber salad is also massively overhyped-- there are better and larger cucumber salads at local Northern Chinese restaurants. Disappointing. \n\nThe only saving grace of this depressing experience was the chocolate XLB. I love chocolate and having this literally added a star to my review. I was going to leave two stars, but the chocolate XLB was just that awesome. \n\n100% will probably never come back, unless I could just sit at the bar and have the chocolate XLB.","review_date":"26/2/2025","category":"Food & Beverage"}

{"company_name":"Din Tai Fung","stars":"4","text":"Compared to all the soup dumplings and Taiwanese street food dishes in NYC, Din Tai Fung stands out as the best. The flavors are quite close to authentic Taiwanese cuisine, bringing a sense of nostalgia for those familiar with the taste.\n\nThat said, it's not the same as Din Tai Fung in Taipei. The soup dumpling wrappers, as well as those for wontons and other dumplings, are noticeably thicker and less delicate than Din Tai Fung in Taiwan and Japan. The signature 18 folds on the soup dumplings are not consistent, and the tops are too thick. Watching the chefs in the open kitchen, it's clear that their technique doesn't match the skill level seen in Taiwan.\n\nAmong all the dishes we tried, the standout was the sweet and sour baby ribs, which had an authentic flavor and texture. The beef noodle soup was surprisingly good, and the sesame noodles were quite close to the Taiwanese style. While it's understandable that exact replication in a foreign setting is difficult--and the flavors may have been adjusted to suit American preferences--we're just happy to have a place where we can enjoy these familiar street food flavors.","review_date":"21/2/2025","category":"Food & Beverage"}

We had a 2:15 reservation and checked in but still had to wait another 15 minutes. Not ideal. \n\nOnce we sat, we ordered by checking off the items on the menu sheet. We ordered the pork soup dumplings, cucumber, hot and sour soup, potstickers, beef tenderloin, garlic string beans, spicy wontons, pork chop fried rice, and chocolate dumplings. \n\nThe food was quite good. The soup dumplings aren't as good as I remembered them. The first batch lacked soup. The second batch was much better but still not my favorite. \n\nThe highlights were the string beans, the wontons, hot and sour soup, beef tenderloin, and chocolate dumplings. The main issue with the food here is that it's served almost like it's coursed out when Chinese food should be eaten all together. So basically we were eating string beans by itself, then the fried rice by itself, and then the beef by itself.

The soup dumplings were incredibly small, the smallest I've ever seen at a restaurant (even trader joes box soup dumplings are bigger) but sure at least they give you 10 dumplings in an order. The flavor was relatively bland and there was no depth at all. There was also no sauce so I ate my soup dumplings dry. The rice cakes were ok but also not the best I've had.

The shrimp crackers are nice and light. The chili sauce is not spicy but very strong in umami flavor.\n\nPho Ha Noi\nI really enjoyed the pho here. The flavors just seemed to click for me. The broth was nice and hearty. The bird eye chilis were a perfect way to add spice. The pickled garlic added a new flavor profile.\n\nWagyu Pho\nThis pho was special in that the server will pour out the broth during serving (as opposed to a normal pho like the Pho Ha Noi). This was my girlfriend's dish and aside from the presentation, she didn't really feel that this pho was that much different from the Pho Ha Noi. \n\nPork Banh mi\nDecided to order this instead of an appetizer since I heard about dipping the banh mi into the provided soup. The banh mi itself is a decent size, and while not the best banh mi I've ever had, it feels like a different dish with the dip soup.

But overall I still greatly enjoyed it. I think one might need to not picture it or compare it to Houston or viet pho. Overall still a very great bowl of noodles. Slightly pricey though so def something one can try once.\n\nFor lunch special on a weekday, I thought it was priced well. What I also liked was I was able to had an appetizer add on. Normally you would have to order a whole appetizer and would require a few more people in a group to try more of the items. But for a fraction of the price I can simple get a taste of what apps they offer which I really appreciate. So def take advantage of the weekday lunch specials and ordering the add ons. The pho ga was good, def good chicken and very standard and good pho ga. Zero complaints. I personally really liked the dry pho. My only complaint is that it was too big and too much beef? (If that is even a complaint). After a salad or a soup, I really couldn't finish the dry pho. It may look rather small but when eating it felt pretty hefty. It's more like a Lo mein so it isn't completely dry. But I really liked the soy sauce mixture.\n\nSo overall def recommend la dong, just don't expect it to be like your average viet spot.

We had a 6:00pm reservation, but two of us ended up being a bit late. They were still able to sit us, but warned that they would start the 1.5 hour dining time at the point they sat us, regardless of when our last person arrived. This was fine with us, as we were the ones who were late. \n\nWe ended up splitting everything, so here's a giant list of all the food that we ordered for 4 people: \n- Steamed Rice Cakes with shrimp, dried shrimp, scallion oil, shallot, garlic & Vietnamese dipping sauce\n- Nem NÆ°á»›ng, or grilled meatballs, served in red leaf lettuce wrap,\nCara Cara orange, ginger, cucumber, toasted coconut, shallot & peanut sauce\n- PÃ¢tÃ© & Bone: chicken liver mousse, pickle, bone marrow & toasted baguette\n- Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio with *rare* American wagyu slices, fresh lime, shrimp paste, watercress, Vietnamese coriander, peanut, crispy shallots & bird's eye chili\n- CÃ¡ ChiÃªn NÆ°á»›c Máº¯m: fried whole Branzino (de-boned) tossed in sweet fish sauce glaze, fresh greens & herbs\n- Shaking Beef: wok tossed American Wagyu cubes, onion, yellow pepper in garlic soy (served medium-rare) & watercress-cilantro salad\n- CÃ  Ri SÆ°á»n BÃ², or beef short rib curry: tender braised short ribs in Vietnamese yellow curry, baby carrot & coconut milk\nserved with baguette. creamy, spicy & fragrant\n- Classic Banh Mi with homemade pork sausage, ground pork spread, chicken pÃ¢tÃ©, fresh herbs, pickle & Vietnamese mayo\n\nOk, perhaps our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. But it was so good. \n\nMy favorites out of the appetizers were the Steamed Rice Cakes and the Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio. The beef carpaccio was super fresh and I loved the mixture of sauce that was layered on top of the carpaccio. It gave the beef such a fresh, crisp flavor. Out of the entrees, I would say the banh mi and the beef short rib curry were my favorites. I'm a sucker for a good coconut milk curry and this one did not disappoint. It was so flagrant and flavorful. \n\nService was great and our waitress was super friendly. \n\nAnd perhaps this is more my fault than anything, for not asking, because you always have to ask for the price when it comes to specials. But I did order our waitress's recommendation for a drink and it ended up being $43 for essentially a penicillin with special whiskey.

I didn't think they added anything to the bone marrow, but they didn't need to anyway because it was already so fatty, gelatinous, rich, and dreamy on its own, I'm still salivating thinking of it.

I came here on a Friday night with my boyfriend at around 5:30 and was able to be seated immediately! Here's what we ordered: \n\nPho Ha Noi: (3.5/5) Although the broth was pretty flavorful and fragrant, the addition of the crispy onions became overpowering, making it taste almost like a French onion soup. Definitely not my favorite bowl of pho in NYC; however, it was still delicious! \n\nPork Banh Mi: (3.5/5) The fact that every banh mi is accompanied by a side of truffle pho for dipping is INCREDIBLE. I wish every restaurant did this!! However, although the idea is amazing, the execution fell a bit flat. The pork itself felt dry and lacking in charred flavor despite the abundance of grill marks on the meat itself. Additionally, the truffle pho broth felt very one-dimensional and overly salty. \n\nOverall, our meal at La Dong felt just okay.

{"company_name":"La Dong","stars":"5","text":"This is currently my favourite restaurant of this year. Yes this place is fusion, yes it is elevated Vietnamese food, and yes it is more expensive than your typical Vietnamese restaurant, but it executes with skill so that each component is thoughtfully prepared with precision, ensuring that flavors are balanced and textures perfected - at least that's the case for my Bun Bo Hue dish. We usually go for hole in the wall, unassuming Vietnamese restaurants bc those usually have the best flavours, but at La Dong not only is the food delicious, but the dÃ©cor is just absolutely gorgeous and such a vibe. \n\nI've been ordering Bun Bo Hue at all the restaurants that serve it, even at the Vietnamese restaurants in Philly and if you love Vietnamese food you know Philly is supposed to have amazing Vietnamese restaurants, but nothing has really hit the mark for this specific dish except for La Dong. The soup was flavourful, the meat was fresh and tender, and the noodles were cooked to the perfect texture. Every component of this dish was done perfectly here, while at other restaurants either the noodle texture wasn't great, or the pork hock wasn't tender enough, flavoured enough, or fresh enough...etc. \n\nThe two sides that we tried were the morning glory and the crispy fried tofu scallion - we loved both and would recommend both. The tofu was velvety soft on the inside - I loved the texture and I also loved the flavour. \n\nI'm seeing a lot of reviews saying the pho was not very good, I feel like part of the negative response is probably due to the price point, however I personally have not tried the soup pho so I can't say. I did try a bit of the dry pho and it's a creative take on pho for those not feeling for hot soup. I liked the flavouring even though it is on the saltier side. The sauce used in it centers around the oyster dipping sauce that is served at all traditional pho restaurants. \n\nI really enjoyed this place.

{"company_name":"La Dong","stars":"5","text":"I dined at La Dong with two friends. One lives nearby. He recommended it based on having walked by many a time. He had a flight the next day, and, as a nervous traveler, he didn't wish to be out too far from home. The other two of us had to travel to the venue. I can say it was not a trip I regretted. (I actually took a rental bike there from a prior appointment. That was exhilarating and generated an appetite.)\nThis establishment exemplifies a new trend of Asian restaurants moving upmarket. Scholars have studied the price points and popular perceptions of different ethnic cuisines. Some such as French, or an outlier among Asian offerings, Japanese, can command premiums with the public, while others such as Chinese and likely Vietnamese have been historically associated with more affordable niches. As much as the change is to be welcomed for the symbolism as to respect for the communities from which the food originated, it also means that the diner will be charged more. In this instance, however, the menu listings were not outrageous, and, more importantly, were worth the charge. The ambiance suggests fancier. The service, likewise. \nWe shared two starters. One was the pate and bone marrow. The other was the morning glory. Each was flavorful in its own manner. The former was generous compared to the same item elsewhere. The latter was fresh and well seasoned, a necessary green to accompany the otherwise heavier entrees.\nOur party had, respectively, a classic banh mi, a beef main course, and mussels in the appetizer size. Everyone enjoyed their choice. The banh mi was enough for leftovers. The beef looked great. The mussels were the smaller species, in a southeast Asian inflected broth. For dessert, despite my own interest in sampling the avocado ice cream, we settled on a more plain vanilla, albeit accompanied by either giant boba or whatever the proper term is for such tapioca, and a cookie that had subtle complex spices in the mixture. \nWe were leisurely. Nobody rushed us. The tab was reasonable. Everyone surrounding us seemed to be similarly enjoying a night out on the town. I am accordingly pleased to commend the establishment. It would be well suited to a first date or a larger gathering. Kudos to the proprietors. They have struck the best balance.","review_date":"7/3/2025","category":"Food & Beverage"}

The summer rolls held together perfectly in the usual rice paper wrap. The veggies were fresh and the shrimp was well cooked. Overall, what you would expect at a Vietnamese restaurant but double the price. The crispy spring rolls were excellent. They are wrapped in a net wrap, which is so much better IMO than the regular wrap. The filling was delicious, but nothing special. Lastly, for appetizers, we got the bone marrow. What a decadent dish. The fat from the bone marrow with a lob of pate work perfectly over a well toasted baguette. \nNow for the mains. The broth for the pho is incredible. I drank it up, which I probably shouldn't have - I assume it goes way over the daily recommended salt consumption. We got the pho with the wagyu. Super tender beef. Does not come with the usual Hoisin and sriracha sauce, but you don't need it. I kind of also miss the other accompaniments - beef balls, tendon, tripe. Overall, the quality of the noodles and broth were excellent.\nNext came the duck tamarind. The sauce was so savory - I poured it over a bed of rice and went to town with it.\nWe got a grilled branzino, which came with lettuce and rice noodle - we wrapped it all together in the lettuce and dipped it in a citrus spiced sauce; flavors all worked incredibly well.

{"company_name":"La Dong","stars":"4","text":"I was here at this unique Vietnamese restaurant earlier in the day with a group of six others. The food here is Vietnamese but elevated so don't exactly expect as traditional grub and the prices are slightly because of this and also because of the nice space. They have two sides of the menu including chef specialties and more traditional dishes though it's hard to say one side was that traditional when there is a $35 pho (nope.) Speaking of the nice space, the restaurant is honestly gorgeous and one of the better decorated restaurants from the mural in front to the paper lanterns above our seat which unfortunately had some red lighting so many of my photos came out a bit poorly. The staff here was pretty friendly but faulty as they forgot to bring out serving spoons occasionally and they brought out food extremely quickly especially for the main dishes which is very reminiscent of their other restaurant Pranakhon and Thai Villa. \n\nI started with a Calamansi Matcha Spritz which was very much calamansi forward with barely a hint of matcha but it was refreshing and worked throughout the meal and was only $7. I probably would instead get a hot Vietnamese coffee/cÃ  phÃª sá»¯a nÃ³ng next time instead of this or the iced version as it looked excellent on other tables. They gave us some crackers which had a dipping paste in the middle as a freebie to begin. The crackers were presumably tapioca only though they could have probably been shrimp/prawn crackers and had a good crunch while the dipping sauce was outstanding. It had some fish sauce flavor to it, a good amount of chili, and some sweetness but not too much so. It reminded me a little bit of a mixture of belacan and sambal or something equivalent and I honestly would buy a bottle from them as would one of the other people I ate dinner with.\n\nOur only appetizer was the Steamed Rice Cake/BÃ¡nh BÃ¨o with shrimp, dried shrimp, scallion oil, shallot, garlic & Vietnamese dipping sauce. They gave us some spoons to eat this with. The rice cakes had a slight coconut flavor to them and there was a little bit of plump shrimp. The dish came with four pieces and it was pretty worth it but I have preferred this from other spots.\n\nBest of the main dishes was definitely the Fried Whole Branzino/CÃ¡ ChiÃªn NÆ°á»›c Máº¯m listed as de-boned (branzino) tossed in sweet fish sauce glaze (with) fresh greens & herbs. The dish was presented nicely with the remaining skeleton of the fish on the platter with all of the pieces around the body of the fish with the herbs on the side. The fish was fried perfectly and they clearly got off almost all the fish that they could with only a tad bit of fish near the fin that could be munched on. The fish sauce had light sweetness and it was nice to make wraps with the fresh greens.\n\nThe Crab Fried Rice/CÆ¡m ChiÃªn Cua with white lump crab meat, scallion, egg, and jasmine rice was surprisingly good. I'm usually not someone who orders crab fried rice as I tend to find it most restaurants skimp on the crab but this place definitely did not. The rice was well seasoned and there was also a spicy green sauce on the side to add extra flavor. As someone who usually wouldn't recommend this dish, this is an excellent version here.\n\nThe Dry Pho Duck with egg noodle, crispy quarter duck, water spinach, shallot, scallion, cilantro, pickled ginger & duck essence gravy was also solid. The egg noodles were nice and the duck while small was crispy. This had a rich tasty sauce and the pickled ginger was a bit unexpected. I would recommend this as a meal for one.\n\nThe Duck Tamarind with crispy roasted half duck, tamarind and duck bone reduction, and steamed Ong Choy was pretty tasty. The tamarind sauce was thankfully not too sweet and the duck piece I had was tender. The ong choy/ water spinach was a good choice of vegetable and surprisingly there were a few slices of I believe pomelo on top also which was a fun touch. This was also a tasty duck dish and while I preferred the dry pho, this had more duck.\n\nThe Shaking Beef/BÃ² LÃºc Láº¯c listed as wok tossed American Wagyu cubes (served medium-rare,) with onion and yellow pepper in garlic soy with a watercress-cilantro salad was the weakest dish by a good amount. The meat was very tender but the sauce was a bit lighter than some other places. I have also preferred thicker chunks of meat from some other fancier Vietnamese spots such as the also recently opened Twin Tails in Columbus Circle as they added more texture and there could have been a lot more grilled onions also. \n\nThe flavors here are a tad light even for Vietnamese food but they have some creative fun options here. Particularly good fried branzino and crab fried rice and the duck dishes were not too shabby either. I would go back and likely get a bahn mi even if it pains me at that price point or try one of their other dishes. There's better spots but for fancy places, it is at least better than Madame Vo and the space is wonderful. Upper 3","review_date":"16/12/2024","category":"Food & Beverage"}

BÃ¡nh bÃ¨o is quite hard, not recommended at all. The sauce for bÃ¡nh Ä‘a is pretty good, like sweet and peanut-y; but there supposed to be pork floss in it but we didn 't taste anything.

The crab fried rice is phenomenal, the rice melts in your mouth, and the flavors do a number on your senses. Washed it all down with a Vietnamese iced coffee which was just the right amount of sweet. It had a malty texture, remarkably close to a bitter dark chocolate milkshake. The coconut ice cream is how coconut ice cream should be, all the time, everywhere. Topped with dry coconut shavings, jelly and a dehydrated banana leather, it was simple and elevated, all in one go.

I've had it twice and it was presented differently both times and tasted slightly different but both were amazing. This place feels very chef driven. Nam Khao Tod is A. hard to find because it's a laborious process to make and not very profitable since it's essentially rice. B. When you can find it, it's not always done well because restaurants will find shortcuts to make the cooking process faster. I'm talking about you Night + Market in LA.

I opted to sit at the counter facing the open kitchen (we love an open kitchen concept). \n\nI got the crab rangoon to start and then the krapow smash burger. The rangoons were tasty although there was v little crab and more cream cheese than anything else. I enjoyed the sweet chili sauce that came with it. The burger is what I really came for -- It honestly was one of the more flavorful burgers i've had in a while and that's obvi due to the thai flavors incorporated into the patty. The thai basil and chilies were a nice touch to the burger however I wish the sauce that came on there was a little more. Would I come back for the burger? Possibly.

Crispy rice salad was delicious as well. \n\nI was most looking forward to the pad Thai because it was so hyped on the website, but it wasn't my favorite. The noodle texture was a soft and sauced pad thai, but the other ingredients got lost in the noodles and sauce so you couldn't really taste or distinguish them. I felt there was only one wet/soft texture and one predominant flavor. If you're picking carbs, I'd suggest the crab fried rice instead -- we saw a lot being prepared and it looked good. \n\nThe sundae was tasty and different because of the sticky rice flavor and salted peanuts -- that gave it nice varying textures and tastes. However, it was not my personal favorite but it was very good. It was tough not comparing it to Thai Diner's coconut sundae (though they're different) because I recently had it. My companion loved it.\n\nLittle Grenjai's service was lovely and I'm eager to go back for the burger.","review_date":"10/11/2024","category":"Food & Beverage"}

The smashburger wasn't too greasy with the pickled veggies and we enjoyed the blend of pork and beef. It was missing a bit more sauce imo, could've been a creamier sauce since it wasn't too greasy.

I thought the burger was OK; I expected it to have a spicy kick and to be favorable but it was missing both of those things. I had them add the Thai fried egg on top, which was fine.

The location is small, very casual, lots of hipsters. I parked across the street on a Saturday afternoon. Walked in with my wife and 2yr old and stroller had to be parked in front. No problem, we sit at the booth my 2 yr is going crazy, touching everything, tapping people at the bar. Probably leave the baby at home. Anyways ordered the burger, made it a double and added the duck egg, got the pad thai with pork cracklin and drunken noodles. The pad thai was amazing, the portion was a little small in my opinion. The drunken noodles were spicy, not like Buffalo wings spicy like thai chillies spicy. If you enjoy spice this is such a great dish, full of flavor. Now the show stopper! The Burger! Wow, first bite you taste the marinated patty. It's strong flavors are well balanced with thai basil, their version of giardiniera and the unctuous egg that drips down the side of your mouth and the side of your hand. It was my favorite dish and have been thinking of is for the past 2 days. I can't wait to go back, will probably get the burger for sure and maybe try their different sides.

{"company_name":"Little Grenjai","stars":"4","text":"Welcome Little Grenjai to the neighborhood. The space is brightly lit with lots of daylight, with a modern retro interior, with diner style tables and seats. Staff is friendly but the layout is a little awkward due to the counter service ordering from the coffee bar instead of the front counter, so cramped lines form inbetween tables.\n\nTheir Krapow Smashburger is a fantastic take on a smashburger by adding a flair of thai flavors throughout. Chili infused beef patty, american cheese, pickled vegetables (incl. carrots, peppers, and cauliflower!), thai holy basil, and a shrimp-based sauce. This burger is unlike any other burger and tastes like it came right from the streets of Thailand.\n\nPeek Gai Tod fried chicken is good with a great blend of seasoning and marinade. The exterior was nice and crispy with the chicken still tender, albeit slightly oiley. The burgers came out first whereas I had to ask about the chicken since I wasn't sure if it was forgotten about or not. Strange to have the apps come after the mains but since they're brand new they're likely just trying to find the right pacing in the kitchen.\n\nKnock on the menu variety and pricing. The small yet wide variety of dishes seems like it would overwhelm the kitchen and some items are way overpriced (ie. congee is $14 with pork being a $4 add-on). They have a wide variety of beer and wine being served but no coffees or teas despite there being an espresso machine at the coffee bar?\n\nWould love to come back for dinner service or their monthly Tender Bits pop-up as it looks like an awesome experience.","review_date":"4/2/2024","category":"Food & Beverage"}
{"company_name":"Little Grenjai","stars":"3","text":"I had really high expectations for Grenjai after not only seeing tons of social posts about it, and also having a fellow Yelp Eliter recommend the burger to me. Sadly my experience fell flat.\n\nThe setup/layout is a bit interesting. You have to walk in between tables to the counter to place your order. It wasn't that busy when I was there, but i could see this being a bit awkward and cramped when it's busy.\n\nWhen I walked up to the counter the person there was texting or scrolling on their phone. I had to speak before being acknowledged. They quickly apologized and were friendly, as was the other person that brought our food. \n\nMy friend and I ended up ordering the wings, burger, fries, and the minced pork over rice.\n\n- Wings: Soggy. I wish they were still crispy. The sauce only partially coated a few of them and just felt like the flavors hadn't fully melded. I ended up having leftovers, which I airfried the next day and enjoyed a lot more.\n\n- Smash burger: one thing about a smashburger that I love, are those crispy bits that you get form the thin patty. This just didn't have that. Also, the flavor was just pretty flat. It just tasted... spicy. I was expecting more of a flavor explosion, but it just didn't happen. \n\n- Minced pork: It was really dry. My friend suggested we try it with some of the sauce that came with the wings, and we both found it more enjoyable. We saw others had ordered theirs with an egg, and had we known, we would have done the same. I think the egg would've made for a more memorable dish.\n\n- Fries: Despite having a sensitivity to potatoes, I had to try these lol. They were my favorite part of the meal! I love the cut of these fries--like wavy potato chips.\n\nI'm going to try them again soon for dinner.

All the noodles except Drunken Noodles have a fish sauce base and we were told it couldn't be made without it. So we got 2 out of the total 3 vegetarian things on the menu: brussel sprouts and drunken noodles with tofu puffs. However, they tried convincing us to get the cabbage instead of the brussels (was later wondering if this was bc the brussels or d noodles were also based in fish sauce and they didn't share that) and literally brought us that instead even after we very much declined and then said they accidentally wrote it down (?) Huh? But eventually got our order right. \nTheir tofu puffs, respectfully, are a waste of space. Felt like I was biting into air, had no flavor at all. The drunken noodles by themselves were good and the brussel sprouts were decent but after having delicious b-sprouts at another spot the night before this was an embarrassment for this place. Also, if you like your drunken noodles spicy, this isn't the spot for you. It had no spice, they just added peppers on the side. I would not return unless they upgraded their menu to be more vegetarian and vegan friendly and had better service but glad I tried this new spot by my apt so I can at least confirm it was a bad idea! It's always crowded for dinner but it was pretty empty for lunch which made sense after trying it.\n\nUPDATE- after reading Alex L.'s review below where they state they were told the Brussel sprouts were also based in fish sauce ... I'm in shock. BEYOND unprofessional and (quite frankly should be illegal?) of their staff to lie to us when we made it extremely clear we are vegetarian and wouldn't eat anything based in fish sauce.

I was prepared to eat the dish the way it is usually prepared but instead it came out separated.  I think this accounted for the dish tasting dry and a bit boring.

I decided to try the East Village location because I thought it would be bigger (it is not) and I really enjoy the udon. I went as a walk in for 2 around 8 and was told there was a 45 minute wait. We put our names down and went across the street to get a drink while we waited. The host texts us 4 minutes after we put our name down and it said we had 10 minutes to confirm so I confirmed but we didn't get back until 15-20 after we had confirmed since we needed to close out at the bar. It said our table was released but I decided to go up to the host anyways and let her know we got texted so we could try to get the next available table. Immediately she looks down at the iPad and makes a smirking face and proceeds to tell us what we did isn't allowed and she decided to do us a favor and give us an open table but if we're going to go somewhere else while we wait we have to be back in time. I understand they didn't need to save our table but she was pretty rude in the way she communicated it and could've been nicer. This hostess definitely left a bad impression since we didn't expect them to save the table even though they were 40 minutes off on the wait estimate, and she acted weirdly annoyed at us.\n\nDespite this, the rest of our experience was positive. Our server was extremely friendly and we got the Yuzu mimosa and agedashi tofu appetizer. The mimosa is exactly like what it sounds and super bubbly and refreshing with strong yuzu flavor. Agedashi tofu was delicious and the bonito flakes honestly tasted like a smokey fish jerky on top. The sauce was also great.\n\nI got the Gyunan udon which I expected to be a bit more meaty and savory in flavor but it was a more light and clean broth (still very good). Udon is chewy and wonderful texture. The gyunan was a bit lackluster overall since the meat was not very soft and I think it could've used some more fatty slices of beef and more beef in general. I tried the spicy Niku broth and it was amazing so a better option for something more hearty. \n\nMatcha tiramisu is my favorite dessert and theirs wasn't my favorite version but still very good! I like how the matcha flavor was strong and it was not too sweet at all. The one thing I didn't love was the gelatin/pudding stuff at the bottom because the texture was a little weird but the flavor was great! \n\nI will also add it is super weird that the restaurant is separated into two halves. I was in the tiny half with the kitchen but the servers have to walk outside on the street for like 30 feet and go to the other side to bring food. The interior is nice but the setup is odd. \n\nOverall, I really like Raku but I prefer the Soho location since it is a bit bigger so less wait times. If it weren't for the host I would give this place a 9.3/10 but it honestly brought it down since service is an important factor for me. I enjoy the udon here despite the gyunan missing a little bit of flavor for me and being somewhat pricey but I will definitely return to try some more unique udons.","review_date":"9/2/2025","category":"Food & Beverage"}

I enjoyed my udon very much but would I go out of my way, walking 8+ blocks from my train station... and do it all over again? Not really. Only if I'm around the area and by chance with no wait time. \n\nRaku was on my bookmarked spots for a while and then it kept popping up in my IG feed from a few ppl I follow... this one was definitely an \"influenced\" eat.","review_date":"29/10/2023","category":"Food & Beverage"}

The pieces were big and soo juicy, the chicken was dripping after every bite.\n- Ebiten Udon: 4.5/5 The noodles were definitely the best part of the dish - they were so soft and chewy!

In addition, it is common that most stalls usually more than happy to provide extra curry gravy.

{"company_name":"Encik Tan","stars":"4","text":"Read the low reviews here, think that it doesn't do Encik Tan justice and here's my review:\n\nFood: They sell your usual Encik Tan fares like Curry Rice, Fishball Noodles, etc. Not the best you can get, but definitely okay for its price. $5 for a standard set of curry rice (Add $0.30 for takeaway). Top-up $1 for a lime juice, mid-sized cup, okay for an individual. Damage less than $7 per pax, though there are more expensive menus.\n\nService: Like fast-food, prompt and neat. Payment options include cash and credit card. Strangely, they don't accept PayNow or PayLah, despite being in a university campus, which is supposed to be chic and trendy.\n\nAtmosphere: I've been to other Encik Tan branches which was really bad in terms of hygiene. This branch within NTU is air-conditioned and relatively clean.\n\nOverall, a 3 to low 4-star, but definitely not those low star reviews you have seen here, which are emotionally driven in my opinion, not fair from a food seller view by Encik Tan.","review_date":"2024-08-06T06:34:47.429Z","category":"food and beverages"}

{"company_name":"Saap Saap Thai","stars":"5","text":"This is a self-service HALAL Thai restaurant where order is placed on touch screen panels and payment is either thru the screen or at the cashier. I ordered the BEEF BOAT NOODLE DELUXE which is the most expensive among the boat noodle menu @ $10.90 a bowl.  It has a generous serving of tender beef slices, brisket cubes, tendons, and beef balls. These assorted beef meat are so tender, complimented with enough serving of  thin noodles cooked 'al dente', on a sour-sweet-spicy broth that is so refreshing to sip and slurp. The serving size and the delightful taste of the dish definitely justify the price. I also ordered their original Thai iced milk tea @ $3.00.  I'm not a fan of milk tea but ordered it just for the experience.  Fortunately, it is not the heavily sweetened serving that milk teas are known for. I would recommend this place as they have lots of varieties in their menu. I will definitely come back and try some other dishes.","review_date":"2023-03-20T10:51:16.642Z","category":"food and beverages"}

Will not come back again nor recommend anyone from wasting their money.\n\nAfter we paid and ordered a mango tango classic, we wanted to change the order to the one with ice cream which was one dollar more. However we were told by the counter staff that it will be $1.50 more because it will be considered an add-on. I asked \"can't change order?\" To which the lady replied \"cannot\". And that was just within 30sec of making the order, an order which she haven't even start preparing. She was the only staff there. I asked if the ice-cream version of the mango sticky rice was the same and the difference was just the ice-cream, to which she said yes.\nWe didn't wanna argue liao and so we just say \"nevermind\".\n\nNext our order came and it was a super sour mango sticky rice, we rated 1/5. I accidentally spilled the coconut milk syrup cup, losing 2/3 of the syrup and we went to the counter to ask if we can have another cup of syrup. It was a sealed cup and it was strangely tightly closed, resulting in a accident.\n\nTo my surprise the staff said, if it's spilled at the counter it will be free and we will have to pay $0.80 for another cup of coconut syrup. That's really expensive for just a tiny amount of coconut syrup. We thanked her but told her no.\n\nTimes are hard but really don't need such horrible pricing system. Not allowing us to change our order was clearly a hard sell to make us pay more.\n\nWas served by a lady in black, which according to the receipt should be the manager.

The brinjal was undercookedâ€”practically raw. We returned it and requested a re-cook, but the second version wasnâ€™t much better. It still tasted more like coconut water than curry.\nâ€¢\tTom Yum Soup: Lacked depthâ€”neither spicy nor sour. Ingredients were minimal: just two prawns, some frozen-tasting chicken pieces, and potato squid. Felt like shortcuts were taken with the broth.\nâ€¢\tFried Thai Egg: While flavorful, it was excessively oily and heavy.\n\nAlthough the pricing was on the cheaper side, the food quality fell short and were poorly prepared, with little care in cooking or presentation.

I had the pleasure of visiting it for the second time, this time accompanied by my family, and it truly left a lasting impression. The sheer quality of the food served surpassed our expectations, leaving all of us thoroughly satisfied.\n\nOne standout dish that captured our taste buds and brought us immense delight was the Tom Yum soup. Its tantalizing blend of flavors, combining the perfect balance of spicy, sour, and savory notes, was a true testament to the chef's skill. Each spoonful of the aromatic broth was a burst of culinary excellence that left us craving for more.\n\nAdditionally, the fired Hor Fun with wok taste was an absolute masterpiece. The skilled craftsmanship displayed in its preparation was evident from the first bite. The flat rice noodles were expertly stir-fried in a scorching hot wok, imparting a delightful smoky flavor and a slightly charred aroma. The combination of tender slices of meat, vibrant vegetables, and the tantalizing sauce made this dish an irresistible symphony of textures and flavors.\n\nNot stopping at these highlights, we also had the pleasure of savoring other delectable dishes that further enhanced our dining experience. The Thai Pandan Chicken, with its fragrant pandan leaves wrapping succulent pieces of marinated chicken, was a delightful fusion of aromatic herbs and juicy meat. The Garlic Chicken, on the other hand, delighted our taste buds with its rich garlicky flavor that permeated every bite, leaving us wanting more.\n\nTo complete our feast, we decided to try the Thai Cockles, and they did not disappoint. These plump and juicy shellfish were cooked to perfection, highlighting the unique briny taste that makes them a sought-after delicacy. The accompanying sauce added a delightful tanginess, elevating the dish to new heights.\n\nAll in all, our visit to this exceptional Thai Zhi Char stall in the west was nothing short of an outstanding culinary adventure. The food quality, attention to detail, and the overall dining experience were truly remarkable. We left the establishment with contented smiles on our faces, grateful to have discovered such a gem.

At 6:45pm, our order was yet to be delivered, however, from the live tracking on both the website & email, both stated that the order was being delivered. So decided to wait a little longer, thinking that the delivery could be a little later due to break fast time. By 7:10pm, the order was yet to be delivered. I called the branch from Upper Jurong since the order was coming from there. The manager from the said branch, named Dinesh, answered the call. It was stated by him that our order was number two in the queue & there was no delivery riders to send them out. We were shocked to hear that they had no riders at that timing, when it was closing to the time of breaking fast. Despite the frustration, Dinesh was still patient with us, through the call, & assured that we would be getting our order by 7:45pm. To add on, he said we could call them back if our order was not received by then. So we ate what we had first & at 7:45pm, our order was delivered. From the damped boxes & plastic, it can be seen that our order had been done way earlier but kept there for a while.\nThank goodness the food was scrumptious.

The fried ee mian was particularly bad â€” the oil used for frying tasted old and reused, which left a really unpleasant aftertaste. On top of that, the sauce was bland, and overall the dish just didnâ€™t work for me at all.\n\nWe also tried some of their dim sum. The fried mango prawn dim sum was another miss â€” once again, the bad oil taste stood out, and the mango was bland and tasteless, far from the sweet flavour you would expect. As for the chee cheong fan and fried carrot cake, they were alright, nothing exceptional but at least edible.\n\nOverall, I would say this place is just alright, but given the quality of the food, I would seriously reconsider visiting again.","review_date":"2025-04-27T15:07:17.731Z","category":"food and beverages"}

We booked the time of the dinner at 730pm but was only serve and provided with the seats at 830pm.  Nevertheless, the receipts ended up with 10% service charge.  As it is CNY, we did not dispute with the restaurant and made payment on that day.  It was after this that i checked on the CNY Menu we ordered and noted that there is indication that there is no service charge and the only \"+\" should only be the prevailing GST of 9%.\n\nI what's app the restaurant and request for a refund of this 10% over charge.  Was immediately answered with a call from the restaurant.  The in charge highlighted that the 10% charged was not service charge but surcharge for CNY and claim that she had spoken to me before.  I do not recall this communication instead highlighted to her that the menu sent to me clearly indicated that there is only prevailing GST on top of the CNY menu cost and clearly states that there is no service charge nor CNY surcharge mentioned.\n\nIf the dinner has been good for this dinner, we do not mind to take this as a tip to the team and not asked for this refund.  However, the reunion dinner was delayed from 730pm to 830pm and by the time ended was closed to 11pm.  My dad (elderly) was left with hungry stomach and food served around 9pm were not freshly prepared with some dishes already turning cold and not well heated.  My family's young children were cranky due to the long wait.\n\nSuch service do not deserve any service charges nor surcharge.  If only, the surcharge was clearly communicated in the menu, we may have picked another restaurant instead of this.  Thus, this is clearly a mis-interpretation of their cost.\n\nI tried speaking to their so-call boss, but sadly he said he can't do anything.  However, when i ask why this is not indicated clearly in the menu, he mentioned that this is their usual charge and that there is a notice on that day of the dinner which placed outside the door.  Isn't this not ethnical as customers are probably only aware when they are there.\n\nHope this can inform all about their restaurant CNY standard with underlining conditions that are not clearly stated on their menu cost.  Please be wary. I am taking this up with CASE now.  Hope they can provide us with a fair resolution.","review_date":"2025-02-09T01:53:50.485Z","category":"food and beverages"}

The hor fun comes with smooth, tender noodles drenched in a rich, savoury gravy. What makes it special is the wok hei â€“ that smoky, charred aroma that lingers with every bite, proof that the chef knows how to work the fire. Itâ€™s the kind of dish you crave on a rainy evening. On the other hand, the milky fish soup is hearty in a different way. The broth is creamy yet light, with a natural sweetness that blends beautifully with the fresh, firm slices of fish. It warms you up instantly, offering comfort without being cloying. Paired together, these two dishes show off SZ Kitchenâ€™s ability to deliver both wok-fired boldness and homely, soul-soothing flavours.

{"company_name":"The Crowded Bowl","stars":"1","text":"Food is good, but experience got drastically affected by the rude service staffs. I fundamentally believe if you don't like your job you should either quit or do something about it and not vent it on the business's customers. Either the owners is oblivious to the situation or the staffs are putting up a front.\n\nStaff wasnt patient at all when we asked about the ingredients displayed as there were no descriptions and it's our virgin visit. Asked for napkins if possible upon checkout and all 3 front staff quickly jumped on aggressively to say don't have, saw tissues at the cashier counter and asked if I could have one if not I could buy it and they said that's kitchen towels and not tissues so no. After seating down heard the staff complaining among themselves of how they haven't had their off days. I guess they are overwhelmed as they were are seating inside the counter on a toilet stool when we walked in. The place was empty tho with only 1 table of 2pax.\n\nFood was good and super value for money as recommended by a fellow alumni. I personally feel it's underpriced for the quality.\n\nTo the owners I hope you're seeing this as you have a great business given your NTU story, and it will be a waste if you lose customers over stupid unnecessary things like this. Super great fast service business model with exceptional prices and the last key to the lock is to have basic decent human to human respect from the service staffs. We are not even talking about any customer service here.","review_date":"2024-12-28T04:24:34.389Z","category":"food and beverages"}

{"company_name":"The Crowded Bowl","stars":"5","text":"The food was fulfilling and tasty. Their portion sizes are perfect for me, I can eat a normal cai fan 3 ingredients and feel satisfied so their normal bowl is just enough. My favourite ingredients are the mock fish, corn and one other veggie or meat depending on what I feel like. I'm not going to dock points, but there are some ingredients I feel are pretty rough and just don't fit in terms of flavour and texture, like the fishcake looking tofu has a grainy feel and is almost flavourless. Other than that, choose between savoury or sweet and sour sauces to complete your bowl. Oh, and their scrambled egg is top notch, extremely creamy, soft and fluffy if you're an egg fan.\n\nI dined in, and the experience was OK. Not too cold or hot, sometimes I guess one or two flies will make their way in due to the lack of a strong air-conditioning curtain?

Not much variety, no cooked food options like small bites. Raw items is quite limited as well. Shouldnâ€™t named fishballs, more like dough balls. Soup base is ok but ainâ€™t fantastic, your mouth gets very dry afterwards likely due to high in MSG. But comparing to the halal hotpot restaurant I been to itâ€™s slightly above average.","review_date":"2025-04-18T13:03:52.937Z","category":"food and beverages"}

If I could give a rating lower than zero, Iâ€™d give it -100. What kind of logic is thisâ€”calling it a restaurant but making it self-service?\n\nAnd to top it off, they still had the nerve to add a 20% surcharge for CNY Eve. Understand that is CNY charges but come on such services trash.\n\nWorst experience ever, Honestly, should I even pay that when everything is self-service?\n\nThere was a moment when all of our dishes had been cleared, but the new ones hadnâ€™t arrived yet. When they finally brought the new dishes, they just stood there holding them, waiting for us to clear the space ourselves?\n\nEven if itâ€™s self-service, they couldâ€™ve informed us about it beforehand, not after the dishes arrive, when we have to walk over and ask. Itâ€™s basic customer service to let your guests know in advance, and thatâ€™s something any restaurant or service crew should do.\n\nDonâ€™t use excuses like â€œtoo many peopleâ€ or â€œlack of staffâ€ â€“ thatâ€™s not the customerâ€™s issue, itâ€™s the restaurantâ€™s.

The standout was the steamed sea bass, the fish was fresh, the texture was delicate but robust. Their vegetables were well seasoned, with stir fried beans crisp and flavourful. The egg and tomato was a simple dish but was no less satisfying.\n\nTheir food also did not shy away in the spice area, with the heat making a balanced roundness to the dishes without being overpowering. For those not well acquainted with spice, Iâ€™m sure they are amenable to requests to taper the kick. Though I do recommend it for the experience.\n\nService was prompt and attentive, complementing the dishes served. Would come again.

It was not under â€œServingâ€, and no one had called my number (which I do not even understand since isnâ€™t the point of the screen is so no numbers need to be called)?\n\nSo I approached this male staff at the counter and asked if my order was ready since the number was not on the screen. He glanced at my receipt and said rudely and sarcastically, â€œMaâ€™am please wait it has only been 3 minutesâ€. Even had the cheek to glare. I tried telling him that I ONLY asked because my number had disappeared from the screen and he replied loudly and impatiently, â€œI will call the number when it is readyâ€ - as if I am supposed to be familiar with their messed up system. So much for the screen alert advising you to â€œPlease watch here for your numberâ€.\n\nThe patty on the cheeseburger was too salty, and the ice in my drink was already half melted.\n\nBased on the reviews Iâ€™ve seen here, McDonaldâ€™s should do something about the staff and system at this outlet.","review_date":"2024-03-15T22:37:51.086Z","category":"food and beverages"}

The manager did not bother looking at the receipt and brushed me off, saying it's an automated system, and if I can't wait, she's more than willing to refund. Really bad response, worsened by what follows:\n5 minutes later, another employee noticed that I've been there for quite some time and took a look at my receipt. She noticed something was very wrong and went back to the manager, who said she had already served the order since at 1730-something. Turns out they decided to serve dine-in orders in takeaway bags.\n\nI don't think that's a standard practice? They could at least put a sign saying they are doing so.

{"company_name":"McDonald's","stars":"1","text":"Iâ€™d like to express my disappointment regarding my experience at your Joo Koon outlet. This morning, I ordered the Big Breakfast set and requested for butter, something that has traditionally accompanied the meal. However, despite asking multiple times, the staff firmly insisted that butter is now chargeable.\n\nThis may seem like a small issue, but it had a surprisingly big impact on what should have been a simple, happy weekend breakfast. Being denied a basic condiment that was previously complimentary and is reasonably expected as part of a â€œBig Breakfastâ€ came across as unnecessarily petty and profit-driven.\n\nMcDonaldâ€™s has long been known in Singapore as a family-friendly restaurant that values customer satisfaction. If this is a shift in policy, I urge you to reconsider. Charging for something as basic as butter without informing customers in advance feels misaligned with the brand values many of us grew up with.\n\nWhile I understand rising costs and operational decisions, these changes shouldnâ€™t come at the cost of basic customer experience. A little butter should be part of the service, not an upsell!\n\nI hope this feedback is taken seriously, as this seemingly small policy change significantly affected my overall impression of McDonaldâ€™s today.","review_date":"2025-08-03T03:43:22.739Z","category":"food and beverages"}

Maybe it's because the hawker centre here is (apparently) the largest in Singapore with 226 stalls thereat albeit some of them not taken up when I was there today. Anyway, Chinatown Complex draws a lot of locals and tourists to its building and is a IMO historical icon in Chinatown. That said, the place may appear dingy to some, but heck, it's historical - and apparently, it's up for some refurbishment or more than that in 2026. The hawker centre is mostly serving Chinese or local Chinese cuisines with few or no other cuisines on offer.

Plenty of Teochew, Cantonese, Taiwan congee, frog porridge etc, but precious few that actually serve fried porridge.\n\nApparently originating from Malaysia, the ingredients are first stir fried in a wok under high heat before adding the porridge base. When done correctly, the wok hei aroma permeates throughout the porridge, adding an extra dimension to a dish that for many represents the epitome of comfort food.\n\nMy favorite example of this porridge however doesn't even make it to Google's list of fried porridge in Singapore (again, you get plenty of porridge that isn't actually fried). Add to that, WSL is located in an industrial area not easily accessible by public transport (the nearest MRT being Joo Koon which is a 15 min walk away).\n\nYou don't have to worry about eating cold porridge here.

The pastries are served warm and fresh, and the bowl dishes' toppings are tasty.

For those with smaller appetites, the small portion is surely adequate for lunch.\n\nOrdered the medium portion for $6. The noodles are fried in batches which explains the long queues. The Hokkien Mee here really conforms to my preference for wet, soupy type. Literally you can drink the left over broth. There is also ample wok heat and with the medium portion you get three shrimps, shell off tails on. The other major difference from other fried Hokkien Mee is that this stall does not use pork belly or squids. Instead they give you mock abalone which adds to the flavours of the noodles.\n\nSpeaking of flavours, my first mouthful imparted the Wow! factor. Coupled with the chilli sauce which packs quite the punch, the plate was slurped up within 10 mins, in spite of its size.

I was stopped from walking away to order my drinks after I have ordered, because my order was ready already. She merely scooped a huge ladle out of the ready wok for my $7 large order. Super red flag.\n\nBut all these red flags fell immediately upon my first sip of the broth. What in the world did they put into it? The crustaceans, wok hei, pork lard, seasonings, and the sambal belachan formed a formidable coalition force that penetrated deep into my taste buds. The full flavour was out of this world.\n\nMind you, the pork lard were not some fried pieces of pork fat lying around in a container. They were scooped out of bowl of pork oil, and it managed to retain its crispiness, and some. Similar to that used in bak chor mee, those dry pieces of mass-fried pork lard provided elsewhere, free-flow or not, cannot hold a candle to those served here.\n\nThe only gripe I have is that the noodles were a little soggy, probably owing to the fact that they have been sitting in the wok for a while, waiting for me.

Over here, itâ€™ll cost a whopping $7.80. Itâ€™s not like a famous tire company gave them a star either (if they did then pls take it away, itâ€™s trash tier quality).\nI believe part of their rationale behind the premium pricing is the Italian inspiration behind their food.

{"company_name":"Connect71 Cafe","stars":"1","text":"Rating this purely for the chocolate cake sold here. DISCLAIMER I SAY FIRST EVERYTHING ELSE HERE IS GOOD, I JUST WANT TO REVIEW THE CHOCOLATE CAKE. Letâ€™s start off with looks cos it was what intrigued me and my friend to want to buy it. We agreed that it looked like the cake from the Mr Bean TV animated series and the cake from Mathilda that Miss Trunchbull made Bruce eat. It sounds like weâ€™re glazing itâ€™s looks but that was rly what sold us to buying it. Was only $4 dollars and was splitting it two ways so each oni paid $2 so not the worst as well. Now here is where it went downhill and sent us into the five stages of grief.\n\nAct 1, DENIAL: First taste right off the bat, did not rly like it but still tried to convince myself that itâ€™s decent.\nAct 2, ANGER: The more we ate it, the more we realised how unexcusably bland it was. The texture screamed industrial cleaning sponge thatâ€™s never met moisture, the irony. And we were in disbelief and anger that we let our glutton appetite be fooled by the cakeâ€™s looks and price. Itâ€™s like we could use this to scrub a toilet and the toilet wouldâ€™ve probably apologised for the inconvenience.\nAct 3, BARGAINING: As we ate the cake, our anger turned into a struggle to find meaning of this cake. Saying how even cheap/ affordable cake stores like polar and primadeli can do a better job, cos their chocolate cakes actually have the taste of cocoa which doesnâ€™t seem like a hard requirement. Calling it a chocolate cake might have been a big slap to the face of cocoa farmers worldwide.\nAct 4, DEPRESSION: Reaching the end of the cake, we started to wallow in our thoughts and in our seats. Bloated from the amount of water we needed to drink to mask the weird aftertaste in our mouths after every bite. Saying, I miss how my mouth tasted before eating this.\nAct 5, ACCEPTANCE: Finally finishing the cake, we left the place, with Phlegmy throats induced due to the dryness and weird texture of the cake. Accepting what we had eaten and thereâ€™s nothing we can do about it. So moving forward, we will not be ordering this cake anymore. BUT, we will still be coming back to eat the other food like the mains and the drinks, those are super solid 4/5. Staff are also rly friendly 5/5.

It clung to every strand of noodle, wrapping the yellow noodles and bee hoon in a smoky hug. The gravy wasnâ€™t overly wet or too thick, just the right amount to coat without drowning and packed with that deep, slow-cooked seafood umami that only comes from proper prawn stock.\n\nThe prawns were fresh and had that satisfying snap when you bite into them, while the bits of squid added a nice chew. But the real surprise? The crispy pork lard scattered generously on top. Golden, crunchy, and sinful in the best way possible.\n\nMix in the chilli and a squeeze of lime and the whole thing transforms spicy, tangy, and even more addictive. I found myself scraping the plate for every last bit.\n\nIs it the healthiest meal? Definitely not.

Hongkong style plump wanton fill with adequate ingredients n seasoning for the punch.\n\n$7 for this bowl of comfort is 100% justifiable.

Unfortunately, my second experience was very disappointing due to poor hygiene practices. While preparing my food, a staff member used a straw to dig his teeth, did not wash his hands, and then handled my noodles with bare hands. When I asked him to wash his hands before continuing, he looked unhappy. I donâ€™t mind what people do in their own time, but anyone handling food should wash their hands before touching it especially after such actions. This is basic hygiene. For a stall claiming to be Michelin-grade, the hygiene standards of the staff were far below expectations.

(Joined the queue from 11:55am, and placed my order at 12:45pmâ€¦ waited for another 2 to 3 minutes for the noodles).\n\nAnyway, it was worth the effort as for S$7.00, you get a restaurant standard Noodles with Char Siew and Wanton. The Noodles were firm and chewy, and tossed in a well-balanced savoury dark sauce with generous amount of lard.\n\nAdded a small scoop of sambal chilli to elevate the overall flavour further, however be advise not to add too much as it may be too salty for some.\n\nTheir Char Siew steals the spotlight with glistening caramelised edges, delicated balance of sweet, savoury and smoky too. Slices were slightly charred outside by tender and juicy inside, with a good mix of lean and fatty layers. Quite imilar to what was being served in Chef Kangâ€™s Private Dining previously, but with even better ratio of lean and fatty layers, but cost about 3 times more. However i am not too sure if both are related, but both had similar logo.\n\nWantons were plump and filled with generous amount of minced pork plus other bits of ingredients, wrapped in silky skins and boiled till tender, served with rich and flavourful chicken broth on the side.\n\nWill return again during off peak period on weekdays, as its too crowded on Sunday due to patronization of many familiesâ€¦ Not only difficult to find seats due to the awkward seating arrangement of a canteen, but also uncomfortable to dine.","review_date":"2025-08-04T13:24:50.220Z","category":"food and beverages"}

{"company_name":"Crave Nasi Lemak","stars":"1","text":"Hi CRAVE Nasi Lemak , Im referring this to your Joo Koon fairprice hub branch.\n\nI ordered a nasi lemak ayam berempah today, meant to be given to the kids. However, I found it upsetting and off putting when i saw the following scene unfolded right before my eyes.\n\nYour employee, who was packing the order was sneezing openly with no cover. Granted, the person tried to turn away from the food area but still sneezed openly, multiple times.\n\nShe then proceded to wear a black mask.\n\nSubsequently, before she continued packing, she was wiping her nose with a tissue while having the food gloves on. I did not see which hand (gloved or not) which was used to wipe her nose. Nonetheless, she did NOT EVEN WASH HER HANDS prior to packing the food.\n\nLooking at this disgusting behavior, i did not even want to inform your staff and walked away without collecting the food, even though payment had been made.\n\nFor an F&B business, i believe staff should be well aware of hygiene when operating the store. This was actually food meant to be given to kids and the lack of hygiene awareness is baffling.\n\nHope you would take the necessary actions to prevent this from happening.

Check.\nDon't want food too spicy? Check.\n\nHi noodle is healthy fast food, for small crowd who wants to eat and leave. All the food start out a bit low-salt and low-spice. I've tried suan la fen and chicken liver noodles and I was quite disappointed initially, but then I saw the condiment counter with chilli, soya sauce, vinegar and then I realise - oh thats why. If you want healthy, you found the right place. If you want more seasoning, you've gotta masterchef it yourself.\n\nFor sides, I've tried a lot. Here are some personal favourites:\nPotato åœŸè±†ä¸ $3.90  vinegary, not spicy.\nBraised Quail eggs $4\nKing oyster mushroom $2.50\nMinced garlic pork è’œæ³¥ç™½è‚‰ $5.80 (fantastic!)\nMapo tofu $4.90 (not spicy, not salty)\n\nBelieve it or not, I ate all the above with brown rice ($2). I can't believe I'm eating brown rice at Haidilao chain, but yes. Healthy. If I didn't order pork, it felt like Greendot healthy. Nothing was salty, so those looking to cut salt, this place is for you.\n\nIce cream is fabulous. Better than mcdonalds. Wafer cone was crispy and sweet, and the ice cream wasnt icy, but very thick, rich and creamy.\n\nInclusive of GST, no service charge (no one dancing with noodles or singing bday song or giving your kids toys)\nNot sponsored.","review_date":"2024-07-07T04:37:25.097Z","category":"food and beverages"}

However as the chili provided was only chili soaked in oil, this did not help with the taste at all. Noodles were so hard I suspect they were under cooked.

Overall, it was an enjoyable breakfast.","review_date":"2024-12-05T23:47:01.561Z","category":"food and beverages"}
{"company_name":"Heng Soon Noodle House","stars":"1","text":"Very bad queuing arrangement. Was told to queued away from the main queue near to the side table. It is good as to not to block the passageway. However, nobody is at the last of the main queue to tell those come later to join the other queue. Thus, the side queue will have to wait longer as \"cut queue\" keep happening... Very bad arrangement, making people frustrated.","review_date":"2025-08-07T00:53:52.748Z","category":"food and beverages"}

And their food was exactly what I imagined it to be. Rendezvous.\n\nLet's start with the lemak gravy.\nIt was rich but not too sinful or else you know the cholesterol is gonna climb up. The vegetables in the lontong was generous. Then we move to the rice cake.\nRice cake was soft and fresh. What more can you ask for? Pretty straightforward. And the hard boiled egg to compliment lontong. Lastly, the sambal was on point. Not too spicy to a point where it will be uncomfortable, but it was balance. Good enough to give that gravy a kick!\n\nSo if you're around the corner, come give this family stall a try, and enjoy the food.","review_date":"2023-07-28T18:48:59.776Z","category":"food and beverages"}
