{"company_name":"Apex Medical Centre Pte Ltd","stars":"1","text":"If youâ€™re looking for poor diagnosis, wasted time, and rude customer service, this clinic is the place to go.\n\nI had the unfortunate experience of visiting this clinic twice in 2024, both times being consulted by Dr. Goh.\n\n1.\tAugust 2024 â€“ I sprained my thumb, and the pain extended to my wrist. I explained that I couldnâ€™t move my thumb, and my wrist was in significant pain. Dr. Goh briefly examined my wrist and simply stated that it was sprained. He prescribed ointment, but the pain worsened over the next week. I later visited a polyclinic where the doctor provided a more thorough assessment, diagnosing a nerve injury in my wrist that required a steroid injection. After being referred to a hospital and receiving the injection, I recovered fully within three days.\n\n2.\tSeptember 2024 â€“ I experienced heavy menstrual bleeding for two weeks. Dr. Goh advised me to take Norethisterone for 20 days to stop the flow. When I asked if it was necessary to take it for so many days, he insisted it was. He also added that I should take high blood pressure pills, despite me telling him I donâ€™t have high blood pressure. He tested my blood pressure three times and insisted it was abnormal. I explained that Iâ€™ve had low blood pressure most of my life and that the elevated reading might be due to panic after bleeding excessively. He refused to reconsider, claiming that high blood pressure pills would reduce the bleeding. When I tested my blood pressure at home, it was normal.\n\n3.\tPatient Privacy Concerns â€“ Thereâ€™s absolutely no regard for patient privacy in this clinic. Two of the counter staff (packing medication and collecting payments) are respectful, speaking softly when dealing with patientsâ€™ personal information. However, the two seated behind the counter never get up and instead shout out patientsâ€™ full names, NRIC numbers, house addresses, and phone numbers for everyone to hear. During both of my visits, I witnessed them shouting at elderly patients. On one occasion, an elderly man mentioned it was his first time at the clinic, and the staff loudly responded, â€œWhy must you come here?â€ I also saw a middle-aged woman buying medication without her physical NRIC. Instead of proper verification, the seated staff simply asked her to recite her NRIC number and proceeded to sell the medication. Isnâ€™t this dangerous? Why isnâ€™t there a proper process in place? People come to the clinic unwell â€“ the least they deserve is respectful treatment.","review_date":"2024-10-02T16:18:30.943Z","category":"Arts"}

{"company_name":"Apex Medical Centre Pte Ltd","stars":"5","text":"I dare say this clinic's handling covid the best out of the 4 clinics in the area.\n\nThey actually had signs out to tell patients when the queue is full (I highly recommend putting Chinese / Malay / Tamil signs too, at the side of the counter facing out to the door. Might help elderly patients and foreign workers who do not know English). This is already a world of difference from another clinic I shall not name, which I waited at for 30 mins yesterday only to be told to head over to the next door clinic and wait for 2.5H, because I'm not company sponsored. (They didn't even put a sign, srsly. Half the queue were not company sponsored.)\n\nThey also had special signs for people who self-tested ART positive too. Unlike yet another clinic in the area I shall not name, which claimed to do Swab tests online but turned me away in person saying 'no swab test here', APEX is legit. They understood the need when I told them I'm ART positive. They accommodated me when I asked if I could be given a queue no. for couple of hours later, despite the queue being full. Sure their phone line may be down, but their in-person service definitely benefits from that.\n\nService-wise, the staff were most efficient and polite, and I'm really thankful to Dr Tay, who cracked a joke when she saw how sombre I was about getting covid. The brave lady did not even bulk when I pulled down my mask, despite my fear of transmitting Covid to her. Kudos to her!\n\nIf there is one complain I do have, it would be the signage out at the front. It's good that APEX gets along so well with the Universal Dental Group that they even share similar letter fonts, but at first, I didn't dare go in thinking I might end up strapping myself in for a teeth drilling session. Now's not the time for sure, but in the future, when Covid does lighten up, hopefully the clinic will consider rebranding with different letter fonts, if not add an Upstairs and Downstairs Arrow logo alongside the different establishments.","review_date":"2022-02-08T12:21:48.757Z","category":"education"}

After about 40 days, the filling developed a problem and it hurt when I drank cold water. So, I suspect that the material has fallen out, but of course, it could be something else, so I want to go for a review. Dr. Mok said she would remove the previous material and replace it with one that was temporary and did not guarantee results. I expressed my concern because once the medication failed, my teeth would be exposed and more damage would be done. Then,  after I refused to use this material, I asked if I could use the original material and Dr. Mok refused. So I decided not to change because, after all, no one wants to revert to a temporary, less good-looking material without taking that much risk. Dr. Mok went on to say that if I were to leave, she would have to take a photograph of my teeth to prove that there was nothing wrong with her fillings. I thought this was utterly ridiculous. If she was so adamant that there was no problem, why did she change me to a bad material in the first place? If I don't change the material, do I have to prove that her padding is fine? I felt that she was simply shirking her responsibility. She would not allow me to leave if I refused to have my photo taken because the case had to be documented.

{"company_name":"Gleneagles Hospital","stars":"1","text":"Premium hospital, substandard service\n\nI wish to express my deep disappointment with the service standards at Gleneagles Hospital, following my admission experience earlier this week.\n\nI arrived at 8:00am for admission and collected a queue number, only to find the queue completely stagnant. When I approached the counter staff, I was brushed off with â€œwait a whileâ€ â€” without explanation, updates, or communication. Eventually, after wasting much time, I was told to proceed to the Day Admission Ward at Level 7.\n\nWhat followed was even worse. The staff at the ward counter literally tossed the admission letter at me and asked me to sign, with no guidance or courtesy. When I asked twice for clarification, I was given casual, dismissive gestures that turned out to be misleading. Even when I highlighted the mistake, the staff remained cold and indifferent. While a manager eventually came forward to apologise, there was no sincerity or accountability â€” only a token gesture.\n\nOn top of that, the food served was shockingly inadequate for a hospital that positions itself as â€œprestigious.â€ Breakfast consisted of plain porridge with tofu and peanuts, accompanied only by black coffee. Cold milk was provided only upon request. There was no fruit, no proper protein, and certainly no sign of a balanced or nutritious diet. For patients who are supposed to be recovering, such meals fall far short of basic expectations, and one must question if they even meet minimum hospital nutrition standards.\n\nWhat shocked me further was the complete lack of follow-up. Until my discharge, I never once received a call or visit from Gleneaglesâ€™ management. By contrast, hospitals such as KKH and Thomson respond almost immediately to patient complaints, often sending senior staff to check on patients personally. Gleneaglesâ€™ silence reflected indifference, not care.\n\nFor a hospital that charges premium rates and brands itself as a top-tier institution, this experience was utterly disappointing. Patients come to Gleneagles expecting care, respect, professionalism, and proper recovery support â€” but what I encountered was stagnation, disregard, and even nutritionally questionable food.\n\nGleneagles should remember: healing is not just about medicine, but also dignity, respect, and nourishment. Anything less is unacceptable.","review_date":"2025-08-19T05:15:00.111Z","category":"Retail"}

Despite paying a significant amount with the expectation of receiving world-class care, the service and professionalism we encountered were severely lacking.\n\nKey concerns include:\nâ€¢\tUnprofessional Conduct by ICU Staff: Nurse Corina and another filipino male nurse displayed dismissive, rude, and mocking behavior toward our family members. Reasonable requests and questions were met with false information, poor attitudes, and a lack of empathy â€” all of which are unacceptable in a healthcare environment.\n\nâ€¢\tDisrespectful Behavior by Dr. Roger Tan: Dr. Tanâ€™s tone became increasingly sarcastic and impatient, particularly when we needed to translate medical updates for a family member who does not speak English. Need to translate to Palembang dialect. In addition, conflicting medical opinions among ICU doctors about dialysis treatment created confusion and concern over the consistency of care.\n\nâ€¢\tLack of Communication and Continuity: After initially encouraging open communication, Dr. Tan became less responsive. Despite our familyâ€™s efforts, including arranging an SOS medical evacuation and bearing high costs.  There was no notable improvement in our grandfatherâ€™s condition. During a critical phase, both primary doctors left the country for a conference, handing the case over to a new doctor unfamiliar with the situation.\n\nâ€¢\tConcerns Over Staffing Levels: Night shifts appeared to be understaffed, with a few nurse on duty for many ICU patients, raising serious questions about patient safety and monitoring. One is to two patients.\n\nGiven the circumstances and the substantial financial and emotional investment our family made, we are extremely disappointed with the level of care received. We urge fellow Indonesians and other international families to carefully consider their options before seeking treatment at Gleneagles Hospital.","review_date":"2025-05-23T08:45:53.757Z","category":"education"}

{"company_name":"Mount Alvernia Hospital","stars":"1","text":"Initially admitted to St. Francis Ward, I endured significant distress due to complications from general anesthesia (GA). I was unable to pass urine from midnight onwards and repeatedly told the nurses that my bladder felt like it was going to explode. Despite my clear and urgent complaints, the nurses performed a bladder scan and insisted my bladder was â€œnot very full.â€ When they finally catheterized me after hours of agony, they drained an alarmingly large amount of urineâ€”nearly double what they claimed was present. This dismissive and negligent attitude from the nurses was deeply upsetting and left me feeling unheard and invalidated.\nThe catheterization process was nothing short of a nightmare. Two nurses attempted to insert the catheter multiple times, causing excruciating pain and leaving me screaming. After several failed attempts, a senior nurse was finally called in to complete the procedure, and while her skill brought some relief, the overall process was traumatic. Even after the catheter was in place, I continued to experience pain and repeatedly raised this with the nurses. I specifically asked if they could check the catheter because of the persistent pain. One nurse brushed me off, saying, â€œOf course it would be painful; it is a foreign body in you,â€ and didnâ€™t even bother to examine it. This complete lack of compassion and willingness to investigate my concerns was infuriating. When I was finally transferred to St. Raphael Wardâ€”where the nurses were much kinderâ€”the difference in care was immediately apparent. The nurses there asked me about the catheter, and when I mentioned that it still felt painful, they were prepared to check it. However, the same senior nurse from St. Francis Ward who was assisting with my transferâ€”the one who had repeatedly dismissed my concernsâ€”intervened and brushed off my complaint yet again, saying, â€œItâ€™s just discomfort.â€ Is she the one being catheterized? Her consistent dismissal of my pain, even when other staff were willing to help, was completely unacceptable, unprofessional, and uncompassionate.\nThis same senior nurse, who consistently dismissed my concerns, also exhibited aggressive and demeaning behavior throughout my stay. She scolded my caregiver in an unnecessarily harsh and condescending tone for helping me walkâ€”a practice that my physiotherapist had explicitly approved. Not content with berating my caregiver, she then turned on me, speaking to me as though I were a child being punished. This was deeply humiliating and entirely uncalled for, especially given the already distressing circumstances I was enduring. Her behavior and repeated dismissive attitude made an already distressing experience feel unbearable. Their discharge process seems to required a complete transformation. Given that I could not walk and relied on a wheelchair, it was incredibly inconvenient and unreasonable to expect me to make my way to a different department to collect my medications. A hospital should prioritize patient convenience, especially for those with limited mobility, but this process was thoughtlessly designed. On top of that, they provided an interim bill during discharge, which required me to pay an excess. They explained that this was not the final bill and that the excess would be refunded once the bill was finalized. Why am I being charged for an interim bill that is not even finalized? This makes no sense and creates unnecessary administrative hassle. I have never encountered such a practice in other hospitals, and it speaks to a system that prioritizes inefficiency. This was my first experience at Mt. A, and it will undoubtedly be my last. The dismissive attitudes, lack of competence, aggressive behavior from staff, and poorly designed processes made this an incredibly distressing experience. For a Catholic hospital that claims to â€œserve all with love,â€ my experience felt entirely devoid of compassion or professionalism.","review_date":"2025-06-28T07:34:55.872Z","category":"retail"}

{"company_name":"Sengkang General Hospital","stars":"1","text":"I am writing on behalf of my husband, who recently had a highly distressing and unacceptable experience at your Emergency Centre. From the very moment we entered, we were deeply disappointed by the lack of professionalismâ€”registration staff were laughing and talking among themselves instead of attending to patients, which was both inconsiderate and unprofessional.\n\nAt the triage stage, the situation was no better. The staff did not even look at my husbandâ€™s wound, despite him being in visible pain and distress. After being made to wait for hours in what was supposed to be an emergency setting, the only treatment offered to him was paracetamol. This was shocking and unacceptable, especially given that his arm was in fact fractured. We had no choice but to go to another emergency centre where he finally received the urgent and proper care he required.\n\nWhat makes this matter even more concerning is that my husband was not the only one neglected. Many other patients were also left unattended for hours, without updates, care, or compassion. This shows a wider systemic issue rather than an isolated incident.\n\nThis entire experience raises very serious concerns: how can patients place their trust in medical professionals who overlook critical injuries, fail to show basic empathy, and dismiss urgent conditions? Emergency centres are meant to provide immediate, accurate, and compassionate care. Instead, my husband and many others were subjected to neglect, mismanagement, and unprofessional behaviour at multiple levels of your service.\n\nI strongly urge the hospital to review this incident in detail and take immediate action to ensure that such lapses never happen again. No patient should be made to suffer unnecessarily in an emergency setting. I also request a written response from your management outlining the corrective measures that will be taken, and accountability from the staff involved.","review_date":"2025-08-28T04:56:02.226Z","category":"Retail"}

{"company_name":"Sengkang General Hospital","stars":"4","text":"Iâ€™m not going to comment on the A&E because, to me, the reality of healthcare today is clear. Iâ€™ve waited three hours for a specialist appointment at private hospitals, so I understand that demand is high and manpower shortages are real. Thereâ€™s no point ranting or blaming the hospital it wonâ€™t change the situation. If people already have their own perceptions, nothing will change their mindset unless they experience it themselves.\n\nThe A&E at Sengkang General Hospital is always packed, with staff constantly on their feet. People need to understand that the system is stretched, and unnecessary visits only add to the burden.\n\nI experienced a delayed diagnosis, likely because my symptoms seemed routine due to my job. But the pain was affecting my daily life. When I finally got the right treatment, the care I received was more compassionate than I had ever expected even more than what I felt from some colleagues.\n\nDr. Stanley Angkodjojo and his team in PATU, including nurses Cheryl, Michelle, Khatijah, Fen Fen, Pen Anbu, Xiu Hui, and NC Pua, were truly dedicated. While I was receiving care, they never stopped moving constantly running up and down, checking on me and other patients, never once having the chance to sit. I could hear their concern as they reassured patients, making sure everyone was looked after. Despite their hectic workload, they still took the time to be kind and attentive.\n\nWhen I visited Dr. Stanley for my appointment, his treatment worked, and my symptoms were finally under control. Life felt normal again. Iâ€™m grateful to have been cared for by such a professional and compassionate doctor. I also want to acknowledge his PSA in the clinic, a Malay lady whose name I didnâ€™t catch. She was incredibly patient, taking time to explain details, especially to elderly patients. His clinic nurse, whose name I also missed, was just as kind and attentive.\n\nHaving accompanied my mother and grandmother to different hospitals, I know how tough healthcare can be. I donâ€™t make unreasonable requests because I see the pressure these professionals are under.

I even asked the doctor of the possibility of a disc injury and he said the x ray does not show any signs of it (a quick Google search immediately states that X rays can't detect disc damage) I insisted on an MRI as i had back sprains before and this one felt different but the doctor refused to give me an MRI at all.\n\nGot tired of waiting and went to CGH because they were supposedly faster. First consultation there and they immediately gave me an MRI appt and suspected it was something more serious than a mere sprain. 2 months later after the MRI its confirmed to indeed be a bulging disc.\n\nBaffled by this protocol of needing to wait 3 months just to be able to give their patient an MRI...

When I asked the staff if a 3-hour wait was normal, I was just told, â€œSometimes, because the doctor is busy.â€ At the 4-hour mark, I really couldnâ€™t take it anymore.\n\nI asked another staff member for help, and only then did they bring my appointment slip to a nurse and get a junior doctor to see me first. At this point I was holding back tears at that point I was so emotional and tired.\n\nOn top of that, their appointment booking and payment system is a mess. I had to personally go up to Level 1 just to get a queue number to book my CT scan, then go down to B1 to select a date. After that, I had to go back to the clinic to pass the appointment details. When I simply asked a nurse to confirm whether I needed to pay today (since Iâ€™m using Medisave), I got scoffed at, she literally said, â€œI told you already, right?â€ when I was just trying to double-check.\n\nAs i nurse myself I was being so patient despite the long wait and poor communication, but this experience was beyond frustrating.

(Can't recall her name.) After doing a urine test, I was told I had only a mild infection and was prescribed just one single dosage of antibiotics.\n\nI thought this was weird, because from what I read online, UTIs require a few days of antibiotics to be treated, but hey, I'm not a doctor, and we all know not to trust what we read online.\n\nAlthough symptoms subsided after a day, they returned after a few days. I thought I could treat it at home by drinking lots of water to flush out the bacteria, but it only worsened.\n\nUpon visiting the polyclinic today and doing another urine test, I was told I had a very high infection count and the doctor even wanted to send the urine sample for further analysis. This time I was prescribed a week's of antibiotics.\n\nI couldn't help feel and think that I could've avoided the UTI progressing to a more serious stage (and thus a lot of frustration and discomfort) if I had been prescribed with adequate treatment during my first consultation at PanCare Medical Jurong East. The one single dosage of antibiotics also cost me $20, but it's more the issue with what I perceive as receiving inadequate medication to begin with that prompts me to leave this review, especially when I had trusted this clinic with my health after reading many positive reviews here.","review_date":"2025-03-08T06:51:55.054Z","category":"Arts"}

Donâ€™t even bother considering this clinic because of how unprofessional the doctor is. Specifically, Dr Raj Khammall.\n\nI was having dry eye syndrome and politely requested the doctor for a referral letter to see a specialist. He responded by saying, â€œfor what purpose? Dry eye?â€ with a frown and looked confused. I repeated by saying, â€œyes, I have dry eyes for 3 months already and I need a referral letter to see a specialist for my condition because the antibiotic that one of the doctor gave me at this clinic was ineffective.â€ Afterwards he told me in a frustrated tone, â€œspecialist? This (Keat Hong Family Clinic) is a private clinic u know, u need to go to polyclinic to get a referral letter from them.â€ I told him that I had a referral letter from this clinic before previously. He then asked, â€œu got CHAS card?â€ I placed it on the table and he reacted by pushing the CHAS card back to me and said, â€œdonâ€™t give me, give the counter person.â€\n\nI just canâ€™t believe a doctor would carry out his duties in such an unprofessional manner. Iâ€™ve never encountered such a horrible situation before at any clinics. Iâ€™ve also never seen this doctor before at this clinic so maybe heâ€™s new? If yes, I would highly encourage the clinic to recommend him training courses for him to upskill himself or rather, get his character/behaviour right first in order to perform professionally at the workplace.\n\nCanâ€™t believe I spent $36 just for this horrible consultation experience. Made a feedback through email to the clinic and they reacted by saying that theyâ€™ll talk to the doctor only and even reminded me to not take any pictures.

I am trained to uncover the root cause as an engineer, before designing a solution. As an experienced HR practitioner, I do not prescribe approaches that address symptoms. One easy but wrong way is to throw training at an employee when the harder right is to give him or her the unpleasant but truthful feedback. Few want and dare to do whatâ€™s necessary to help others.\n\nI once asked Dr Chuang why he chose to be a GP when he is a world renowned specialist. He told me he injured his hand and could no longer be a surgeon.

However, once the clinic opened, she was rejected for the checkup and was told she would need to return on Sunday instead.\n\nWhen my helper called to inform me, she was told the reason for the rejection was that the male doctor on duty could not perform a blood draw for her, and that a female doctor would only be available on Sunday. I found this explanation puzzling, so I called the clinic myself for clarification.\n\nDespite my attempts to understand the situation, I was only told again that the male doctor cannot take her blood, with no valid explanation provided. I even asked whether the doctor was a trainee (which could explain certain limitations), but was told he was not. I also asked whether a nurse could perform the blood draw, and was informed that the clinic does not have a nurse.\n\nI find this situation extremely frustrating. My helper waited nearly an hour outside the clinic, only to be turned away and asked to return two days later. This feels both inefficient and inconsiderate, especially since no prior notice was given about the limitations of your staff or service.\n\nI would appreciate it if someone could explain why this happened, and more importantly, advise where I can escalate this feedback so that other patients do not face similar experiences in the future.\n\nThank you for your attention, and I hope to receive a proper explanation soon.","review_date":"2025-06-27T01:04:11.310Z","category":"Arts"}

We understand that the waiting time is long but we were ok with it, as long as we are able to get treated. The doctors are generally nice, patient and thorough when we consult them. The counter staff were ok in general. However, my recent experience in this clinic was disappointing. The counter staff was extremely rude and impatience. I politely asked a question about collection of medication (we waited for at least 20-30 mins already but still not called upon to collect) but received the following unpleasant responses:\n- Wait... Can you wait? Wait for few minutes... Just wait...\n- I am very busy. You just have to wait... Doctor still need to XXX\n- Doctor, can you XXX, the patients are complaining already\nWe understand that the counter staff may be busy (by the way there are 2 counter staff). As patients/family members, we do not want to make things difficult for the staff. What we wanted from the counter staff was that our responses to be answered politely, and be respected. I sat inside the clinic and observed that this counter lady, for every question that patients asked, her responses would be very hostile and rude, and unpleasant. One patient claimed that he was asked to come down to the clinic at 10.30am, but this counter rudely responded \"No, I did not said that (x2)\". The patient left the clinic, probably feeling why he was treated that unpleasant way when he was already sick.\n\nAll in all, doctors are good, but the system in terms of registration and medication collection needs to be improved. What is more important is, the counter staff (working on 26 Dec morning), needs to work the way she responds to patients. If every patients that asked you a question and you need to be so reactive, defensive, hostile and rude, then the problem lies with herself. She is busy, the clinic is busy, but so are we.

While the doctor who frequently check me at JMC was there, she didn't even check or speak to me. Just gave a quick glance and left. 3 days after i gave birth, the nurses from JMC called me and ask if I'm going to come for my next appointment.

He mentioned that my mum delayed her cataract op and further delaying will result in failure of the op. However, my mum has been going to JMC for her regular checks for the past 5 years, and never once did the JMC doctors recommend for her to go for cataract op. Also, how can a doctor mentioned that the surgery will fail, causing unnecssary alarm to the patient. In addition, Dr Hao Lei said my mum's cataract cannot be delayed any longer, but he never folllow up to schedule any appointment for the op.\n\nTherefore, I requested the doctor to refer my mum to SNEC for op if JMC is unable to handle her case. To my shock, Dr Hao Lei's attitude changed. He said \"ok loh, its your choice and that he could only write a discharge letter.\n\nFor now, I am planning to bring my mum for her cataract surgery via the private route as I have lost confidence in JMC's doctors' professionalism.","review_date":"2025-04-05T13:31:14.063Z","category":"retail"}

(Lady with thick & weird tatooed eyebrows). I came in at 8.35pm on 21 April 2025 and was told by the elderly clinic assistant that its closed. I told her it's not even close to 9pm yet. Plead my case coz i just got off from work. Then being told off by this thick eyebrowed clinic assistant on why did i came late, if she accept im the last patient she will go home late coz she also got family. Then came the worst part. Ask me if im under company clinic which i replied yes. She added some more you never pay, i still need to key in all the details for you and will cause her to go home late if she accept me as last patient. Im not sure if she knows every visit i still have to pay, the difference is being deducted via my payslip. What kind of stupid and unprofessional comment is this.\n\nI smiled and then left, writing this review in another professional clinic. My family of 5 has been a regular at Dr Ben's clinic. Even my elderly mother in law that lives in Yishun came here for her calcium injection regularly despite paying a premium coz of Dr Ben. But because of one clinic assistant ignorant attitude, this will be the last and final visit from my whole family.\n\nUnprofessional clinic assistant/ nurse. Not even close to closing time, when i left the clinic being rejected, it was 8.35pm. Don't need to give excuse company panel gives u more paperwork, that's your job. I will recommend my parkway panel insurance company to review the huge paperwork that you need to do. Infact, don't be a panel provider if you can't handle it. I appreciate you have a family and need family time but that's between you and ur employer. And my final advice to this lady is to smile.\n\nSince the start of the year i've visited this clinic multiple times due to my kids illness, this lady facial expression leaves alot to be desired. Not friendly and leaves a bad fengshui to the clinic. Wishing you all the best Dr Ben and Martin. You lost my family services and those that i recommended will be duly notified. I guess im not the only person to comment on ur nurses, see screenshot.\n\nPrevious 4 or 5 visit:\nServed by Dr Benedict. Cool and easy going doctor. Knows his stuff well.

Dentist went straight into the procedure without any assessment done.\n\n- The scaling and polishing procedure took < 15 mins. The whole session feels extremely rushed and brief. This is despite me informing the dentist that my last scaling was > 1 year ago . All my prior experiences with other clinics usually take about 30mins at the least.\n\nAll in all, I left feeling disappointed and questionable on whether my teeth was checked properly, or even cleaned properly, which is exacerbated by the fact that clinic has such great google reviews.

From the desk & administrative staff, to the dentists and assistants, all of the staff are amazing. In particular, Dr Natalie is incredibly meticulous and presents a level of attentiveness and care that reflects her passion and high expertise. I usually dread the biyearly cleaning sessions when it comes to the average dentist, however, Dr Natalie's assuring demeanour, constant check-ins and technical grasp provides a pain-free and fast experience. When she was making my retainers (which previously broke due to my bruxism / teeth grinding), she took put in time and effort, going above and beyond to specially tune my retainer to maximise my comfort and retainer lifespan (i think the lifespan of my retainer has almost tripled or more). She listens attentively and explains everything as needed and appropriate. I would believe that this standard of service is the ideal highest benchmark for all healthcare staff throughout all fields and specialities, albeit we must also acknowledge and respect the struggles and difficulties that come with being in the healthcare industry. Nonetheless, since my previous numerous experiences with doctors in multiple areas, I have had a generally bad impression and perception of doctors.

{"company_name":"MY Clinic","stars":"1","text":"I only used this clinic because they were the only ones in my neighbourhood on my corporate insurance panel.  Pretty average standard level of expertise for GPs. The doctors there are friendly enough, although the clinic always looked messy.\n\nI opted to use them for Healthier SG programme, after the lead GP sold me a very nice pitch. that was in Dec 2023.  I was also encouraged to email them, which i did. I sent an email on 2 Jan 2024, which went on to be unanswered for MONTHS.  Follow up emails and even phone calls were unanswered and when I finally managed to get through, it was already 19 July 2023.  All i got from the receptionist Lavina was \"did you?\" when I told her about the email.\n\nSo apparently no one checks the only email account of the clinic but Lavina. Either that, my email is not deemed important enough to open.  In the end, my treatment was kept in status quo and I didnt start my HSG programme till much later.\n\nWhen queried, all i got was a very insincere \"As spoken on the phone on 20 July 2024, we have conveyed our apologies and we are again sorry to hear of the cost concerns with your specialist\", without the lead GP even acknowleging that his team messed up and dropped the ball on me. The fact that my emails and calls were unanswered for more than 7 months was the MAIN ISSUE, which the clinic didnt want to address. I am pretty sure if i hadnt called, it would have gone on to remain unanswered.\n\nI was told in an email on 22 July 2024 that the delay was due to the clinic having to \"clarify a few things with ALPs and AIC as to the drugs eligible under HSG\". It must have been arduous, having to require more than 7 months.\n\nI have since enrolled with another clinic for HSG. They are further away from my home, but at least the Physician there follows up on me regularly.  I feel very cared for by my new Physician, who clearly is invested in my welbeing.  I guess when you put patient's needs before monetary gains, this will happen.\n\nSometimes, it is better to just admit mistakes and not deny making them.","review_date":"2024-09-08T05:00:28.202Z","category":"education"}

From my first visit to my latest the quality of care and professionalism has been exceptional.

Without his skill, attention, and personal care I wouldnâ€™t be here to write this review. And Dr. Pang was also one of my physicians. Both of these gentlemen were and are two of the finest diagnosticians I have ever encountered anywhere in the world. Their skills, insight, compassion, and just plain, exceptional medical knowledge puts them head and shoulders above any physician group I have ever seen. Going forward I can only say if you were looking for the finest quality healthcare you start at the Ming Clinic. There is no finest anywhere in the world.

Doesnâ€™t help that my wisdom tooth extractions years later was also very bad and traumatic (back then I screamed in the chair when I realized I could still feel pain as the dentist started pulling at my teeth - literal nightmare played out in real life).\n\nBut as I explained to the clinic my super fear of the dentist, they were very assuring and accommodating to my situation. They took special note of my situation, and right from the reception nurse at registration (sorry I didnâ€™t get your name) to the doctor doing the procedure and even the assistant were very gentle and assuring to me. Doctor Russell explained every step of the way for me, what he will do, what I should expect and feel, and made sure to check that I didnâ€™t feel anything before starting and even throughout the procedure. In no way did I feel intimidated by the procedure, throughout Dr Russell was very friendly and even joking with me to ease my anxiety. He was also very encouraging like I was a kid (not condescendingly or sarcastically, mind you) but you know what, it was actually what I needed to distract me from my fear and anxiety. Genuinely helped me.\n\nThank you Doctor Russell and the team for making me feel safe, comfortable and less fearful of the procedure!

Doctor issued false information repeatedly which would not have been corrected if I did not press the issue:\n\nAppalling experience with a doctor who repeatedly denied the existence of a tripartite advisory regarding medical records and job applications even though this clinic supposedly processes hundreds of pre-employment check-ups every week.

Some of his choice words included, \"Well I am the doctor here, so I think I should know better.\"\n\nIt turned out later that the advisory does exist. He did not even acknowledge his mistake, but instead continued to be even more rude.\n\n2. Multiple potential breaches of confidentiality:\nAfterwards, he also did not ask for my consent to have additional personnel present when another doctor walked in unannounced while we were discussion confidential matters about my medical history. Beyond that, he also instructed me to explain the situation myself to the admin staff outside, even though the clinic waiting room is a semi-public space and was packed full of members of the public at the time. (By the way I had to re-queue all over again for this)\n\n3. Doctor has unprofessional behavior:\nDoctor was rude and dismissive throughout our exchanges. Moreover, whenever I attempted to ask reasonable clarifying questions, he responded with clear impatience and disrespect.\n\nLater, upon complaining about this incident to my close friends, one of them shared that their knew of this doctor personally and showed their publicly-viewable instagram profile to me. There they openly brand themselves as a doctor + lifestyle influencer and their content is mostly half-naked photos of themselves.  I think this pretty much sums up how much seriousness and respect they have for the medical profession and what they prioritize over being competent. I don't know what kind of reputation the hospital is trying to uphold with employees like this.\n\n4. No response from Raffles Hospital\n\nI sent several complaints to the hospital over 2 weeks ago and have not even gotten a simple response acknowledging that they have received my feedback and are looking into the matter. This is very disappointing as doctors should not be distributing medical misinformation and breach of confidentiality is a serious issue.\n\nBecause of this I have reached out to MOM, MOH, TAFEP, and will consider further actions. Reading the reviews here, it is clear that many people have had horrible experiences at this clinic for a long time. What kind of clinic has \"humiliating\" as a tag under its reviews..\n\n5. Misc\n\nI would like to add that the rest of the medical and admin staff were quite professional, and many were trying their best even though they were clearly tired and unhappy. I appreciate their work, as the clinic has to process a really large amount of patients during peak periods.","review_date":"2024-09-20T07:27:10.766Z","category":"Retail"}

Dr Jan replied personally,  saying that (1) he had â€œvery little timeâ€ to read my feedback; and (2) they have a long waiting list and no vaccine stock. Dr Jan, in case it is not clear enough, the issue is the lack of follow up from your clinic on my request as promised - if there was no stock, you could have just informed me simply over the phone.

{"company_name":"Healthwerkz Medical Centre","stars":"3","text":"Bad attitude from Doctor Gerald Chong on Monday (8 May 2023).\n\nI went down on Saturday (6 May) with the intentions to get the basic $5 health screening check up (from Health Hub app). When I went to the clinic, both staff at the counter said that they were temp staff and are unable to access the portal to check whether I am eligible for the $5 health screening check up. I proceeded to show my Health Hub message that confirmed that I am eligible. However, they said only weekday staff can access the portal and told me to come back on a weekday to check.\n\nSo the following Monday (8 May), I went down and the permanent staff already checked with the doctor and system that I am eligible for the test. I said I would return on Saturday to do the test instead since I would need to fast for the screening too.\n\nHowever, the doctor on duty on Monday, Gerald Chong told me to come on a weekday instead because the temporary clinic staff on Saturday do not know how to submit the form for the health screening. He was rude and brushed me off and said there was no choice because the temp staff do not know the procedure and told me to go another clinic as he canâ€™t help. I asked if he could get the permanent staff to help with the form beforehand on a weekday before I get the health screening on a Saturday. However, he continued to brush me off and repeatedly said that I should just go to another clinic instead before walking back into the room without hearing my response.\n\nHis condescending tone and words rubbed me in the wrong way, especially when other staff and I have been communicating in a cordial manner before that. Asking people to just go to another clinic instead also feels like an irresponsible act. I will not ever visit this clinic again if Gerald Chong is on duty. In contrast, Doctor Goh is a friendly and knowledgable doctor at this clinic every time he is on duty.\n\nAdditionally, I do not understand why the clinic is even open on Saturday if the temp staff present on weekends have no experience and are unable to submit forms or other procedures,\n\nIn general, this clinic also refuses patients before their official closing time. For instance, the opening hours are stated as 6-9pm but they would already start refusing patients when itâ€™s only 8+pm and even when there are no patients inside waiting.","review_date":"2023-05-13T03:12:23.560Z","category":"Food & Beverage"}

This is a valid question, and I had my reasons which are super valid too. So, I answered. But she went on to say below things to me which I find very unprofessional and make the organization she is working for look SO BAD!\n1) she said I must make sure that I want to do braces, then only she will book doctor consultation for me (excuse me, do I need to sign the paper that says I will do braces no matter what even before I go in for the consultation?)\n\n2) ask me to imagine if every patient is like me who will book consultation but dont do braces later on. Told me that I am wasting doctor's time. (Excuse me! I am PAYING FOR MY CONSULATION. The doctor is not doing it for free.)\n\n3) I said if you don't want to accept my booking, you don't have to. I will just go to another clinic which she replied to me that every doctor will tell you the same thing, and this problem (of me not doing braces after consultation and wasting doctor's time) will follow no matter which clinic I go.\n\n4) (This is the worst part) She said their clinic isn't afraid to lose one customer. They can survive with one less customer.\n\nI had the shock of my life after talking to her on phone. This is not how you should treat your customer. I am paying for all your services. No one deserves to be treated like a second class just because I cancelled an appointment in the past and didn't proceed to do the braces after consultation.

{"company_name":"Nuffield Dental | Dentist @ Seletar","stars":"1","text":"I was a patient at Nuffield Dental Greenwich branch. The dentist who re-crown my incisor arranged an appointment for me at their Wheelock branch, ostensibly to choose a colour for my crown. When I went to Wheelock, the receptionist told me that no appointment has been made for me. As I was already there, I insisted to be attended to. A Malay/muslim lab technician came and we went through the selection. I chose a grade 3 but he brushed me aside and told me he will take a 3.5. I thought that he knew better and trusted him. During the session, I saw another Malay/Muslim man in another room laughing away. I dismissed it.\n\nThe dentist fixed the 3.5 crown and after some time, it sticks out like a sore thumb. I went back in July 2024 and insisted on changing it to 3. This time, the dentist brought the samples to the clinic. I chose the shade I had initially chosen- a 3.\n\nOn my return trip to fix a temporary crown, 2 chicken rice sellers at Greenwich foodcourt,  one male and the other female walked into the room. The male chicken rice seller stayed on to assist the dentist. I told them not to fixed a temporary crown that is too white as I have to wait another 14 days before I get the permanent crown. Instead they purposely fixed a temporary crown which was very very white. It is clear that the 2 of them was out to purposely to make a spectacle of me! At that time, the 2 chicken rice sellers were masked up and I thought that they were qualified nurses.\n\nWhen I send them the photo of the female chicken rice seller, the dentist immediately told me that the permanent crown is ready. And I can go back immediately to fix it.\n\nIt was over the weekend and I delivered 2 letters of complaint to the receptionist who was actually the male chicken rice seller.\n\nThe Director of operations met me on Monday, 25 July 2024, and I insisted he sat in. The dentist fixed the permanent crown and told me that it was glued with temporary cement. And if the crown loosens to go back and he will glue with permanent cement.\n\nThis dentist is obviously lying to me. In fact he had glued the permanent crown with permanent cement.\n\nAfter Nuffliedâ€™s refusal to settle the matter privately with me, I reported to the police and they investigated.\n\nI had a dispute with the Malay/Muslims in my previous condo and that was the reason why I moved house to Yio Chue Kang. But for a professional dentist to collude with them to ridicule me is very very unprofessional and a serious breach of professional conduct.\n\nI spent a total of about $3K including a splint. I will certainly lodge a complaint against the dentist.\n\nThe Receptionists also brings gossip into the office and breaches patient confidentiality.\n\nThe conduct of the clinic in allowing a chicken rice seller to assist a dentist is reprehensible and is a professional misconduct. I do not know the dentist nor any of the Muslim chicken  rice sellers at all.\n\nI will certainly lodge a formal complaint to the medical council against the dentist, Dr Robin Zhang.\n\nI have read their response and wish to add that there was no full and final settlement of the matter. I agree to accept the replaced crown as it is the colour shade I had chose but this doesnâ€™t excuse Dr Robin Zhang and Nuffieldâ€™s  misconduct in allowing untrained personnel to pose as lab technician and nurse to assist Dr Zhang in the treatment room. Their intention is to make a joke and a spectacle out of me!\n\nNow I recognised the female chicken rice stall holder- she is Lena who was the cleaner in my previous condo. She threw soiled tissue paper outside my opposite Arab neighbour unit which has caused serious disputes between my Arab neighbour and I. She also released a rat into my unit to force me to move out, not to mention threw dead birds into my patio/plastic and dead leaves into my patio in the days before I moved out. She and her lover (who was her supervisor) were asked to leave. She followed me here to take revenge.\n\nI am surprised a dentist like Dr Zhang would see fit to further her personal vendetta.","review_date":"2025-08-18T10:04:37.427Z","category":"Arts"}

Despite my agony, his voice gave me a sense of calm as he went through my health condition step by step and gave his views on the current meds I was taking (for other health conditions) so as to narrow down what was wrong with me. As I had already taken different types of painkillers from Buscopan to Arcoxia to Cellebrex to relieve the pain, I was concerned with OD. I think he managed to pin point the cause and advised me accordingly over the phone on what further meds I can or cannot take to avoid overdosing. Upon taking his medical advice, my pain subsided significantly. I know there are good doctors out there but Dr Chua is one hellavu doctor.

Understand that the particular patient was suspected to have a heart attack. Working in the healthcare industry, I can fully comprehend the urgency of the situation, however, i cannot understand why the clinic has to be closed immediately, ditching the other patients who have been already registered.

After seeing doctor at the clinic, awhile later i was call to make payment & to clinic my medications. When the receptionist showed me the medicine's i realized that one of the medicine i got it at my home. So i told them i think i don't need this practical medicine as i have already got it. And the doctor came out from his room and told me \"If you know that you have this medicine, u could have told me earlier right, now my manpower has been wasted.\" I replied to him saying that as as patient i only know that u are providing me with medicine. How will i know what medicine, how does the medicine even look like? This doctor is so ridiculous, his not professional for his work. My question here is, how will a patient know what medicine is the doctor going to provide? Until we are going to make the payment that's where we will look through the medications. How am i to tell him in advance that i dont need the medicine. And also i have went to so many clinics in Singapore, never once i have encountered a situation like this. No clinics have rejected our request when we tell them that we already have this medicine with us, so i dont need this now. All i know is they will take the medication from us and only charge us for the rest of the medicine they provide. Payment wise, this is not acceptable. I have ever paid consultation fee of $16 at other clinics. And their medicine will be strong & i will recover. This clinic here only knows how to charge us the consultation fee but their job wise they are not professionals.

It was informed that Dr Kayla's previous appointment had overrun.\nWhen I made the appointment, I informed that I would like to do fillings, cleaning, and a consultation regarding braces. However, during the session, Dr Kayla focused mainly on recommending braces and only performed one filling, even though I had informed that other services would be required. When I asked if we could complete the second filling during this visit and I do not mind postponing the cleaning to next session, Dr Kayla stated there was not enough time, which was surprising to me. I have never been to a dentist appointment that only allows for one filling, especially when I make the appointment, I had already informed that I would need to do multiple services, and nothing was informed to me that this would not be possible. I also canâ€™t help thinking that if her previous appointment overruns, she should not compromise my appointment.\nAfter the first appointment, I scheduled a follow-up session for the second filling, cleaning and braces consultation. The receptionist confirmed with me again that I would be able to perform all these services in one session. In addition, to be able to schedule an appointment fast, I was recommended to schedule an afternoon session in which I did. I then took leave to come for my second appointment.\nHowever, when I arrived for the second appointment, I was told that the appointment had not been booked. It was also informed that the clinic does not send text or whatsapp reminders and they only confirm appointments via phone calls. So, moving forward, if I miss their call, I wonâ€™t be able to verify that the appointment was made unless I call them every time before I go.\nThis entire experience left me feeling as though my time was not valued. It seems that only the dentist's time is considered important. I had to take time off work for an afternoon appointment, and this lack of organization and lack of respect for my time really caused unnecessary inconvenience. If you are looking for a clinic that values your time and provides efficient service, I would definitely not recommend this clinic.","review_date":"2024-11-28T08:02:41.673Z","category":"Retail"}

As I was really worried for my son's condition, I desperately explained our situation and begged them to take us in, assuring that we will be fast. The nurse empathised with us and helped to check with Dr Ong. However, she turned us down on both tries, without even looking at my son's face or checking his temperature.\nI understand that we were late and that she would definitely have to work overtime if she had agreed to see us.

Furthermore, medication was prescribed immediately, seemingly based on incomplete and random results, without a comprehensive evaluation.\n\nI found this approach unprofessional and concerning, as it did not demonstrate the thoroughness and patient-centered care that should be expected in a clinical setting.

The following day, I came back at 11:45 AM, when the clinic was supposed to be open until 1:00 PM, and once again, I was rejected.\n\nAs a neighborhood clinic, it should be expected that patient volume may increase, especially given the rise in COVID cases. COVID aside, if the clinic refuses to see patients until the posted closing time, then it is misleading and unacceptable. If the policy is to stop accepting patients well before closing, that should be clearly communicatedâ€”either on the website or through a prominent notice that registration closes at least an hour before closing time.\n\nBeing turned away twice after arriving well before closing is completely unacceptable, especially for those seeking urgent care. The nurses, who seemed eager to close the doors early, only added to the frustration. This is not how a healthcare facility should operate, especially in a community where it may be the only option for many.\n\nAfter reading other reviews, itâ€™s clear that this clinic has a reputation for rejecting seriously ill patients. I strongly urge you to reconsider your operational practices and address this issue immediately.

{"company_name":"Tan & Nah Family Clinic","stars":"1","text":"My family, friends, and I have always trusted this clinic because of Dr Shawnâ€™s consistently respectful and professional care. However, my recent experience with a locum (relief) doctor on Monday, 14 July 2025, as the final patient of the evening, was deeply disappointing and unprofessional.\n\nAs a 20-year-old female attending alone, I expected empathy and professionalism. Instead, I was met with a flippant, dismissive attitude. The doctor grinned, laughed, chuckled, and giggled throughout the consultation, as if my concerns were entertaining. I felt mocked and treated like a clown, not a patient. I doubt he wouldâ€™ve acted this way if I had been accompanied by my parents.\n\nI presented with throat irritation, phlegm, ticklish and runny nose, and fever (prior to paracetamol taken over the last 2 days), and more. I was repeatedly told it was â€œjust a cold.â€ Whether or not medically true, the tone was belittling. I made it clear Iâ€™d been taking paracetamol for 2 days, yet he brushed off the fever history with â€œno fever now means no influenza,â€ ignoring that paracetamol masks symptoms. He even claimed â€œparacetamol isnâ€™t to reduce feverâ€, and insisted itâ€™s just to â€œmake you feel better.â€ I was stunned to hear such misinformation from a licensed doctor.\n\nI tried to share recent overseas travel to Thailand, but he showed no interest. No follow-up questions. When I asked what was being prescribed, he didnâ€™t explain, just vaguely pointed to the counter and told me to ask the staff. This lack of clarity made me uncomfortable.\n\nThe throat check (shining light) lasted under 1 second. I have photos showing irritation and redness. When I raised concerns about my tonsils, he dismissed it saying, â€œIâ€™ve seen thousands of tonsils, I know okâ€ He didnâ€™t ask about my phlegm. I had to literally state that it was yellow and white, which was met with amusement again. (As of 15 July, brown phlegm is also observed, photo available)\n\nEven more disturbing was how he mocked the fact that I had written my symptoms in my Notes app, something I do at every doctorâ€™s visit to stay organised. He saw it and repeatedly made degrading remarks like, â€œYou wrote so much, so you should know,â€ and â€œIf you research so much, you should know a virus doesnâ€™t just go away.â€ I clarified it was a personal log, yet he kept chuckling. It was condescending and appalling.\n\nThe consultation felt rushed and disrespectful. Yes, I was the last patient, but that doesnâ€™t excuse the impatience, interruptions or mocking tone. He seemed eager to end the session quickly, offering no reassurance, explanation, or guidance.\n\nAfter brushing everything off as â€œjust a cold,â€ he used multiple pumps of hand sanitiser for himself but said nothing about what I should do. No mention of wearing a mask, isolating, distancing, or how long to take precautions. I live around vulnerable elderly. Basic advice should have been a given. His concern for his own hygiene stood in stark contrast to the lack of care shown toward a symptomatic patient.\n\nThis was, without exaggeration, the worst doctor experience Iâ€™ve had in any clinic, polyclinic, or hospital, local or overseas. It was worlds apart from the professionalism Dr Shawn consistently upholds. I left feeling humiliated, unheard, and uncertain about the quality of care I received.\n\nOut of legal consideration, I will not name the doctor here, but I will share his name directly with Dr Shawn if requested.\n\nI am not surprised to see that other patients such as, lin thant kant and vexel have both left bad Google reviews 2 weeks ago and 1 year ago respectively describing a poor experience with this locum doctor.\n\nI will be making a formal complaint to the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) regarding the locum doctorâ€™s poor conduct.\n\nI will also be sharing my experience with all my friends and family so they are made aware of the standard of care.\n\nThis review is written honestly, in good faith, based on my experience. It is not to defame, but to raise awareness and protect future patients. Respect, communication, and professionalism should never be optional.","review_date":"2025-07-15T11:47:30.484Z","category":"Arts"}

There were three of them,  two girls and one guy and they were giggling in a way that made me feel mocked. I distinctly heard the guy say â€œhelp me can I ps leh,â€ which felt directed me. Immediately after, one of the girls laughed and said â€œno, you do it,â€ and the guy then proceeded to call out my name and explained the medicine loudly, saying: â€œIf you feel ITCH down there you can apply the cream.â€\n\nThis was extremely rude and unprofessional. First, I had already told the doctor that I did not have any itchiness, so his comment felt dismissive. More importantly, this is a private and sensitive medical issue, and it should have been handled discreetly. Instead, I felt like a clown being laughed at in front of others.\n\nMedical visits should make patients feel safe, respected, and taken seriously.

So we book the next day appointment to come down for the HPV test with a female doctor.\n2) The next day,  we came down to the clinic, and the blood test report came out and we can at the same time reviewed by the doctor. The female doctor told us that after seeing the blood test result, my wife need to take the cholesterol medication, which we already inform the doctor that previously my wife had already taken the medicine before, but the doctor told us its necessary to take another blood test to check the liver before to confirm taking the cholesterol medicine. And it will cost $30 for the check. As we think that maybe it's necessary, we agree with the female doctor and do the blood test! the blood test was taken at the back of the.hand, and after taking the blood sample, pulling out the needle, the doctor told us that maybe the blood samples taken out was not enough, may need to take somemore, which mean to poke 1 more time. I advise the doctor to just submit the taken blood samples for test first to see if it's enough or not, then the doctor agreed. \"I dont think this procedure is professional as my wife was a bit traumatised by the doctor saying of may be poking again to collect blood\"\n**Part1/2","review_date":"2025-08-17T05:38:25.059Z","category":"education"}

{"company_name":"PLATINUM MEDICAL CENTRE PTE LTD","stars":"1","text":"Visited this clinic, hoping to have a straightforward blood test done for a health screening, but was incredibly disappointed by the experience. FIRSTLY, this wasnâ€™t even my first time here, I came last week for the same blood test and despite poking my arm and wrist several times, they said my vein was too small and I was asked to come another day. (Which is today) AND TODAY, same shit again. Whatâ€™s worst is, the doctor is the one doing the blood test for me. Isnâ€™t this just a very BASIC procedure? If they AT LEAST apologised for it, I wouldnâ€™t be so pissed off. But instead of apologising for it they were constantly citing various reasons like oh my vein were small, I didnâ€™t drink enough water etc, does that mean everyone with small veins have to be poke countless times for a BASIC blood test?  If youâ€™re looking for a clinic where even simple medical tests can be done, this is not the place to go. I wonâ€™t be returning and would suggest looking elsewhere for more reliable care.","review_date":"2024-12-13T02:26:43.158Z","category":"retail"}

Since itâ€™s difficult to get her to open her mouth during consultations, I took a photo beforehand to show the doctor for better clarity.\n\nHowever, when I tried to show him the picture, he refused to look at it, saying, â€œThe patient is here, I can see for myself.â€ I asked if she had HFMD, and he immediately dismissed it, saying, â€œParents like to scare themselves with HFMD.â€ When I asked if it was an ulcer on her tongue, he said no, but when I pressed further and asked for a diagnosis, he only replied, â€œMust be something else,â€ without giving any clear explanation. Despite this vague assessment, he still prescribed medication and issued a bill for $77.\n\nThe next day, my daughterâ€™s condition worsened, and she refused to eat for two days straight. I brought her to another doctor and it turns out I was right. She did have HFMD and mouth ulcers. The second doctor confirmed the diagnosis and even told me to disregard the medication prescribed by the first doctor because it wasnâ€™t appropriate. He also explained that HFMD can sometimes only present in the mouth, without showing on hands or feet.\n\nI donâ€™t mind waiting, and I donâ€™t mind paying for proper medical care. But the least that should be done is to listen to our concerns and make a proper effort to diagnose a child. This is not just any patient, itâ€™s a small child who canâ€™t express their symptoms clearly.\n\nIf anything had happened to my daughter due to the missed diagnosis and dismissive attitude during that 2-minute consultation, the responsibility would have been on you. As a parent, I expect at the very minimum basic communication, attention, and care, especially when dealing with young children.","review_date":"2025-08-04T23:52:18.229Z","category":"Arts"}

The staff over the phone mentioned that the cost is only $9 with a Pioneer Card, and that I can bring my family member down ANYTIME of the day.\n\nHeaded down with the elderly family member and had the jab at estimated 1820 hrs, the locum doctor gave the jab. Afterwards when we were due for payment, the staff member - a malay lady told us that the final bill is $40. We were confused and asked why the price was so high and not what was previously quoted with a pioneer card.\n\nThe lady then told us the time slot we have was under a locum doctor. Hence, the $9 offer could not be valid. In addition, she mentioned that she was not around to prevent the locum doctor from giving the jab as the offer would not be valid. The junior staff - a chinese lady was unsure about the protocols as to how the $9 offer goes about.\n\nIf so, why did the caller tell me that I could come ANYTIME.\n\nEdit: Updated as of 17/02/25.

{"company_name":"Yio Chu Kang MRT Clinic","stars":"1","text":"This was my first and definitely last visit to this clinic. As echoed by most other reviews, I found Dr. Terence Koh to be unprofessional, dismissive, rude and lacking basic empathy.\n\nI visited the clinic on 7 August shortly after moving to Yio Chu Kang and had one of the worst clinic experiences Iâ€™ve ever encountered. Upon entering the consultation room, the doctor asked about my condition. As I began explaining, he abruptly stopped me and asked for the queue number chip, which my husband was holding outside. When I mentioned that, he asked me why was it outside and requested that I leave the room to retrieve it â€” over a queue chip that couldâ€™ve easily been returned to the receptionist afterwards.\n\nAs I described my symptoms, including vomiting the night before and again that morning, he maintained a constant frown and asked when I had last experienced these issues. I shared that I had consulted a specialist in 2023 for suspected vertigo, though no resolution was found and this seems like a recurring problem. His response? A dismissive â€œYou feel dizzy every day ah?â€ â€” a question that felt belittling rather than medically constructive.\n\nThe examination was equally questionable. He palpated my stomach and casually concluded, â€œNo wind, canâ€™t beâ€ then asked me to follow his finger with my eyes. Afterwards, he remarked, â€œdo you feel dizzy, no right?â€ â€” as if that alone could rule out my symptoms. Since when following a finger will make you dizzy?\n\nThere were no other patients at the clinic during my visit which, in hindsight, may say something. Itâ€™s hard to believe the few positive reviews here arenâ€™t written by friends or family.\n\nSo please, if youâ€™re searching for a neighbourhood clinic, look elsewhere.","review_date":"2025-08-07T09:23:36.833Z","category":"food and beverages"}

Iâ€™m just having a headache, booked the queue at around 7am but being cut queue cos physical queue takes priority. I just want to get this over and sleep, not look at the app all the time. Urge everyone to queue physically, den you can really rest. Why is there even a 117.1 number from initial 117? Is that how my queue doesnâ€™t decrease? Queued (via app) at 7am, message sent at 11.30pm, Iâ€™m the 2nd last patient that the doctor see, still waiting to collect medication at 1.20pm.","review_date":"2024-09-09T04:56:36.786Z","category":"Retail"}

( I am a lazy person in general but this is the one time i actually feel like i just had to )\n\nI had an appointment at the sports & medicine clinic for this knee pain that has been bugging me for quite some time now but was somewhat tolerable (about time i get it checked up), and whilst waiting for my queue number to get called, i was quite nerve-wrecked to be very honest as i did not really know what to expect - bad news or worse, a Doctor who could care less about me (i am just a socially awkward person).\n\nBut all that worry immediately vanished after i met a godsend otherwise known as Dr Teoh Chin Sim. Right from the get go, i knew i was in good hands, from the charismatic way she assessed my condition and potrayed herself, i was able to fully express the discomfort in my knee i was facing, and could feel that Dr Teoh was on the same page as i was. It was like explaining my knee pain to a friend who cared (Even sharing some similarities as I before have undergone surgery by person A from KTPH whom is actually the HOD of Dr Teo. It genuinely amused me to see how everything felt interconnected.)\n\nAt last, i learnt that i actually had a common injury called a Jumper's Knee, which was proven by an ultrasound that Dr Teoh had expertly done on my knee, showcasing to me along the way the differences between a healthy and unhealthy tendon, etc and the different treatment plans for it. Additionally i learnt that Admiralty Medical Centre is actually under KTPH.\n\nOverall, i am really glad with how things went, I thought it was just gonna be another one of those consultation which does not tell me anything and feel like a waste of money.\n\ntldr: those who are visiting Dr Teoh Chin Sim, you are in good hands :D","review_date":"2025-05-22T18:27:25.837Z","category":"Arts"}

The clinic had called me earlier today to move my appointment earlier, and I agreed. During the consultation, when the dentist asked my son if he wanted to extract his tooth or not â€” in a blunt, impatient tone â€” saying you want to do or not! he then added that we were already â€œlate,â€ despite the clinic being the one who had moved the appointment and we were on time.\n\nFrom the start, his manner was unfriendly and dismissive. He used a snide, sarcastic tone, completely inappropriate statements and improper annotations to say to a parent in front of a child. Instead of explaining the procedure, offering reassurance, or coaxing a child (as any competent childrenâ€™s dentist should), he made him feel pressured and frightened. I was so appalled I decided to walk out halfway through the consultation.\n\nSuch behaviour is unethical, unprofessional, and unacceptable, especially for someone working with children. While you continue practising dentistry, may I suggest you also practise your manners as a professional. Such lousy service should never be tolerated. Parents and children deserve kindness, respect, and proper care, not rudeness and indifference.

It was truly a culture shock for me this was the first time Iâ€™ve encountered a medical professional so rude and dismissive. It was genuinely a huge culture shock for me.\n\nI brought my elderly grandmother in for a consultation, hoping for basic respect and attentiveness, but unfortunately, we were met with the opposite. As another reviewer rightly pointed out, his tone was harsh and completely lacking in warmth or empathy. He seemed disinterested throughout, brushing off our questions and speaking to my granny in a way that was unnecessarily curt and disrespectful.\n\nIt was clear to both of us that he had no intention of engaging with care or patience. My grandmother left the clinic feeling dismissed and demoralized, and we both wholeheartedly agreed that the way he treated her was unkind and unprofessional.\n\nI understand that not every patient-doctor interaction will be warm and fuzzy, but basic decency and respect should never be compromised especially when dealing with elderly patients. This experience has left a lasting negative impression, and I would not recommend him based on our visit.","review_date":"2025-07-30T10:01:05.344Z","category":"education"}

The service attitude at the counter was not good. The doctor dismissed me in less than 5 minutes and i have ask isit HFMD or what n he just said I just had common folliculitis and prescribed steroids. I went home and applied it once, and I felt very uncomfortable. And the red spots kept increasing. What was even more strange was that I said I didn't have a cough or nasal congestion, but he prescribed me a cough and nasal congestion solution. He didn't give me any antipruritic medicine, antipyretic medicine, antibiotics, etc. After two days, it became more and more serious. I went to another clinic and was diagnosed with chickenpox! I also showed the second doctor the prescription given by my first doctor. The second doctor said that steroids cannot be applied to chickenpox because it will reduce our immunity and the chickenpox will increase. This is why my fever keeps coming back. In short, this is a very unprofessional and careless clinic. I advise everyone not to go here if you have serious cases.

Had similar symptoms 2-3 weeks back and was prescribed certain medications which I had informed him of. Dr Sam Wong insisted it was not bacterial infection, but a viral one. But I clarified I have no cough, flu, blocked nose (after his attempt to suggest itâ€™s viral), and then he proceeded to suggest itâ€™s acid reflux? And asked if I eat spicy food, sour food, etc - to which I replied NO for all the above. He then asked if I wear contacts and I said no.\n\nAfter having multiple â€œnoâ€s to probes that align with his insistence that itâ€™s viral infection, he then said he can provide antibiotics but he doesnâ€™t think it will work. Just to clarify - I did not ask for antibiotics to be prescribed I just noted that I took it previously when I had the same symptoms 2/3 wks ago. Here, I would like to ask, whatâ€™s the point of his diagnosis when all questions are asked to feed his inherent assumptions and his reluctance to provide a medication which he thinks wouldnâ€™t even work?!\n\nHe then also added on that my previous set of eye drops contain antibiotics and that my eye infection is because of allergy. Well I guess  I can suddenly develop allergies that I do not know of. But he proceeded to probe if itâ€™s painful when I already said no, thereâ€™s no feeling itâ€™s just red! And he wouldnâ€™t explain why he thinks itâ€™s allergy as well, just â€œitâ€™s allergyâ€ x2\n\nI believe that his certification to be a family doctor goes beyond being assuming.\n\nMedication I got at check out:\n- Antibiotics (reluctantly given out)\n- Allergy eye drops\n\nWell and I thought that I will be getting a sore throat medicine that aligns with his supposed diagnosis but no! I donâ€™t expect every doctor to diagnose patients perfectly due to subjectivity and reactivity, but there was literally no diagnosis. He just gave me what I had 2/3 weeks ago, the thing he said wouldnâ€™t work.\n\nManagement needs to review his suitability as a family doctor for reputational and business competency.

{"company_name":"Northeast Medical Group (Sengkang Clinic)","stars":"1","text":"I had a very disappointing experience during my recent visit to Northeast Clinic with Dr. Wong. I shared that I had been coughing for more than two weeks and was beginning to experience mild breathing difficulties. However, Dr. Wong quickly dismissed my concerns and insisted it was acid reflux, stating that â€œa cough canâ€™t last so long.â€ He didnâ€™t seem interested in exploring other possibilities or asking further questions.\n\nInstead, he immediately started advising me to avoid tea, coffee, spicy, and oily food. Then, without any basis, he asked, â€œYou smoke, right?â€ When I replied no, he completely ignored my answer and continued telling me to quit smoking. He then asked if I drank alcohol. Again, I said no, but he brushed past that and told me to stop drinking. He finished by saying, â€œMost importantly, you must lose weight â€” once youâ€™re slim, everything will be okay.â€\n\nI was appalled by this dismissive and presumptive approach. I left the clinic feeling unheard and disrespected. A doctor should listen, ask questions, and consider the patientâ€™s input â€” not make assumptions or offer one-size-fits-all advice without proper diagnosis. I hope the clinic takes this feedback seriously to ensure better care for future patients.","review_date":"2025-05-26T07:30:04.347Z","category":"Retail"}

However, the consultation we received fell drastically short of acceptable medical standards. The entire appointment lasted less than one minute, during which Dr. Wong displayed a concerning lack of thoroughness and empathy.\n\nDespite us clearly and repeatedly explaining that my partner had been experiencing persistent back pain and body aches that were unresponsive to over-the-counter painkillers, Dr. Wong dismissed our concerns. He neither conducted a physical examination nor attempted to assess the affected areas. Instead, he insisted that it was nothing serious and continued to suggest the same painkillers, offering no alternative diagnosis or further investigation.\n\nAdditionally, for the fever, no proper treatment plan was discussed. My partner was advised merely to rest. He exhibited no respiratory symptoms (such as coughing or a sore throat), yet was prescribed medication that appeared unrelated to his condition, raising questions about the relevance and necessity of the prescriptions. More concerningly, no antibiotics were prescribed, nor were any referrals suggested.\n\nThe entire consultation felt rushed, impersonal, and dismissive. It did not meet even the most basic expectations of a medical check-up, let alone a professional evaluation tailored to the patientâ€™s reported symptoms.\n\nReading the reviews, this is not the first time that there were complaints regarding Dr. Wongâ€™s conduct and approach toward patients. It is deeply troubling that despite such recurring feedback, there appears to be little accountability or corrective action taken. A doctorâ€™s attitude and attentiveness can significantly impact a patientâ€™s health and well-being, and in this case, we left the clinic feeling frustrated, unheard, and concerned for the quality of care being provided to others.\n\nI sincerely hope this complaint will be taken seriously. I urge the clinic to conduct a thorough review of this incident and consider implementing improved protocols to ensure that all patients receive respectful, attentive, and competent care.","review_date":"2025-05-24T06:30:57.175Z","category":"food and beverages"}

What I witnessed from the medical staff was highly unprofessional and not what patients should be exposed to when seeking care.\n\n1. Poor coordination â€“ Multiple doctors and nurses asked the same questions and repeated the same checks, showing confusion and lack of communication.\n\n2. Overpowering scents â€“ Several staff were heavily doused in perfume/cologne to the point it was unbearable and even gave me a headache. This is inappropriate in a clinical environment.\n\n3. Compromised hygiene â€“ Nurses were seen sitting on empty patient beds. This raised serious concerns about cleanliness and sterility.\n\n4. Unprofessional behaviour â€“ A doctor and several nurses were being overly casual and playful with each other during duty hours. Their conduct did not reflect the professionalism expected in a hospital setting.\n\n5. Noise and disruption â€“ Staff were laughing and talking loudly in the early morning hours, disturbing patients who were unwell and trying to rest.\n\nThe overall atmosphere felt less like a hospital ward and more like a social gathering, which was shocking and disappointing.

When I had a really bad eye infection, I had already been to two clinics and even a hospital, but nothing helped. It was only after seeing Dr. Tan and following his recommendation to an eye specialist that things finally got better. That experience alone won me over completely.\n\nHe also recommended a fantastic gynae, and since then, Iâ€™ve stuck with him for everything. Heâ€™s attentive, sincere, and never makes you feel rushed. My toddler, whoâ€™s usually very shy around doctors, actually warms up to him, and even asked him for stickers which says a lot!\n\nItâ€™s rare to find someone whoâ€™s not just skilled, but genuinely cares. Dr. Tanâ€™s now our go-to doctor, and I honestly donâ€™t see that changing anytime soon.","review_date":"2025-04-16T06:24:48.127Z","category":"education"}

During my recent visit, I was turned away because the medical insurance portal was down. The reception staff simply advised me to â€œcome back later,â€ without offering a specific timeframe or any form of follow-up. A more helpful approach could have been to offer a call-back once the system was restored.\n\nOn previous visits, when my insurance e-card failed to load, the receptionists did not attempt to verify my details or check the system manually.

In those situations, I paid out-of-pocket and filed a claim later due to the urgency of my condition.\n\nWhat Iâ€™ve consistently observed is a lack of empathy and initiative from the reception team.

The doctor did dengue blood test for me due to red rashes throughout the body although I did not have body ache or fever, as the doctor claimed that some dengue patients could only have red rashes as a symptom. Can only review result 2-3 days later at the clinic and settle payment on the spot, but the staff took 5-10min to confirm that after I checked with them at the counter, as the waiting time was pointless and wasting my time. I found the red rashes doubled up today morning and quickly consulted at virtual clinic. The doctor diagnosed its hives by seeing the red rashes disappeared for a moment after I pressed on it. And Meds and cream are otw to my home. In short, visiting this clinic may lead to seeing inexperienced doctor and staff, wasting money for doing unnecessary test.

{"company_name":"Northland Family Clinic & Surgery","stars":"1","text":"I have been to this clinic multiple times, and I have to commend Dr. Lee Hwee Ming for being a helpful and patient doctor. However, I must address a concerning issue regarding the elderly receptionist at the front desk. During my previous visits, despite her somewhat unprofessional manner of speaking, I chose to overlook it to avoid causing any trouble. However, during my two most recent visits, I found that her attitude became increasingly bothersome.\n\nThe clinic's posted consultation hours are from 8:30 am to 12:30 pm and from 2:30 pm to 6:00 pm. Last week, when I called and was informed that they accepted the last patient at 5:30 pm, I ensured to arrive within that timeframe out of respect. Yet, upon my arrival, I was scolded for arriving \"late\". I explained my work commitments and confirmed the last acceptance time with them beforehand, but she kept on lecturing and told me â€œYou couldâ€™ve just come earlierâ€, as it could affect their closing time and caused them to leave later. She added on saying that the doctor actually did not want to see me since I was â€œlateâ€.\n\nSo, today, I made an effort to arrive earlier around 5:15 pm since leaving work earlier wasn't feasible. But guess what? Still got an earful for being 'late.' I was like, seriously? She went on about how we shouldn't wait until the last hour, and this led me to question why the consultation hours are showing 6:00 pm if arriving at 5:15 pm was deemed late. When I asked if the morning hours were until 12:30 pm, she shut that down too, saying I should've been even earlier than 12pm, and just apply leave and come in the morning. Throughout the conversation, her tone remained rude, demanding, and unprofessional, which was incredibly frustrating.\n\nHonestly, the clinic should just revise their hours to 12 pm and 5 pm if that's what the receptionist wants. And they seriously need to address her attitude. I saw similar complaints in other Google reviews, and it's not a good look for the clinic, deterring regular patients like me from returning.","review_date":"2024-03-27T13:30:02.838Z","category":"Arts"}

The receptionist was friendly, speaking both English and Chinese, but there was a brief miscommunication where either of us misheard each other for COVID-19 symptoms (I think she asked, \"Show symptoms?\" while I heard \"No symptoms?\"). Overall, she was humble and kind.\n\nThe miscommunication meant that I was assigned to enter Room 2, reserved for COVID-19 patients. The doctor asked me about my symptoms when I clarified I was there for a migraine and needed painkillers, not a swab test. Nevertheless, he was quick to serve me.\n\nI wouldn't call him rude or insensitive, I've experienced worse. He was curt, asking questions, and then it was over in less than 3 minutes. I requested an MC for 1 day to rest and he gave it without question.\n\nDocking 1 star because of a surprise addition to the prescribed medication. I think now I understand what other patients complained about.

Imagine i am 64 person behind it got cleared in 20mins, not bad for a charity organisation\n\nHere is why i gave 3 stars.\n\nYou need to do your due diligence online reading reviews, who you should be seeing. The 1st guy i seen was extremely rude and obnoxious and not very attentive to what you say making you repeat multiple times  i was in a room with plenty of acupuncuture patients and while sharing experiences we all confirm that same guy being rude, obnoxious and unprofessional, despite being probono.

Mr. How Sek Kwong is especially professional, never fails to answer your queries patiently and pretty good with acupuncture as per photo. Some reviews are saying he is very good with medicine and general consultation too.\n\nThey dont allow collection of medicine and general consultation together with acupuncture now so this means you may see a different physician for your illness in dispensing the meds. I really am not quite sure how this would be more time saving or efficient.

{"company_name":"Lifeline Medical Group Sengkang","stars":"1","text":"I am writing to formally lodge a complaint about the unprofessional and inconsiderate behavior of two nurses at Lifeline Medical Group in Sengkang during my motherâ€™s visit to your clinic on 19th August. My mother, who was suffering from a high fever and was visibly weak, visited your clinic alone seeking medical attention. Unfortunately, the treatment she received from your nursing staff was deeply disappointing and far below the standard of care expected from a healthcare provider.\nUpon arriving at the clinic, my mother requested a face mask, likely due to her condition and to ensure the safety of others. Instead of assisting her with empathy or offering a solution, the nurses at the counter informed her that masks were not provided for free. They instructed her to leave the clinic, search for a mask elsewhere, and return for her consultation. This response was not only dismissive but also highly inconsiderate, given her weakened state and urgent need for medical attention. Forcing a sick patient to leave the premises to obtain a mask, without any offer of assistance or alternative, is unacceptable and contrary to the principles of compassionate healthcare.\nAs healthcare professionals, your nursing staff are expected to uphold a duty of care, showing kindness and understanding to patients, especially those who are vulnerable. The behavior exhibited by these nurses was rude, lacked empathy, and failed to reflect the values of Lifeline Medical Group as a trusted healthcare provider in our community. This incident left my mother feeling humiliated and neglected, which is deeply disheartening.\nI urge Lifeline Medical Group to investigate this matter thoroughly and take appropriate disciplinary action to address the conduct of the involved staff members. Additionally, I recommend that your clinic implement measures, such as staff training on patient care and empathy, to prevent such incidents from recurring. Ensuring that all patients are treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their circumstances, should be a priority for your organization.","review_date":"2025-08-19T15:47:58.935Z","category":"education"}

Instead of responding with understanding, she reacted with visible frustration and said, â€œWhy didnâ€™t you say earlier? Now I have to key in everything again.â€ I explained that I wasnâ€™t aware of the process, and that in other clinics, the staff would usually ask if itâ€™s a corporate visit. Thatâ€™s why I mentioned it before making any payment.\nThroughout the process, both nurses continued to speak in an angry tone in Chinese, which made me feel uncomfortable and disrespected.\nAfter they completed everything, they did not even inform me that the transaction was settled and that I had nothing to pay. I stood there awkwardly passing her my card for payment, unsure if I could leave, and had to ask twice if everything was done. One of the nurses finally responded in a curt and irritated tone, saying, â€œYes, done already. No need to pay.â€ Her tone was uncalled for and left me feeling embarrassed and unwelcome.\nI believe that patients especially first-time visitors should be treated with patience, professionalism, and respect.

Seeking immediate medical attention, he came to your clinic for help.\n\nFor the past 20 years, our family has trusted your clinic and relied on your services whenever we were in need of medical care. We have always appreciated the care provided by your team, especially given that all of your staff are senior professionals whom we have seen for many years. However, on this occasion, we were deeply disappointed by the lack of care and attention shown.\n\nDespite your clinic not having the necessary facilities for stitching, basic care and compassion could have been offered. Instead of providing any assistance, such as covering the wound to prevent infection, or even guiding him to the nearest hospital, your staff allowed him to leave without any proper wound care. He was left to travel to the hospital on his own, which is not only unacceptable but also concerning given his condition.\n\nIt is crucial to highlight that if infection had set in during his journey, it could have led to severe complications. As a healthcare facility, I expected a minimum level of care, such as first aid, to help stabilize the situation until he could receive proper treatment.\n\nGiven our long-standing relationship with your clinic, and the fact that weâ€™ve always had confidence in the senior staff, this experience was deeply disheartening. The lack of support left my father vulnerable to further harm and demonstrates a worrying disregard for patient safety.

I mentioned to the staff that I was in a rush when checking in and had an appointment at 11.10am, and I even checked if the waiting time for a blood test would be long because I would have come back another day if so. The staff told me for blood test it should be fine since most people were here for a full health checkup. I also know that itâ€™s a quick procedure so decided to wait.\n\nI had to wait over an hour for a simple blood test that was over in less than 5 mins, and I had to go up to the front desk multiple times to check on the status on my appointment. I wouldnâ€™t have been so frustrated if I had just been told to expect a long waiting time - to make it worse, the front desk staff communicated to each other in Chinese (within full earshot of all customers btw) that because Iâ€™m not seeing a doctor and just doing a blood test, thatâ€™s why my number got de-prioritized and I â€œshouldâ€™ve come early to draw bloodâ€. I appreciate that one of two of them was trying to expedite things for me, but it was really frustrating and annoying.\n\nJust some simple communication wouldâ€™ve change the experience entirely.

Dr. Siva talked a lot on how he doesn't know insurance and what to claim and suggest that I go hand surgeon... He did not tell me if he's going to prescribe me anything to treat the pain or diagnose what my issue is.  He just referred me to a hand surgeon.\n\nWhen I asked who he suggest I can see, he said the panel on my insurance doctor. I told him, can he give me some recommended surgeons so I can check if they are on my insurance panel.... He then asked me to wait, I waited for 10mins and he brought another doctor in to explain and who assured me that he will recommend me a doctor and advised me to check if they are in my insurance panel. That was exactly what I had asked for!!\n\nTo my shock and horror, Dr. Siva then charged me EXTENDED consult WITHOUT informing me. I only realized it when I paid.\n\nMaybe he knew I was claiming, it is very irresponsible that he told me to wait in the room and then charged me extra for long time WITHOUT informing.\n\nI will not pursue this as I am claiming this from travel insurance but I have to provide this feedback.

{"company_name":"Bridgepoint Health (Everton Park Clinic)","stars":"3","text":"This is a great clinic that I found in my neighbourhood recently. The doctors are good, and it has a seamless online booking system. Having said that, its queue management process has a big room for improvement, hence I only put 3 stars.\n\nI made an appointment and was at the clinic yesterday, yet the queue was 45 minutes long before it was my toddler's turn. Because she was unwell, she became tireless and was crying non stop after the long wait. It was unnecessarily stressful for me onsite as a parent.\n\nToday, I headed down to the clinic as I was also not feeling well myself. Despite that I made a booking on the system for 4.15pm slot, made an effort to be punctual, the nurse registered me and confirmed that I am the next one to go in .... I was unexpectedly stopped to go in at the last minute. This was because a man appeared at the counter after me to register himself, and the nurse said he should go in first as his booking was 4pm which was before mine (4.15pm).\n\nThis is the part that buffles me. The previous patient was late for his reserved time slot, and I made an effort to be on time for mine, yet my turn gets pushed out even if the late comer comes in physically later than me in the clinic. This process gives no incentive for patients to make accurate appointment booking in the system and make effort to be punctual. Does that mean next time I should just randomly book an early time slot and come later, since I will still be prioritised at the clinic? I explained to the nurse, but I was dismissed, she did not understand where I was coming from.\n\nAfter being failed by the seemingly-good online booking system, my confidence for this clinic has dropped significantly. I was intending to make this clinic my family clinic in the long run, but I don't think I can afford the unjustified long waiting time for every subsequent visit. I hope the management can look into the matter to regain patients' confidence for this promising clinic in the neighbourhood.","review_date":"2025-01-24T09:18:33.649Z","category":"education"}

We've been seeing Dr Teng since my son was born in June 2023, because we were looking for a kind doctor who could administer vaccines smoothly and not cause unnecessary distress (we had a bad experience at a polyclinic nearby). Dr Teng is one of those rare GPs who can give my son 3 jabs quickly and smoothly, soothe my son with a sticker or two and have him laughing. My husband and I have also seen Dr Teng for the occasional flu and were happy with the treatment. My helper also saw him for her health checkup and remarked that his drawing of blood was so painless.\n\nThe front desk team can be easily contacted by Whatsapp to arrange appointments, and they have actually REMINDED me when I forget that my son has a vaccination coming up.

This clinic doesnâ€™t operate per their opening hour stated on Google nor whatâ€™s app auto response.

Itâ€™s not a one time occurrence that the clinic is not open during its supposedly opening hours, itâ€™s multiple times. Also, the clinic never responds on time via WhatsApp about the change in opening hours. As a clinic, you donâ€™t operate by whim, you are there to provide a service for patients who stay in the neighbourhood. If one doctor cannot make it, you can have backup doctors. If you donâ€™t operate during certain days, thatâ€™s fine, but the very basic thing you can do is to at least change that in Google or website or WhatsApp auto response so that it doesnâ€™t not mislead patients.","review_date":"2024-06-23T10:39:29.023Z","category":"Retail"}

Sheâ€™s indubitably driven by what her patient needs and definitely not in the business of making a quick profit.

Before coming, I had already read some negative reviews about this clinic and was slightly concerned, but since this clinic is near our home, we decided to give it a try.\nThere were two doctors on duty and the queue moved fairly quickly, so we thought things would be smooth. However, when it was our turn, Dr Kohâ€™s very first question was whether my son was an NS personnel. The moment we said yes, he immediately remarked, â€œWhy not go and see the MO instead of coming here?â€ His tone and body language suggested that we were wasting his time. It felt as though he had already judged my son as someone trying to â€œchao kengâ€ (skive), instead of treating him as a genuine patient who was unwell.\nWe had to explain ourselves further before he reluctantly began his examination. Throughout, his attitude seemed dismissive and unempathetic. While he did eventually issue a one-day MC, the entire consultation left us feeling belittled and uncomfortableâ€”completely unnecessary for a patient who is already unwell.\nOn a positive note, the receptionist, Xin Yi, was professional, friendly and approachable. Her good service was the only saving grace of our visit and helped lighten the experience.\nThat said, we will not be returning to this clinic in the future, even if it means travelling further.

{"company_name":"Silver Cross Medical (Holland)","stars":"5","text":"Silver Cross Clinic in Holland Village has been my go-to general practitioner for several years now, and I continue to be impressed by the consistently high standard of care provided. The clinic is run by a male and a female doctor, both of whom are not only highly competent but also incredibly patient, kind, and thorough in their consultations.\n\nWhat truly sets them apart is the genuine care and attention they give to each patient. Whether itâ€™s a routine check-up or a more complex health concern, they take the time to listen carefully and explain things clearly, without rushing. Iâ€™ve witnessed them handle difficult or impatient patients with calm professionalism and empathyâ€”something not all clinics manage well.\n\nDespite the clinic often being busy, especially during peak hours, the waiting time remains quite reasonable considering the quality of service. I usually go early in the morning, just as they open, to be among the first, which Iâ€™ve found to be a good strategy if you're on a tight schedule.\n\nItâ€™s clear that both doctors are dedicated to maintaining a high level of service, and their consistency over time is something I truly value. In an age where many clinics feel rushed or impersonal, Silver Cross stands out as a place where patients are genuinely cared for.\n\nIf you're looking for a trustworthy and compassionate GP in the Holland Village area, I highly recommend Silver Cross Clinic. Youâ€™ll be in good hands.","review_date":"2025-05-26T03:17:24.993Z","category":"Food & Beverage"}

Upon arrival, the staff registered us and told us to wait. After about 30 minutes, I was informed that the doctor had ended her shift at 4pm (it was already 4:04pm), and that the locum doctor taking over could not see children.\n\nI was extremely frustrated â€” not only had we been sitting there waiting with a sick toddler, but no one informed us about the change in doctor or the fact that the next doctor wouldnâ€™t be able to help. When I asked what could be done, the receptionist simply told me to come back tomorrow. Thatâ€™s not a solution when a young child is unwell.\n\nThis level of miscommunication and lack of professionalism is unacceptable, especially in a healthcare setting.

Just today, I called twice in a row to book consultation for check up and the counter staff is very kind in advising me on what to do. Thank you, kind lady whose name I didn't manage to catch, for being patient with me when I was panicking a little over my discomfort :)","review_date":"2024-12-12T11:19:59.156Z","category":"food and beverages"}

I was pretty nervous going in, but she was so warm and approachable that it felt more like chatting with a friend than being in a doctorâ€™s office. She explained everything clearly and made sure I was comfortable the entire time.\n\nMy appointment was scheduled for 2:00 PM, but she was very prompt and actually saw me earlier at 1:30 PM and attended my appointment early, which I really appreciated. Everything was so well-organized and smooth.\n\nI also want to give a big shout-out to the nurses who took my blood. Even though I have tricky veins, they were so patient and reassuring. They never once made me feel embarrassed or uncomfortable. Instead, they kept checking in, apologizing for any difficulty, and making sure I was okay.\n\nOverall, this clinic goes above and beyond with their care and professionalism. If youâ€™re preparing for your medical exam, I highly recommend coming here.

{"company_name":"Health Partners Medical Clinic (Raffles Place)","stars":"2","text":"I visited this clinic today because Iâ€™ve been experiencing occasional sharp pain in my rectal area, and I wasnâ€™t sure if it was hemorrhoids or something more serious. While the registration process was fast and the receptionist was polite and welcoming, my experience with the doctor was quite disappointing.\n\nThe doctor seemed impatient, dismissive, and inattentive. When I explained my symptomsâ€”occasional sharp pain in my buttâ€”and mentioned that I suspected hemorrhoids, he asked me twice why I was there, as if I hadnâ€™t just explained it. I had to repeat myself and reiterate that I was worried about hemorrhoids and wanted treatment if necessary.\n\nWhen he asked how long Iâ€™d been having these symptoms, I said about a month. His response coupled with his facial expression, â€œThen why are you only coming today?â€ felt accusatory, as though he doubted my symptoms or my intentions for seeking care. I also mentioned that I sometimes notice blood in my stool, to which he replied, â€œJust now you said you didnâ€™t have blood in your stool,â€ which i did not say i didnâ€™t have blood in my stool, revealing that he wasnâ€™t fully paying attention to what I was saying.\n\nWhen I asked whether the issue would resolve completely with medication, his answer was a curt, â€œI donâ€™t know.â€ When I expressed concern about whether it could be something serious, like colon cancer, his response was, again, â€œI donâ€™t know.â€ I understand that not every question has an immediate answer, but thereâ€™s a more professional way to communicate uncertainty without making a patient feel dismissed.\n\nA quick rectal examination was done, and the doctor mentioned that if symptoms persist, he would refer me to a specialist for a more thorough examination. However, what I donâ€™t understand is why the doctor was so rude and impatient when I had already made it clear why I was thereâ€”to address rectal pain and check for hemorrhoids.\n\nOverall, this experience left me feeling unheard, dismissed, and dissatisfied with the care provided. Patients come to a clinic because they are worried about their health and need help, not to feel belittled or brushed off. I hope the clinic takes this feedback seriously and ensures a more professional and empathetic approach from its doctors in the future.","review_date":"2024-12-04T04:59:13.788Z","category":"Retail"}

The doctors seemed unprofessional, and simple check-up items like height and blood pressure were charged at unreasonably high rates. The nurses were not skilled at drawing bloodâ€”finding veins was difficult and painful. One male doctor, who was tall and slim and had some difficulty moving around, appeared to delay issuing test reports to encourage patients to undergo additional tests in their clinic with unreasonable prices. Moreover, if you choose to have tests done outside their clinic, they charge extra high fees, seemingly to pressure you into opting for those overpriced and non-transparent tests within their facility. The clinic also charges many miscellaneous fees, with no clear explanation or transparency. I donâ€™t understand why they suddenly changed their name; it feels like an attempt to escape a poor reputation.

When I did the online teleconsult with a Dr, he asked me to just redo the urine test with a dipstick test. Concerned about the cost, I asked how much it would be and he said $12. However when I went to the outlet, I was told that I have to see the dr on duty for consultation first before I can redo my urine test, and that was chargeable. Feels quite ridiculous and scammy that I have to pay to consult another Dr when I already spoke to a Dr on teleconsult.\nBut I went ahead with it anyway and the dr on duty said that he will recommend me to do the lab test instead of dipstick. He explained why and I said ok. Again, I enquired about the cost so as not to get any shock. He said it was about $12 and I could check the actual amount at the front desk.\nThe front desk then passed me the pee sample bottle and told me that the test & consult will be $100+. I was shocked but eventually had to agree to it since I was already there and they checked with the dr who insisted on the lab test. Disappointing experience as the dr should be better informed and more transparent on prices. $12 vs $100 is very different. Minmed should review the unnecessary step of 2 dr consults.

{"company_name":"Little Woods Montessori","stars":"5","text":"I had stalled sending my son (second child) to preschool after we moved to Singapore simply because I could not find a preschool that was as wonderful as the school his older sister had attended in our home country. I visited what seemed like every single preschool in our area and none of them \"clicked\" for me. That was until I visited Little Woods Montessori in Gentle Road. From the moment I stepped into the light, bright and beautiful ground-floor converted home - I knew I had finally found my son's preschool! The surroundings are so wonderful for a young child, it really feels like a home away from home rather than a learning institution. I was most impressed that day by witnessing what the children were doing. The activities are so wonderful for the body and mind. My son has absolutely thrived at Little Woods Montessori over the past two years. His fine motor skills are absolutely amazing and his knowledge of the world is beyond his years! The teaching and environment has been so incredibly nurturing. It is wonderful that they get to play outside on the grass playground in the fresh air every day! I have always felt that my son has been in safe hands and the teacher to student ratio is very low so they really get to know your child so well. As a family we have greatly enjoyed the Open House exhibitions over the years and have been amazed by what our son has created. Our only regret has been that we did not keep our son at Little Woods the whole way through until Age 6. We moved him after two years to his older sister's international school for the sake of convenience. At the international school, he is just a \"number\" and I have now realised just how incredibly high the teaching standards and care were at Little Woods! So I would have two pieces of advice for anyone wishing to send their child to a preschool in Singapore: First, you cannot go past Little Woods Montessori for the environment and quality of teaching and care. Second: Leave your child at Little Woods for as long as you can, you will find the standards of teaching and care at the \"big\" or international schools do not compare! We miss Little Woods so much and are very thankful for the incredible time our son has had there and for all of the valuable things that he has learnt.","review_date":"2020-02-27T03:20:06.241Z","category":"Food & Beverage"}

{"company_name":"BMTC School 4 (Rocky Hill Camp)","stars":"5","text":"I would definitely recommend staying at this resort for all tourists planning to visit Rocky Hill Nature Reserve. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in the deluxe 16-man forest villa as our suite enjoyed a panoramic forest view, as well as a beautiful view of the hotel lobby (parade square) from the balcony. Guests of the resort are sure to encounter some of the exotic native wildlife such as primates, bats and several avian species. If you are lucky, you may also be able to partake in a unique safari experience where the wildlife comes inside the villa itself, offering you a more intimate and unique experience. However, guests are advised to hide any snacks inside their state of the art metal finish wardrobes. Speaking of food, the resort offers a more pleasant dining experience than the Tekong Riviera Grand Hotel, but you may find the chicken a littleâ€¦ medium rare but also quite dry and stringy. additionally, the fried rice or noodles are occasionally dripping with oilâ€¦ how generous! despite some minor drawbacks, the bistro here certainly offers a finer dining experience than the dining halls at Ladang, and i must commend the variety of assorted free-flow beverages provided. Guests can also look forward to enjoying the weekly yacht service which shuttles them between the main island and the resort. The hotel staff are also not exactly friendly and shout at guests from time to time, but were still marginally better than what i expected before my stay here. Despite the apparent poor service of the staff, i still grew to see them with much endearment, and so did i enjoy sharing a suite with my fellow guests. Overall, i would say this is truly a unique resort concept, especially for those looking for an immersive ah boys to men experience.","review_date":"2024-06-22T14:00:38.977Z","category":"Food & Beverage"}

As a first-time mother who practiced full-time caregiving for the first 18 months, transitioning to preschool was a big stepâ€”not just for our son, but for us as well.\n\nWhile he still cries at drop-off, he now verbalises that he enjoys school and adores his teachers. Weâ€™re especially grateful for Ms Banu, Gu Lao Shi, and Ms Pearlyn, who have shown great patience, care, and attentiveness. Their nurturing approach has made a meaningful impact, and weâ€™ve noticed our son learning to respect both authority and his peersâ€”something we truly appreciate.\n\nThe recent parent-teacher conference only reinforced our trust in the school. During the 45-minute session, Ms Pearlyn and Ms Banu took the time to understand our concerns and worked with us to brainstorm practical, thoughtful strategies tailored to our son's needs. It was clear they see him as an individual, and we felt genuinely supported as partners in his development.\n\nThe school itself is clean, very new, and well-maintained. We also appreciate the emphasis on sensory play and Chinese language exposure. A big plus: our son hasnâ€™t fallen sick once since he started, which speaks volumes about the hygiene standards in place.\n\nOne small point of feedback would be the lightingâ€”it tends to be on the cooler side, like in an office. We hope there might be a way to introduce warmer lighting in certain areas to create a cozier, more relaxed vibe.\n\nOverall, we absolutely recommend MindChamps Pasir Ris. The teachers are dedicated, the environment is safe and enriching, and most importantly, our child is learning and growing in a space where he feels seen, supported, and secure.","review_date":"2025-06-05T03:18:08.362Z","category":"retail"}

It felt like she was just one of the numbers in the class. The experience left me and my husband very heartbroken as we were disappointed to see our precious child being neglected at school. However, the experience with Mind champs Pasir Ris mall was a total positive change. Ms Banu (English teacher) Gu Lao Shi (Chinese teacher ) and Ms Kwee Xin (music teacher) were extremely caring and dedicated. They made sure to help my daughter feel at ease, welcomed and gave her the necessary care and attention she needed, even helped to feed and try to finish her meals when she was not adept at using the spoon (the previous school wouldnâ€™t bother and would just remove her food once the time was up if it wasnâ€™t touched ) . We as parents feel blessed and grateful that we found this school under Mrs Koh and Ms Pearlynâ€™s leadership where they hire teachers who genuinely love children.

Our child  has always enjoyed going to Mindchamps and looks forward to interacting with his classmates and teachers.\n\nThe teachers throughout his Mindchamps journey has been nothing but wonderful. Caring, loving and with a passion to nurture, our child has blossomed in the time he has spent with them. The school environment is very clean and hygienic, school culture warm and welcoming. The outdoor area is a major plus point for us when choosing a preschool as we very much wanted outdoor play for our child. The outdoor space also doubles up as learning venue for a different kind of exposure and learning experience for the kids.\n\nThe Mindchamps programmes are very interesting and we appreciate that they encourage exploratory learning with the kids. Themes are set through each term with activities focusing  around the various themes. Lessons as I hear from our child are interesting, lively and very enjoyable. Itâ€™s a brilliant way for young minds to learn. Kudos to the teachers for always going the extra mile to creatively impart knowledge.\n\nFeedback from us parents are taken seriously and always addressed promptly which is something we appreciate a lot. Parent teacher conferences are held periodically on top of the updates we get on our child. This is always welcomed - afterall it is a partnership between us parents and teachers.\n\nIt is hard to say goodbye to such a great preschool. Our son speaks very fondly still of his preschool days and has asked for frequent visits back. It has been one of our best decisions to enrol him in Mindchamps!","review_date":"2023-03-08T12:59:31.992Z","category":"Hotels"}

This was important to us as we wanted our child to spend time in the sun too! Teachers also incorporated learning in the outdoor play to help kids to truly understand concepts.\n\nTeachers are prompt in responding to parents and always see themselves as a team with parents. This is a wonderful way of raising kids. In PG and Nursery, the focus is very much on social skills and interacting well with others while still keeping up with academic developments. In kindergarten, teachers focus on building independence with the kids and preparing them for primary school. Mindchamps CBP also has drama, ballet and music classes so kids are kept actively engaged in their interests.\n\nFood menus are shared with parents in advanced so you know what your kids are being fed. Always lovingly cooked fresh and kids also have sessions where they try their hand at preparing simple dishes.\n\nWe absolutely love having our child here!

Fortunately, Kinderland was really nice to take her back in and we have absolutely no regrets since. 5/5 (would have given an extra star or two if i could)","review_date":"2025-03-10T08:22:26.392Z","category":"Arts"}

I entrusted my first child to their care since infancy and have been consistently impressed, and I plan to send my second child there as well.\n\nThe teachers are incredibly personable and attentive, making both the parents and children feel comfortable and valued. They go above and beyond in their care and vigilance. For instance, they were the first to notice my child's cow milk protein allergy when it could have been easily dismissed as colic. This attention to detail gave us significant comfort, showing how closely they monitor each child's health and well-being.\n\nI highly recommend Kinderland at Loyang Point to any parents looking for a safe, nurturing, and professional environment for their little ones!","review_date":"2024-07-28T03:51:09.773Z","category":"Retail"}

{"company_name":"Kinderland Preschool @ Loyang Point","stars":"5","text":"We started sending my daughter to Kinderland. It started with my first call to ask for availability. It was a Friday, they took down our inquiry as the principal was not around. Shortly after we received a response from the principal and arranged for show around the school. We thought it was a small compound from the outside but we were wrong, as the school went through a renovation in 2018/2019 to expand its facility. The principal explained and shared patiently what we asked as we were anxious to find a school for our daughter. She assured us that the teachers have been working with them for many years as we do not want to stress our child with high teacher turnover. My daughter cried for 1st month as she was unfamiliar with the routine, fast forward 5 months later she is enjoying school everyday. The teacher will update us if they notice if my daughter was feeling unwell, recently she had an ear infection. We felt that we picked the right school for her as the teachersâ€™s care and attention were most important. Recently we celebrated ur daughterâ€™s birthday at school, we are surprised that teachers and principal coordinated with us as we like to have unicorn-theme (we supplied the balloons) and our daughter was thrilled when she saw the decoration. She was over the moon! To the teachers, this is one of the many celebrations they had but it meant something special for us as we didnâ€™t expect that they were so supportive. All of us enjoyed the party.

{"company_name":"Little Gryphons Montessori","stars":"5","text":"If you're looking for a school where your child will develop both valuable academic and life skills while building meaningful friendships, and looking forward to going to school every morning, look no further.\n\nMy son has been attending Little Gryphons Montessori since he was 3 years old. He's now 6 and preparing to say goodbye to the school and the friends he's made over the years. Looking back, I can say for a fact that I have never once regretted enrolling him at Little Gryphons (LG).\n\nThis is a school rooted in strong values, with lots of warmth and plenty of heart. It offers a safe, nurturing environment where children are encouraged to become confident, independent individuals. The transformation is evident â€” children who once arrived shy and unsure gradually blossom into bright, curious, and expressive little people who arenâ€™t afraid to ask questions or share their thoughts. This is a testament to the schoolâ€™s thoughtful unstifling approach and the positive influence of its teachers.\n\nThe school itself is well-maintained and spotless, with high-quality, mostly wooden materials that provide a calm and enriching environment for the children. I'm especially fond of the spacious layout, which emphasizes togetherness.\n\nThe teaching staff are nothing short of exceptional â€” nurturing, patient, and kind. They succeed in the challenging feat of making learning enjoyable for todayâ€™s children. A notable sign of the positive culture at LG is its low teacher turnover â€” in three years, I recall only one teacher being replaced. That level of consistency and stability speaks volumes, and is crucial in the children's development.\n\nA heartfelt thank you to:\n- Teacher Jameema, for your genuine interest in the children, your unwavering care, kindness, and dedication;\n- Teacher Jess for sparking a genuine interest in Mandarin among the kids;\n- Teacher Letchimi, for your irresistible bubbliness and bright energy (never change! :-));\n- Peh Laoshi for your sweet, calm demeanour;\n\nAnd of course, a big shoutout to Jacqueline and Terrence for setting up such a wonderful school. Little Gryphons was everything I hoped for when I was searching for a place where Adrian could thrive. I couldnâ€™t be more proud of the thoughtful, curious, and happy little man heâ€™s become.\n\nTo the whole Team LG: Keep up the excellent work.

{"company_name":"Little Gryphons Montessori","stars":"5","text":"My experience of Little Gryphons:\n\nIn January 2018 we enrolled our daughter of 19 months to Little Gryphons Montessori School.\n\nAs a working mummy, with a new baby on the way, we knew she would be needing some extra interaction with other children and wanted to settle her in before the baby arrived.  As an expat in Singapore this is not a decision we took lightly as in the UK usually we would wait a few years before play groups and any form of education began.\n\nWe visited with Little Gryphons and spoke to several teachers who talked very thoroughly through their Montessori approach daily routine and activities. After sitting down and talking with the teachers we were bowled over with the LOVE, PASSION and DRIVE expressed by all of them.\n\nWe left the meeting feeling overwhelmed and truly confident that this was the right descision and perfect school for our daughter.  She started off on 3 mornings a week from 9:00AM â€“ 12:30 AM.  Now nearly 3 yrs old we have increased to 4 mornings as we canâ€™t keep her away!  She is progressing with leaps and bounds (literally).  She smiles every day, sings all day long and her vocabulary is amazing.\n\nWhile there is a stairway up to the school, it is really not an issue. Once though the door it opens up into a beautiful warm, CLEAN, colourful friendly environment with lots of wonderful artwork and pictures all over the wall.  All of the toys, books and school equipment is of the highest standard which to me this seemed to lack in some of the other schools we had visited.\n\nYou are met every morning by a very friendly face and my daughter can not wait to go in to learn and play with her friends.\n\nThe teachers here truly do an EXCELLENT job in making sure all the children are happy and extremely well looked after, without failing to follow up with mummy via text messages if there is any concern at all.  On a weekly basis you are sent updates and photos of how they are getting on which also gives you a nice insight into their morning activities.\n\nLittle Gryphons Montessori is true to their mission and I can definitely say we could not be happier with the experience they provide â€¦\n\nâ€œOur goal is to provide a safe, loving and supportive environment for children to grow and learn in. We aim to foster creativity, encourage curiosity and instil within children a behaviour of independent learning and self-confidence in order to have an enduring and positive impact on the childâ€™s life.â€\n\nâ€“ Keep on doing what you do!!!","review_date":"2019-03-08T04:14:44.878Z","category":"food and beverages"}

Done already? Thatâ€™s all. Next time wait, donâ€™t interrupt. Have some mannersâ€ in front of my mom. Hello! How about you be considerate, responsible and reasonable?

But I think I had enough to say something about this school. I recently came to realization that my current classmate also graduated from this school as well and she withstand the same bs experience here as well (She graduated around 2021.)\n\nAt first, I thought it was just me who had a negative experience. But it's not just me.\n\nI endured years and years of hardships in this school. It seriously took a toll on my mental health. Almost anybody who goes in sane and normal also become abnormal. Been bullied... Nobody helped. Been sexually harrased by other classmates, still nobody helped. Teachers also don't give a shit. They cared more about grades than your well-being, with a bit of favourtism at play. The functional daily structure and system in this school was crappy and cheapskate. Everyday, the mantra was about resilience, as part of their school values. Like hello?!?! NOT EVERYTHING NEED TO BE RESILIENT, OKAY? There's this thing called human rights and being treated like a normal human being. Only when I graduated and moved on to poly, then I was referred for counseling.\n\nAt first, I thought I must be the only one feeling this way about this school. Turns out it's not just me. Last week, I found out my friend also graduated from here and her experience was hell too.\n\nAnybody thinking of putting their child here in this school/aspire to study here should really think twice.

By watching her, it also taught us how to be patient and not frustrated when the baby is crying and screaming. She also picked up the baby's patterns quickly and shared with us possible reasons why baby is upset eg. tired, gassy, hot so that we can quickly and effectively calm the baby.\n\nShe was also very knowledgeable in taking care of mummy. Once she knew our food preferences, we had great food every day, three times a day. Sometimes also with dessert. She advised what mummy can eat week by week, and also because our baby had jaundice there were certain foods mummy had to avoid. She kept the kitchen clean and neat, even better condition than it was before she came, haha.

She was also there for every dr's visit and somehow keeps up a much-needed aura of positivity even when we are all tired. It is also clear that Aunt Agnes loves children - it was reassuring to see her carrying and talking to baby when baby is fussing, and baby clearly calms down with her presence.\n\nAunt Agnes also took great care of us parents and the household. She prioritises our dietary preferences without compromising on confinement needs, and is super organised with a daily schedule of mealtimes and confinement bath preps. She is also clean and organised in both the prep works and cleaning up. As an experienced nanny with families in Singapore, we were also surprised and thankful that Aunty Agnes is knowledgeable about commonly bought + effective medications, baby items and where to get certain groceries locally. This provided us with a much needed peace of mind and support in this challenging period.

She carefully observed what I needed and prepared them ahead of time. For instance, I have a habit of expressing milk from one breast while feeding the newborn on the other. Sheâ€™ll ensure that the Hakka is ready whenever she brings my baby into the room for feedings. She also checks in regularly on my intake of red date tea and replenishes it timely.\n\nSheâ€™s also flexible, on days that I am unable to cook for my older son she offers to cook a separate portion with less ginger so itâ€™s toddler-friendly.\n\nIn the hours spent with her over conversation during meal times, I find her to be a sincere nanny who truly enjoys taking care of little ones.\n\nWould definitely recommend Nanny SOS, and will be back when I have my third child!","review_date":"2024-12-16T05:06:42.326Z","category":"Arts"}

{"company_name":"The Little House (Montessori)","stars":"5","text":"TLH is truly a preschool with a difference. We were sad when our son's previous school closed and we had to find a new school for K1. However, it turned out a blessing in disguise because we found TLH. Despite visiting 12 other well-reputed preschools, I'm so glad we chose TLH.\n\nMrs Katherine, TLH's founder and principal, has a strong vision for the school and how it runs. She is also the most on-the-ground principal I've seen! From being at the gate every morning to welcome the kids, to teaching them, and engaging parents at dismissal/coffee mornings I'm assured her high standards are kept. One thing that struck me when I first walked into the school was how the kids were calm, happy and engaged. I see the philosophy of the school in every aspect of how it is run. Even when I've faced challenging behaviours with my kids, Mrs Katherine has given me advice from her extensive experience and tried-and-tested philosophy.\n\nMrs Katherine and her teachers also make the effort to know each child individually. During parent teacher meets (and throughout the school year in fact), they share insights that would only come from spending enough time with my child and interacting with him meaningfully.\n\nMany schools claim to develop the child holistically. TLH truly does this and in unique yet effective ways.\n\nMy son's previous preschool never brought up his gross motor skills as a concern. At the first parent teacher meet with TLH, they told me it needed working on. I was initially in doubt as I saw him to be adept in the area, especially as we invested time in outdoor play every day after school. However, besides daily outdoor play, TLH also has the most creative races/obstacle courses that train different muscles. A year later, my boy started martial arts outside of school and surprised me and the coaches with his agility. When I asked him why he was so good at the exercises, he said it's like what they do at TLH!\n\nThey have weekly cooking sessions where the kids are given the chance to do everything themselves, even when cutting, grating and stir-frying! Since then, my son started having an interest when I bake at home and independently helps me out.\n\nMy son was exposed to science experiments in TLH too. On multiple occasions, he was able to explain how something worked when even my older P2 daughter couldn't. Again, he would cite TLH as his source of knowledge ðŸ˜„\n\nI find some preschools charge exorbitantly, and I really don't like how that is amplified during the usual year-end concerts. For TLH, I've always felt their pricing was reasonable, whether in term fees or add-ons. They do not charge extra for their year-end concerts, but instead make it a team effort, where the kids and teachers create the props, costumes and backdrops themselves. That said, if you are the sort of parent who likes perfectly polished concerts likened to watching The Sound of Music on Broadway, this may not be for you. Instead, we look forward every year to performances that allow kids to be kids, and are planned, practiced and performed with much ownership from the kids themselves.\n\nOne common misconception about montessori schools is whether kids would be able to transit to mainstream primary. My son who is naturally not the most studious, has had an easy transition into Primary school. In K1, he used to not be able to concentrate on work for longer than 10 minutes. He is now able to concentrate and finish 4-5 pages of homework, and still go on to study for tingxie. He is able to follow the structure of formal schooling yet have the confidence to answer questions when he wants to.\n\nJust in case this is all sounding too good to be true - we as parents get no benefit out of writing good reviews for the school. It is testament to how much we love TLH. Mrs Katherine and her team have been a God-send for our family! Thank you, TLH!","review_date":"2025-02-13T08:12:44.521Z","category":"Retail"}

{"company_name":"The Little House (Montessori)","stars":"5","text":"TLH is an outstanding preschool! I highly recommend it.\nThe principal (Mrs. Katherine) is also the founder and owner of the school. This means that she has final say of how to run the school and sees ideas thru to implementation. It is extremely valuable to have consistent leadership. She anchors and ensures that the school is run up to her high standards and principles, and based on sound research of what is best for children.\nThe children are taught to be socially aware, responsible and considerate. These and other good habits are inculcated from day one resulting in the school having a calm and cheerful atmosphere. Itâ€™s like a home away from home. The school motto is â€œhelp me help myselfâ€. There is a focus on confidence and initiative in the context of community. Mrs. Katherine is the model of a skilled and confident person. What better way to teach confidence than to exemplify it authentically! The teachers she selects are of high quality and quite a few have been at the school for many years. This means itâ€™s a stable environment for the children. My child often tells me how much he loves interacting with his teachers. It is a language-rich environment and I have never heard the teachers speak bad English or Mandarin.\nThis is a mixed age Montessori school. Older children are paired with younger ones and the kids learn social graces within community, not simply in theory. Older ones learn patience, leadership and kindness towards younger ones. Younger ones experience this and have confidence that one day they can in turn be in that role, rather than all children waiting on adults to serve them. All kids learn that they are active, useful and integral parts of their community thru everyday interactions.\nWhen I went for the school tour a few years ago, I was really caught off guard by 4 children coming up to me to see if I wanted a drink. They were going to pour water for me and host me! It is a true testimony as to how TLH respects children as individuals, believes in their abilities, and empowers them, to the point that the children were not unduly afraid of me, and saw it as their responsibility to host me, the guest in their school. I had visited 10 schools before deciding on this one and even my 1st runner up school is a far cry from what happened during my tour here. The other schools basically told the children to not disturb the adult talking with the principal and go do their own thing. Whereas at TLH, while no one interrupted the conversation, the children were instead encouraged to step up. They are not treated like a distraction to the â€œreal workâ€ that only adults do, but they are empowered to play key roles in the â€œreal workâ€. Imagine the feeling of accomplishment and personal value they feel, and how eager they would be to step up and take initiative again! It shows me how the teachers view the children and their abilities, and natural opportunities that can be seized to build the kids up. To me, these are very well trained and intelligent teachers, and I would be safe to partner with them for my childâ€™s learning journey.\nThere is an individualised learning plan for each child. Academic lessons like math and reading are done 1-1. The fast learner does not have to sit in a bored classroom learning what he already knows. The slower learner does not have to feel shame and be discouraged to try their best. The kids abilities are intimately known by teachers because of this 1-1 interaction.\nThere is cooking every week where the children themselves get to cook! One of life's greatest sensorial  experience. And they learn counting, fractions, mass and volume, chemical reactions, new vocabulary and all that academic stuff without even realizing it.\nMontessori schools are meant to be so much more than just Maria Montessori's materials. It is the entire ethos and community life, seeing thru childrenâ€™s eyes and respecting them as valuable individuals. TLH is a Montessori par excellence.","review_date":"2023-04-01T16:12:23.323Z","category":"Hotels"}

Our son learned a lot, made good friends and became an enthusiastic learner, thanks to TLH!","review_date":"2022-04-04T10:23:04.229Z","category":"Hotels"}

{"company_name":"The Little House (Montessori)","stars":"5","text":"This was the first kindergarten I viewed after we moved to sunset area. I stepped in an old fashion glass door and got a warm welcome from Mrs Katherine. She enthusiastically walked me around while introducing how the classes would be carried out etc. We walked to the outdoor area, kids were happily playing in the small garden. There came a little girl, she saw me and came close to me. Before I realised, she poured me a glass of water from their snack station, where I saw a tray with couple of glasses stacking up, a jar of water and bananas neatly laying on top of it. That was it. I cancelled all appointments with other kindergarten and enrolled my boy.\n\nMy boy was then 4yr8month, he enjoyed going to TLH so much. Every week he told me a new science experiment; a new country with either its language or food; a new role-play with manner; oh yeah, a new goodie he made under the instruction of teachers. I was very impressed. The teachers made it all seemed so effortless, yet meaningful.\n\nI remembered those days, parents gathered outside of the glass door where the kids lined up and got checked before going in school. Teachers welcomed kids with the brightest smile and funny talks. Mrs Katherine stood at her most comfy tree pose and chatted with us, we all started our days with lots of joy and laughter. Of course, most importantly, we knew our kids would have a wonderful school day at TLH.\n\nHow can I not mention the year end concert? It was fascinating. Nothing fancy but full of love and warmth. Teachers and kids designed their own stage, no one needed to wear special clothes or make-up. Kids chose what they most comfortable with and what they want to perform. They gave it their best on the stage. It was a pure joy for parents to see the how much their confidence have grown over a year. 2020, the pandemic hit. Teachers in TLH managed to gather all students single performing clips and created a long video. It was heartfelt. Still it seemed so effortless but meaningful.\n\nWe strongly recommend The Little House Montessori. It was the best decision to enrol our boy there. Everyday in his primary school life has benefitted greatly from his experience at TLH. Thank you all the lovely teachers in TLH.","review_date":"2021-06-14T04:29:34.324Z","category":"healthcare"}

{"company_name":"The Little House (Montessori)","stars":"5","text":"When we moved to Singapore three years ago, we visited about 15 preschools before we chose the Little House Montessori for our eldest child. We are absolutely thrilled with our choice, and this year, our younger child also started at TLHM.\n\nEach child has an individualised education plan, and the teachers are very tuned in to the needs and progress of every child. With their decades of combined experience, they provide a lot of support and advice around any developmental and behavioural issues that your child may face. Our children love the geography lessons, the science experiments, the weekly cooking, the play-based learning, and the structure they get at school. As parents, we love the wholesome (bilingual) environment, the wonderfully diverse student group, the excellent team of teachers and staff, and the inclusive community, all ably held together and led by the head directress, Mrs. Katherine. I especially appreciate the emphasis on good manners, the practical lessons in independence, the focus on the childrenâ€™s physical development, and the language support given for non-native Mandarin speakers. This is an incredible place for children to spend their early formative years, and I highly recommend the Little House Montessori to anyone who wants to inculcate confidence and a love of learning in their child.","review_date":"2020-08-17T02:57:40.493Z","category":"Arts"}

The students love interacting with her and looks forward to her lessons as she takes the effort to build strong relationship with the students.\n\nFor weaker students, she also takes the time and effort to encourage them, while spurring the classmates to do the same also.\n\nEvery year, no matter how busy she gets, she makes the effort to know the incoming orientation class as well, so that she knows everyone by name.

It is no surprise that she was loved and moved at the K2 graduation earlierâ€¦ itâ€™s almost like her graduation too as a 2nd mummy to the class. Don't be deceived by her coloured streaks and her tattoo - sheâ€™s puts her ALL in the role as an educator, disciplinarian, and most importantly friend. The kids know it too - my boy called her â€œhis best friendâ€ until the other boys bribed him away with PokÃ©mon cards.\n\nThe school isnâ€™t complete without the top-down support of Principal Ms Bee. She has the job of managing the school as a business and parents as customers - but we have never felt the disconnect vs. enrolling our boy in a school with a heart â¤ï¸","review_date":"2024-12-06T04:49:24.584Z","category":"Hotels"}

{"company_name":"Agora Colearning","stars":"5","text":"I have done the rounds of pre schools in Singapore over the past 7 years. I have looked for a preschool that actively cares and listens to the child, never leaves a crying child assuming theyâ€™ll â€™just be okâ€™ and a preschool where smiling teachers wholeheartedly nurture the children. Agora is the place! From the first day to the last, the team do everything they can to help the child settle, feel comfortable, develop relationships with all staff as well as other children and their parents. A special mention to Ms Eka, Ms Bell and Ms Pari who have done everything they can for my son - and for me too! Their warmth, consistency, effort, sense of humour and care has been the best model my son could have seen a pre school to be. Sometimes evidence of this is hard to prove in preschools, but I have seen first hand over a year how effective the whole team are at making children feel welcomed, safe and essentially HAPPY. I have learned so much myself from them even though I used to teach myself - it really is colearning! There really isnâ€™t anything like Agora in Singapore - it suits everyone from locals to expats and everyone is treated exactly how they should be - itâ€™s a beautiful hearty place to start your education journey with your child and I canâ€™t recommend enough. Thank you Agora and to the special teachers - you have made me look at my son differently, made me slow down my parenting and given my son space to be whoever he wants to be. Heâ€™s only had positive experiences at the centre and that alone is amazing. Even the children are all wonderful - Iâ€™ve seen so many progress right in front of me and itâ€™s purely because of the teachers. And to Ms Claire who runs the centre - you are as Iâ€™ve told you, an ANGEL! You shine bright and take everyone with you - how magical. I will not be having a third child, but if I ever did, they will be going here!","review_date":"2025-08-12T15:22:20.301Z","category":"Arts"}

My son, who has sensory and learning challenges, struggled to adapt in previous schools that simply werenâ€™t equipped to support his unique needs. After multiple attempts, we finally found Agora, and it has been nothing short of transformative.\n\nFrom day one, his teachers have provided not just instruction but deep, intentional care. They have taken the time to truly understand his emotional and learning needs, tailoring their approach to ensure he feels safe, valued, and capable. Their patience, creativity, and commitment have helped him make progress we once thought impossible. He is now more engaged, more confident, and most importantly, happy to go to school each day.\n\nAt the heart of Agoraâ€™s philosophy is its incredible head of Early Years director, Miss Claire. She doesnâ€™t just manage the programâ€”she listens. She understands that every child is different and ensures that each one is nurtured in a way that respects their individual journey. Her leadership fosters an environment where children are not just accommodated but genuinely celebrated for who they are.\n\nAgora is more than a preschool; it is a community that embraces diversity with warmth and sincerity. If you are a parent searching for a place where your child will be seen, heard, and supported, I cannot recommend Agora enough. I encourage you to visit, meet the wonderful educators, and see firsthand the love and dedication that make this school so special.","review_date":"2025-02-07T13:03:47.271Z","category":"healthcare"}

There was still plenty of space left for tables and chairs to be set up for guests to sit and dine. Overall, the whole area wasn't cramped and was good for our party size of 30+ guests (both kids and adults).\n\n4. One advantage of working with Agora was their tie ups with their vendors. I did not have to go through the trouble of finding my own vendors. Through the recommendation of Aishah, I engaged a balloon sculptor, bouncy castle and a face painter. Both vendors were not only prompt to come early but were excellent in their services. The kids had so much fun face painting and getting animal balloons.\n\n5. Accessibility was easy even though it was located at Harbourfront Centre. Plenty of parking spaces within the building.\n\nAll in all, I would highly recommend working with Agora and renting their spaces for kid's birthday parties.\n\nWould love to show photos of the venues but all the photos have images of my child and the kids of the guests.

I remember back in the black and white house, every time I passed by the school playground around 5pm, I saw not only the kids having fun, but all teachers there with the kids, running, chasing each other, laughing, and very engaged. I could see the teachers truly enjoyed being with the kids and love what they do.\n\nMy daughter was shy and resistant of going to school before LW. We thought it was just her personality. However since she got into LW, she's been super excited to go to school every day, and whenever I asked her, she would say she \"Love the school and the teachers\".\n\nThe school also has a lot more fun filled classes throughout the day, a lot more than usual preschools. They have dedicated teachers for each of sports, music, art, speech and drama subjects, and dedicated space for each subject. My daughter always had so much fun in school that I didn't mind keeping her there for the full day till 5:30pm. She probably wouldn't have had equal amount of fun and engaging activities in a social setting if she comes home earlier.\n\nStill, on top of all the amazing resources and hardware, what's important to us as parents, in the end, is the team working in the school. Despite the fact that they lost their own outdoor space, the teachers mostly remained the same, and most teachers have been there for many years. Tbe fact that they cared so much about the kids and loved their work, made me decide to stay with the school after the move.\n\nI believe hardware is easy to get.

{"company_name":"Lorna Whiston Preschool (Hort Park)","stars":"5","text":"LW Winchester has a great learning environment and strong teachers guiding the children. Given LWâ€™s background they are naturally strong in English but I feel that their Chinese curriculum is truly amazing and most of their Chinese Teachers (Native Chinese) are fairly long tenured & experienced. My 9 year old boy started at LW PG at 1.5 yrs, and most of the Chinese teachers then are still around. My 6 year K2 girl is graduating this year and she is able to read many Chinese books by herself which I was personally quite impressed by. She was even able to read most of the common words ç±³å°åœˆ which completely surprised me. We have not sent our kids to any Chinese enrichment programmes while they were at LW and my boy has been able to cope well after in Primary school. I really attribute that to the strong bilingual environment and strong academic foundation that LW has given my children.\n\nBooks are readily available in the classrooms and there are reading programmes. Children also get to bring home 2-4 books every week to read. LW has also done a great job inculcating a love of reading in my children.\n\nAside from academics, I think their biggest strength is that they have a good balance between play and learning. The children also have a lot of time to play and express their creativity. They truly enjoyed their time in LW and Iâ€™m also very grateful to the school.","review_date":"2021-08-17T02:21:14.459Z","category":"Retail"}

Many of the staff have seen our kids grow up from an infant and it always feels like bringing our kids to extended family. Special shout out to Qiu Laoshi who, hands down, is our younger oneâ€™s favourite teacher for the past 3 years - we are simply blown away by the level of care and concern she has shown.

Everyday as one drives into the school, you are greeted with warm and cheery staff, especially one of its directors, Ms Sarah Goh. It is a happy school. More importantly, the values of integrity and compassion are well embeded into the teacher-staff-student daily learning and communication. We appreciate ICS for giving my child the opportunity to choose and grow in his areas of interest. In his Senior thesis, he was allowed to choose a topic of interest, that is, increasing the social virality of his Youtube channel. In the course of this, he was able to develop his research and communications skills. Second, ICS has sufficient module offerings to allow my child to grow his giftings. For example, being part of the School Yearbook team, he was able to hone his photography and editing skills. As a result, he was able to intern, upon graduation, at a photo studio. This has led to an opportunity to help out in documenting and producing 20 individualised photobooks for persons living with dementia and the Senior Centre's staff and volunteers.

It allows students like myself to have a good perspective on what the topic actually is without getting scared by the more difficult problems that the topic may have to offer, allowing me to score more marks during the exam as I am able to rely on the few important question processing steps that he has emphasised during lessons.\n\nMr Lim makes learning easier by giving many real life examples and applications of the sciences that we are learning in class, making information stick and making it easier for me to retrieve information during exams. He plans his lessons meticulously and has a plan for each stage of learning that we are in, whether it be in studying or revision. He goes the extra mile by sorting through years and years of past year papers from other schools and picking out the most interesting ones so that we are better equipped to answer whatever questions come out for the exams; which can be quite erratic as is the nature of the science exams, which is why his extensive combing is much appreciated\n\nIt has been a joy to be the student of the amazing teachers here and their continuous help throughout the years truly allowed me to perform my utmost best during the exams. I cannot recommend this place enough.","review_date":"2023-12-31T08:17:19.983Z","category":"Hotels"}

My daughter spent nearly three years there, and those years laid a truly beautiful foundation for herâ€”socially, emotionally, and intellectually. She made friends for life and experienced a nurturing environment that continues to shape her even after our move to Canada.\n\nWhat impressed me most was how seamlessly the teachers at Nurtured Nest instilled a sense of discipline and individuality from such a young age. For young girls in particular, itâ€™s so important to learn that their voices matter and their opinions are valuedâ€”and this was deeply embedded in the school's ethos. Remarkably, the confidence and curiosity my daughter developed at Nurtured Nest helped her transition smoothly to her new school, where she continues to thrive.\n\nBeyond the childrenâ€™s growth, the school embodies the multicultural spirit of Singapore. Every festivalâ€”whether Chinese New Year, Hari Raya, or Diwaliâ€”is celebrated with equal joy and inclusiveness. As parents, we were welcomed as part of a larger extended family, and I still fondly remember looking forward to each of these celebrations.\n\nChoosing Nurtured Nest was one of the best decisions we made for our daughter.

{"company_name":"Nurtured Nest","stars":"5","text":"Our two young boys attended Nurtured Nest from around 17â€“18 months old and spent several wonderful years there. We initially chose NN because of its focus on outdoor play, child independence, and its warm, community feelâ€”and it delivered on all fronts.\n\nOne of the selling points for us for us was the small class sizes. Our boys were in groups of just 6â€“12 children, not in a room of 30. This made a huge difference in the level of care and attention they received. Every morning began with outdoor playâ€”rain or shine. On rainy days, the kids were bundled up in raincoats and boots, and we absolutely loved this commitment to outdoor time and resilience.\n\nThe small size of the school means the staff can really tailor care to each child. Toilet training, for example, was handled with patience and support. All staff knew the children and families well, which created a strong sense of connection and made for a gentle, nurturing transition into school life.\n\nHealthy, varied meals are provided, and the children are introduced to cooking activities from as young as 18 months, which they loved. Forest school is also introduced to the kids around 4.\n\nAs a relatively new school, Nurtured Nest had a few teething issues in its early yearsâ€”mainly around communication and some staff turnoverâ€”but to their credit, these were acknowledged and addressed. So please read old reviews with compassion, building a school is no easy feat! The team clearly puts a lot of thought into ensuring staff align with the schoolâ€™s ethos, which takes time and required hard choices but pays off.\n\nOur children were very happy there, and we were genuinely sad to leave when we relocated.

{"company_name":"Nurtured Nest","stars":"5","text":"I was most fortunate to do my practicum placement at Nurtured Nest Preschool for 1 month in the capacity of a teacher-in-training while I was pursuing my diploma in Early Childhood Care and Education. The team of teachers are passionate for the childrenâ€™s learning, social emotional well-being, and most importantlyâ€” FUN! The activities organised for the children are catered to their interests and needs, and are very much authentic learning experiences which engage the childrenâ€™s 5 senses, and gives them plenty of opportunities to play and work with one another in the great outdoors. It is not your typical preschool where children are forced to sit down and listen to a static, academic lesson from a whiteboard, but instead a play-based school where they are fully immersed and engaged in their learning. Children spend lots of time getting messy and dirty in the sand and rain (with raincoats and boots of course!), creating masterful artworks with paint and loose parts and glue, or simply just having a picnic in the grass patch behind the school. This is not just a great school for young children, but for any potential practicum students who are looking for a unique, vibrant, and out-of-the-norm preschool as an attachment centre.

{"company_name":"My First Skool at Blk 260 Bukit Batok","stars":"5","text":"This childcare centre by MFS is a hidden gem. My elder boy entered the centre halfway in K1 (in 2019) and the teachers (Luo Laoshi & Teacher Ram) did a great job to assimilate him and encouraged the other children to engage him. For a boy who cried daily at drop off in his previous school, we were prepared that he'll cry again, but to our surprise, he didn't cry at all during this transition and thereafter, enjoyed going to sch daily until he graduated last year.\n\nMy younger child now has the same privilege to be cared for by the same team of dedicated teachers (Luo Laoshi, Teacher Ram & Teacher Kavitha).\n\nCurriculum wise, I had my concerns initially like most parents - shd I pay more for better academic focus? That's always the scale that most parents would weigh, but my concerns were allayed as I've come to realize that MFS is a good balance of both affordability and quality. My elder boy enjoyed learning through the various inquiry projects - there would be different themes each term and the teachers put in a lot of effort to pique children's curiosity via hands-on activity, parent engagement,  relation to current affairs and relevance to primary school. The teachers also took many pictures of my child in action and I can easily view the pictures weekly in the parents portal to see what they've learned in school. My boy excelled under this system and is now doing well in primary school with strong foundation set during the 2 yrs of his time in MFS.\n\nApart from its team of caring and competent teachers, the centre's layout is also a plus point. The classes are split into 3 different bays around blk 258/260, so cases of hfmd, and even covid were kept to a minimal.\n\nMany parents who sent their children to this centre also echo my same view and thus I'd not hesitate to recommend this centre to my family, neighbours and friends.","review_date":"2022-04-29T00:40:14.571Z","category":"retail"}

{"company_name":"Arts Junior Montessori Preschool","stars":"1","text":"I would like to recount my experience at the school and for all parents to be informed. My child was severely injured with a bone displacement and fracture and was not given first-aid. The school also did not inform me of the injury and she was crying for at least 45 minutes till I arrived to pick her. She was clutching her injured arm, sitting beside two teachers who were nonchalantly cutting paper and not paying any attention to her. She was later admitted to A&E and was there for 9 hours.\n\nWe then found out that they had hired an illegal worker who was supervising the children. Unfortunately, the School avoided all responsibility and refused to meet with us nor the parents of the two boys who caused the injury. The School's owner (Ms Momoyo Misugi) also prevented one of the boy's mother from apologizing to us as she said that my father threatened to beat the boys. When we confronted her on this matter, she panicked (wondering how we got to know about it) and brushed it away saying that she may have misheard my father.\n\nWith regards to the illegal employment, the School maintained that the person was an 'observer' and was not paid. Other parents and I saw the person for more than 3 weeks and actively working with the kids. Not just observing. The School then told ECDA that the person was there for only less than a week.\n\nFor close to 9 months, Ms Misugi refused to meet us till she finally relented to pressure from ECDA (government). Even to fix a date for the meeting, she kept saying she was not free or was overseas. On a day that she was supposed to be away, she was caught red-handed by ECDA to be in the School.\n\nWith the influx of students since Jan 2017, there's been much overcrowding, poor control and hygiene especially at the toilets. The teachers look irritated and harassed especially with the younger children crying non-stop and their diapers falling off because the teachers are just overwhelmed with the number of kids.\n\nThey also sent us reminders of late payment on school fees during the months that my daughter was recovering from her fractured and displaced arm. We found that to be in such poor taste. We also had a hard time enrolling her in a new school as they did not release her name from the childcare link system. The School also refused to return us our deposit.\n\nI also heard from another parent about her son being bitten by mosquitoes/bugs so badly he came home with 12 very swollen and lumpy bites all over his legs and body. The parents asked the school and they simply replied that there were no other cases so the boy must have gotten it from elsewhere. The parent was very upset with the dismissive attitude. She pulled her child out.\n\nIn my 1+ year enrolling my child in the school, more than 4 local principals/administrators came and left. There was also high turnover of admin staff. I thought something was very wrong when teachers also started to leave all of a sudden. I know of at least 2 teaches who went on leave and never came back.\n\nBack in 2016/17, the school did not take temperature and check for HFMD. I am not sure if that is allowed. We highlighted this to them several times and they made some attempt of getting parents to record the temperature before coming to school. I believe this is not in line with ECDA's requirement.\n\nHope to bring awareness to other parents out there.","review_date":"2018-05-31T02:07:58.112Z","category":"Hotels"}

On their way home, mother found 3 injuries in arm (bleeding), knee and inside mouth (bleeding). We complained over phone but the school didn't admit nor apologize. On the contrary, they suspected she was injured after school and asked us the possibility of injury after school repeatedly even after we explained the possibility of 3 injuries without our perception was nil.\n\nI was surprised and frightened with the fact that,\n1.The school was totally unaware of 3 injuries.

The frequent updates on her activities at infant care are heartwarming, and we can see that our baby is happy spending time with her teachers and her baby friends.\n\nA big thank you to Teacher Irene, the infant care lead, Principal Janice, Teacher Annu, Teacher Marliana, Teacher Sharon, LeeLee Laoshi, Teacher Sya, and all the staff (including teachers from the other groups who sometimes receive our baby when we drop her off at the infant care)!","review_date":"2025-04-05T06:55:19.800Z","category":"Arts"}

But over time and with a lot of guidance and patience from his IFC teachers, he was able to start on purÃ©es and fruits a little by little. And when he transitioned to porridge after turning 1, he did even better on that and slowly was introduced to more solids.\n\nI appreciate the constant updates from the teachers and having an open line of communication with the principal put me at ease to know that my child was well supported and taken care of and that my concerns were always heard and responded to.\n\nFrom my child taking his first steps to him learning to sit and read and focus on an activity, I'm very glad for his teachers and all the guidance, love and passion put into ensuring his growth.\n\nI would like to specially mention his IFC Teachers Irene, Reena, Jes, Noraini and Principal Janice for every bit of confidence, love, compassion and care that they put into caring for and instilling values to my child.","review_date":"2024-07-02T02:33:45.455Z","category":"Food & Beverage"}

The staff were warm and friendly, patient with our queries, and accommodating about our requests. They provided us timely updates about the care and feeding of our son, were always willing to share about his day when we picked him up, and generous with advice without being prescriptive or intrusive.\n\nAll this would have been ample reason for us to give a 5 starred review. But Cheston and its staff went beyond this. They had an engaging programme for our son, teaching him many things and developing his growing mind through creative and age-appropriate activities. The staff made it a point to get to know our son as an individual, and share specific insights which helped us to get to know him better too. Their warmth and professionalism were instrumental in our sonâ€™s development, and their responsibility in executing their duty of care allowed us to return to full-time work without having to worry.\n\nWe have now sent our second son (4 months old) to Cheston, and are so glad to have their support and care again. Cheston has worked hard to make the school a second home, a second family, for the children, regardless of age.

{"company_name":"ACS International","stars":"5","text":"I wanted a different experience for my older girl after PSLE and attended the open houses of all the local intl schools. We chose ACS Intl due to a few factors, proximity, Alma Mater of husband and from the general feel of the school. We noticed during the open house that the kids were allowed to present and run some parts of it independently. This was a good sign - didnâ€™t matter if it wasnâ€™t 100% perfection as kids would learn how to talk to adults and present themselves. We took the plunge and she was our guinea pig. She completed four happy years there and went on school trips where she learnt how to look after herself away from home. Prepared her well to study overseas. Teachers are kind and able to provide actual detailed feedback. As an example, I was told she could benefit from cooking more at home to help with her Chemistry practical skills which was very true. After that her sibling also joined the school and am happy to say the experience is consistent. If you want happy well adjusted kids I can recommend this school. I must add that bullying is not tolerated and the school is quick to address behavioral issues. In terms of academics your child should have no issues if they do their work consistently as tests are based on what they teach at school and the school has a good balance between work and play. For CCAs lots of options and chances to try new things. I have met random parents from the school over the years and most have used the word â€œthriveâ€ to describe their childâ€™s experience. Overall the intangible things I have noticed in both kids are an increase in confidence, they are not scared to sign up for new things and willing to take the risk of failure after one or two years here,  best is yet to be!","review_date":"2024-03-27T07:36:18.849Z","category":"healthcare"}

Throughout his education at the centre, he had amazing teachers. The Principal and all the teachers are very warm, approachable, enthusiastic and caring in their interactions with the children and parents.  They are always updating me about my son during send off and pick up, updates in the communication book, child's portfolio, parents portal and meet the parents sessions are some of the useful communication channels  that I find useful to get insights in his progress in school.  The teachers make observations and document them to keep track of the childrenâ€™s development and ensure that they reach their milestones. The teachers supported, encouraged and helped in other aspects such as doing daily routines independently, eating their fruits and veges and even potty training. The teachers, at every level built great relationships with him. This makes him feel safe in school and in turn, enjoys going to school.\nThe centre teachers take a lot of time and effort to make the classroom a conducive and playful atmosphere for the children based on the the different learning themes throughout the year. This sets an engaging atmosphere for them to play and learn. My son always talks about the different themes at the Dramatic Corner and Learning Centres that the teachers prepared. The centre encourage learning and bonding time at home with the take home activities that are based on the learning themes. The classrooms are clean and neat.  Baskets with learning tools and toys are organised neatly in shelves so that the children can easily pick them based on their interest.\nThe centre has a well rounded curriculum.  Some of the lessons that my son enjoys are music and movement, story telling,  phonics, gross and fine motor activities and outdoor walks in the neighbourhood. His learning experiences in the centre helped and encouraged him to be a curious learner and confident little boy!","review_date":"2022-05-17T17:32:27.920Z","category":"retail"}

We can tell that the teachers care for the children with love from their hearts. They take care of their eating, napping, toileting, and also teach lessons and build their characters. They are encouraging when the children are hesitant to try new things, yet firm with what they can do and cannot do. They understand the different personalities of the kids and will adjust the teaching methods accordingly. They provide timely and detailed feedback to the parents. Ms. Alina, the principal of the school, is one of the most lovely ladies I have ever seen. She always talks with a smile on her face. Her tone itself is reassuring enough. She supports the children in every possible way that helps them thrive.\n\nAnother big thumb up for the school is its curriculum. The curriculum is well-designed with tons of enrichments. For example, the kids have their learning journey every month. My son is so excited to tell us about what he sees outside the school during his learning journeys!

{"company_name":"MindChamps PreSchool @ Holland Village","stars":"5","text":"We enrolled our daughter at MindChamps Preschool when she was 2 years old, and the transformation we've witnessed has been truly remarkable. From the very beginning, we noticed a positive shift in her demeanour, curiosity, and overall development.\n\nMindChamps' holistic approach to early childhood education has played a pivotal role in her growth. The curriculum, designed to foster creativity, critical thinking, and social skills, has provided her with a solid foundation for learning. Through engaging activities like Champsâ€™ Discovery and personalized attention from dedicated teachers, she has blossomed into a confident and inquisitive young learner.\n\nOne of the most significant improvements we've observed is in her communication skills. She now expresses herself with clarity and confidence, eagerly sharing her thoughts and ideas with others. Moreover, her problem-solving abilities have greatly enhanced, as she tackles challenges with resilience and determination.\n\nAdditionally, we're thrilled to note huge improvement in her Chinese language proficiency. MindChamps' immersive The Love for Chinese Language programme has ignited her interest in Mandarin, and she now converses fluently and comfortably in both English and Mandarin, a skill we know will serve her well in the future.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that my elder son also attended MindChamps Preschool from PG to K2, and we saw tremendous improvement in him as well. Witnessing his growth and development during his time at MindChamps was one of the reasons why we chose the same preschool for my daughter. The positive impact it had on my son's academic and personal development gave us confidence in the school's ability to provide an enriching and nurturing environment for my daughter as well.\n\nMoreover, she is a very active child who loves performing. MindChamps has provided her with numerous opportunities to explore her passion for movement and expression through various activities in the Creativity and Theatrical Strategies as well as Neuromooves classes. These experiences have not only allowed her to channel her energy in a positive way but have also contributed to her physical coordination and confidence.\n\nBeyond academic achievements, MindChamps has also nurtured her emotional intelligence and character development. She demonstrates empathy, kindness, and respect towards her peers, embodying the values instilled by the school.\n\nAs parents, we couldn't be more delighted with her progress at MindChamps Preschool. It's evident that sheâ€™s not only learning, but also thriving in an environment that values her individuality and encourages her to reach full potential. We're grateful to the dedicated teachers and staff who have played a pivotal role in her journey, and we look forward to seeing her continued growth and success in the years to come.\n\nThank you, MindChamps, for providing our daughter with a nurturing and enriching preschool experience.","review_date":"2024-06-29T01:57:18.904Z","category":"retail"}

She could even explain the child developmental reasoning behind why the school purchased certain toys over others. It all seemed so thoughtfully designed.\n\nMy daughter started at the youngest level and continued all the way through (until the end of K2). She enjoyed going to school every day and always spoke warmly of her teachers and principal. She never felt stressed there, yet she learned so much that she is at a strong advantage in primary school. The Schoolhouse helped her through many of childhood's challenges with patience and experience, and my daughter and her classmates all grew to become great friends over the years.

Proposing alternatives / additional learning lessons to improve my son's learning in preparation for the PSLE in 2024.\n\nMy son's improvement from getting a constant average grade to getting a satisfactory grade is commendable.  Matrix encouraged Jerel not to give up; nurturing him to continue to maintain/develop an interest in doing Maths. The positive reinforcement does improve his confidence to a certain extent.\n\nAs the class size is small, the teacher (Mr. Foo) allows for more individualized attention which benefits my son to fit his learning pace/needs.\n\nJerel is comfortable with the Home-Matrix distance as it is a straight bus journey taking bus number 180.  Passing by the Jurong East Sports Centre simply brightens up his bus ride for tuition as he is a sports lover.  Convenient and with a coffee shop downstairs, Jerel always looks forward to attending the class followed by his favorite Kolo Mee before heading home.\n\nI have confidence that Matrix will continue to help Jerel to build a solid foundation of knowledge in Maths and he will be able to meet his realistic academic goals.\n\nOnce again, thank you Matrix :-)","review_date":"2024-12-07T05:16:06.472Z","category":"Retail"}

The variety keeps the children engaged and excited to go to the center every day.\n\nThe facilities are clean and thoughtfully designed for young children. There are plenty of safe indoor and outdoor play areas, and the classrooms are bright, welcoming, and filled with stimulating educational materials.\n\nBut what really sets the center apart is the staff. The principal, teachers and caregivers are incredibly warm, patient, and attentive. They clearly care about the children and take the time to understand each child's unique needs and personality. Communication is excellentâ€”they regularly update me on my child's progress, daily activities, and any concerns. It truly feels like a supportive and nurturing environment.","review_date":"2025-05-16T07:15:53.339Z","category":"Arts"}
{"company_name":"Green Pastures Child Centre","stars":"5","text":"This is a wonderful kindergarten that will see your child through from 18 months to kindergarten 2.\n\nI am a mother of 5 and my 3 younger children attended Green Pastures. I have had the blessing of being a parent of Green Pastures for over the past 7 years. I've had other experiences with preschools in the neighborhood and in my opinion GP has been the best.\n\nGP will bring your children up with LOVE and they are committed to imparting the right VALUES in them. Which is really all that these little ones need at this point in their lives. GP teachers tend to follow their class group from N1 to K2 which means the children do not have the stress of acclimatising to a new personality every year. This is something our family continues to cherish about this school.  This has provided our children with the sense of family within the school which has contributed to filling them with a deep sense of stability and the confidence to build strong relationships later on in primary school. Growing our children up in love and stability has become an underrated feature of our early education and this is what Green Pastures does best.\n\nIf you ever get to visit the school, you will be greeted by a warm red brick house and a beautiful playground set under the loving boughs of one of the oldest rain trees in Singapore. In the same way that this ancient sage tree is home and hearth to many tropical ferns, vines, squirrels, woodpeckers and other wonderful avian visitors - GP has provided my family with deep roots in love and my children the opportunity to use this support to go on to grow their own communities.","review_date":"2025-05-16T02:05:22.383Z","category":"food and beverages"}

My daughter adapted and less crying very quicker than I imagined it would be.\n\nShe have learned so much in speech, identifying, socialising, writing, trying to read words, etc in English and even improved so much in her Mandarin.\n\nMy spouse and I seen how our daughter grew to become so independent and the things she learnt there are really broad and sometime in our opinion deep for her age, example identifying all the planets and remembers them, saying all the shapes include â€˜rhombus shapeâ€™. etc. We too have our son joined the sister and seen him grew in fast pace especially in speech.\n\nMy son went through a tough 1 week of separation anxiety too but very comfortably adapted to it after and love going to school. Seeing him so comfortably walking in as if he entered his second home felt very comforting.\n\nI love how the curriculum involve parents and children time to accomplish a task. It helps us to bond with our kids and also create meaningful moments and conversation around doing homecraft together.\n\nAll the teachers are so dedicated. Their love and care for the children can be seen on how they update you about your children. I remember indicating I wish my daughter to improve in her mandarin speaking in the next term during one of our parent-teacher meet, I saw progress of my daughter really improve in making initiative to speak in mandarin and identifying mandarin words.\n\nBoth my children love their teachers so much! Can see my daughter excitement everytime she talks about her teachers and about her day at school. And my son so happy and cheerful to see his favourite teacher at the door so welcoming. It is so heartwarming watch they enjoy school and know that they are in safe environment and are in good caring hands.\n\nAll in all, I would definitely recommend friends and families who are planning to send their child to school for the first time here. Both my children built a strong learning foundation here.","review_date":"2023-05-31T09:35:24.100Z","category":"Retail"}

Highly recommended to any family looking for a loving and professional nanny.ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘","review_date":"2025-08-24T02:12:40.649Z","category":"Arts"}
{"company_name":"PEM Confinement Nanny Agency Pte Ltd","stars":"5","text":"I am thankful for Nanny Lai Chunâ€™s (#1888 - Ten Lai Chun) help during this confinement period. As a first time mom, I struggle with knowing how to care for baby and also myself after delivery. Nanny Lai Chun was consistently assuring, supportive and patient in terms of caring for both my baby and me.\n\nIn terms of babyâ€™s hygiene, she is extremely thorough, clean and diligent, going the extra mile to check babyâ€™s diaper frequently and changing it promptly. I also appreciate that she is always willing to share and recommend good practices and baby products that she came across using with previous clients. Overall, she genuinely cares and tends to my baby very well. I feel assured leaving my baby under her care.\n\nIn terms of motherâ€™s care, though she has her pov re how things need to be done and is open to share them, but she is also very aware and sensitive to my preferences. She would check in on how I feel, how I want things to be done and what kinds of food I like and tries her best to prepare them for me. She also takes initiative to provide extra help eg put my clothes in to wash (on top of doing babyâ€™s) whenever she has the time or bandwidth to do so.\n\nNanny Lai Chun is generally also easy going and friendly. I find myself being able to chat comfortably with her about life and this helps me to get through the sometimes tiring confinement days. Thank you again, Nanny Lai Chun!","review_date":"2025-08-23T11:52:10.103Z","category":"Arts"}

Especially doing well for the night feeding. She wakes up whenever the baby needs to feed or when cranky. She would keep track the baby's cleanliness and change the diaper frequently.","review_date":"2025-08-23T01:36:19.651Z","category":"healthcare"}
