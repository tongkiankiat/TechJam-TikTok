NoiseGuard is an ML-powered system designed to make location-based reviews more trustworthy by filtering out noise; spam, irrelevant, and low-quality content, before it reaches users.

Online reviews directly influence how people choose restaurants, shops, and services. However, fake promotions, irrelevant comments, and copy-paste spam distort trust and harm both users and businesses. NoiseGuard solves this by combining machine learning with rule-based heuristics to automatically enforce content policies and highlight only authentic, relevant reviews.

With NoiseGuard, users get clearer insights, businesses enjoy fairer representation, and platforms reduce the manual burden of moderation while strengthening credibility.
