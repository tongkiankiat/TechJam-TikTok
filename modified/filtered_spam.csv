Fullerton Dental,4,"Today I went back to Dr Mok for tooth cleaning. As usual, Dr Mok is professional and gentle. I knew her in Nov, 2020, when I went to have the wisdom tooth removed. There was an extreme pain due to the pressure induced from the wisdom tooth. I expressed my suffer to the young lady in the counter, after a short check, she decided to let me in during the Dr’s break time. After x-ray, Dr Mok discussed the condition of the two visible wisdom teeth with me. Then everything went through smoothly. Blood stopped hours later. Quick recovery (2~3 days) and no pain after removing one wisdom tooth. One week later, I went for a bite wing x-ray to check risk of cavities (one-time check valid for 3 years) and had normal tooth cleaning.
The service is excellent, though the price is a little high (even with student discount). But Dr Mok and her assistant can be trusted!",2021-08-18T10:14:40.719Z,healthcare,True,Promotional content detected,159,864

她问了我一些几个月前的检测相关的问题，我一时记不起来，需要点时间回想，她却像是急着要答案一样，完全不给缓冲的空间。整个对话过程让我感到非常不舒服，沟通体验极差。",2025-06-19T01:27:46.844Z,healthcare,True,Too few words (4 < 10),4,192

National Cancer Centre Singapore,1,"Don’t tell people to put wheelchair outside hallway for public use when they still need it. You know how hard it is to find another in the other floors beside entrance? If the patients need the wheelchair they would’ve got the chair before they entered.

I visited the hospital with my grandma today and when she went in for her treatment, I waited for her outside and decided to wheel the empty wheelchair to an area with seat.

An older nurse stop me and ask that I placed the wheel chair outside. I said my grandma still wants to use the wheel chair as she’ll only be inside for a short while, but she still insisted I put it outside so everyone can use.

Can you for the love of god use your head and understand the reason why it’s a dumb idea to ask patient to put wheel chair outside the hallway? There is literally no wheelchair outside especially when there is a lot of visitors. Why do you think all of us are bringing the wheelchair with us whenever we go?

If I put it outside “for someone to use” and they take the wheel chair, I need to go all the way to the ground floor because that’s the only place I know where to get wheel chair. If my grandmother alone came here, she put out then how? Can’t find the wheel chair and ask her go all the way first floor to get?? If my grandfather came instead, he need go all the way to the first floor. You only want young people to accompany patient is it?

Trouble another nurse to get wheelchair all the way from first floor? I’m sure they don’t exactly know where to find wheel chairs either in the other floor. It’s near impossible because I also had to find wheelchair in the other floor before.

You know I’m honestly applaud and offended, like if this was my grandmother I don’t think she even knows where to find the wheel chair after she put outside. And is it even necessary to tell us this? If you have limited wheelchairs I understand, but I visited the hospital and there are numerous wheelchairs outside the entrance ground floor. It comes off as a little too insensitive and stuck up. Also why am I the only one who was told this?? She never even tell the other older visitors who are accompanying the patient. When my mother came to me she immediately stop what she said and left?? Just because I’m a young person doesn’t mean I won’t put up a bad review or complaint.",2025-07-08T09:30:50.875Z,healthcare,True,Excessive punctuation,442,2337

3 of us came down, they said that there’s a limit of 2 visitors but we aren’t visitors are we? We’re here to pick him up and go. So nurse told one of us to go collect medicine first at L2 pharmacy.

At the pharmacy, registration told us that the doctor ordered duplicates - we were confused, what were we supposed to do with that information? Sat down and waited for more than 1 hour. The whole pharmacy cleared out already except for us. The counter staff kept looking over at us but not a single one asked for our queue number. Until I finally went to ask them and turns out they were waiting to ask the doctor WHY there was a duplicate. The doctor had them on hold for an hour and they didn’t tell us anything. This is so perplexing. I get that its protocol or wtv to confirm again but the lack of communication is crazy.

Sengkang General Hospital,1,"I'm very disappointed @ their Emergency centre. The waiting time displayed was 2 hours max. However, tell me why even after 5 HOURS waiting in Acute Care, I'm still not attended to after blood test & 2 IV drips. I came @ around 5PM & walked out @ around 11PM. The nurses there are not attentive that my blood was even flowing down the tube when the last IV drip was done, it took another nurse from another section who passed by, to nudge one of them to do so. The nurse who did my blood test & IV drip wasn't around, probably changed shifts at that point of time. My throat already hurts as I keep feeling something @ my throat as if it were swelling/tightening & get nauseated easily when I open my mouth to yawn especially even after the IV drip. Keeping my hand raised & constantly looking for eye-contact with anyone of the nurses wasn't enough. After 5 hours of waiting I couldn't take it anymore & asked one of the male nurses, telling him I want to go home as it's been 5 hours of waiting & I haven't eaten or drank water THE WHOLE DAY because of my issue with swallowing, my mouth was very dry.  I could barely speak, it was very uncomfortable to get words out. Apparently patients have to inform nurses to leave as they need the tags, so tell me why, when I informed him, he just told me to wait some more for the doctor & that I can move to the waiting area OUTSIDE??? I insist on going home, they need to help me take out the needle but nope, I was ignored. As I turn to see a group of nurses at the entrance of Acute Care laughing about with one another, I could sense my panic attack coming & feel nauseated all over again. I looked at the clock @ around 11PM I got up & walked out of the hospital. Guess what? I did start to vomit & have a panic attack when I reached home, I went to private hospital instead. I haven't gone to SKH's Emergency before so I had expectations that they would be more efficient than CGH at least because it didn't look as crowded & my previous experiences of attending appointments @ SKH was good last year, 1 hour max. Why does the Emergency centre does not feel like an EMERGENCY at all? They only gave me a call at around 12AM & that was when I was vomiting & having a panic attack! I looked at my blood test record on HealthHub app & it says that they received it around 7PM & reported around 8PM. I understand that there were other patients to attend to, but 5 HOURS without food or water the whole day is really ridiculous & I keep seeing patients who came after me (have been attended to & ready to leave). I'm so disgusted that they didn't even adhere to my request to leave, I took out the tag & left it there, took out the needle at a private hospital. Thanks a lot to the group of nurses having a great time laughing @ 29/07/2025. I sat near the CCTV, not sure where the camera is facing but they can review themselves. Very disappointing, looks can be deceiving. If SKH looks less crowded than CGH? Doesn't mean you'll get attended to faster.

Alexandra Hospital,1,"Now reading this hospital's low ratings and the complaints, i feel better knowing i was not being critical. There is a reason why this hospital has such a low rating and reputation

Below is an exchange of what the main issue was after i was admitted and discharged from alexandra hospital. A cyst in liver was found but doctor jeanette ting did not mention a thing during the bed visit. I only found out during discharge which sent me into a panic when i saw i have an appt with the hepatobiliary and an ultrasound scan. After going home i got an sms asking how was my experience with AH and thats what made me thought this hospital cares to know, how wrong i was!!!

i approached the customer service AH_feedback@nuhs.edu.sg but doctor jeanette ting insisted on speaking on the phone instead of answering the questions in the email. So there was this lady named Joyce Tan in ""Patient Experience Matters"" being the middle person to pass the email message from doctor jeanette ting (see below exchange). There is a serious lack of accountability, and when questioned, they avoid admitting mistakes, and even cut further communication. When i requested for this doctor not to attend to me in future admissions, the fake nice lady Joyce Tan from AH_feedback@nuhs.edu.sg (where PATIENT EXPERIENCE MATTERS) then says ""we will disengage further communication on this matter."", dismissing my experience like i made it all up.

Qn) why no mention of cyst in liver n the followup appt during bed visits? I only found out abt this when i saw discharge paper stating hepatobiliary appt in july, which left me shock n confused, no word was mentioned by MO nor main doctor during bed visits on 22apr after my ct scan on 21apr

Ans from DR) During the ward round on 22nd April 2025, team had noted CT urography showed a liver cyst and the plan was for an outpatient ultrasound liver followed by appointment with the hepatobiliary (HPB) surgeon. Ward MO was to inform you about this. However, you were given the discharge documents by ward nurse prior to MO informing you about the liver cyst and plans for HPB follow up. Prior to your discharge, ward MO spoke to you about the liver cyst seen on CT urogram and the plan for outpatient ultrasound liver and HPB follow up thereafter. Ward MO had addressed your queries and you had no further questions.

Ans from me) On the 22apr morning when MO dropped by before Dr Jeanette, no mention of liver cyst. When dr jeanette finally came by, there was only mention of kidney cyst which i SPECIFICALLY REM we had a bit of a discussion on it about the followup with urologist was for the kidney cyst. NOTHING was said abt liver cyst!! Around 230pm when i got the discharge letter the appointment list mentioned hepatobiliary appt thats when i asked nurse to check for me what that was about, MO came and admitted it slipped his mind. And dr jeanette also said nothing abt this too! I never want to question further on this overlook even though i feel it is grossly negligent to not inform me as a patient on the discovery , i could have raised question by the bed. So when I penned this feedback i decided to mention this because it seems more negligence were experienced after looking back I want to reiterate that MO ONLY told me AFTER I QUERIED on it, i am a patient not a doctor, it is not my duty to make sure doc share with me my test results if i am not aware of it. So when your reply on this qn appears like they addressed it with me i felt like there was no accountability on their part to acknowledge they did overlook.

Final reply from DR) Please note that we will not be revisiting questions that have already been addressed. We maintain that there has been no negligence on our part in your care. If you have any new concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out.",2025-05-09T08:37:58.185Z,healthcare,True,Excessive punctuation,688,3806

Atlas Associates Clinic - GP Clinic in Singapore,1,"I had a visit with a GP.
After reading many positive reviews about the clinic, I chose this one. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a mistake!!!!!
The only positive thing was the very kind ladies at the reception.
It started with the fact that I had an appointment at 9:20, but I didn’t enter the doctor’s office until 9:45. Even though from 9:30, there were no other patients in the room or in the clinic—just me.
When I finally entered the office, the doctor, with an unfriendly expression (though perhaps that’s just his normal look), asked me what he could help me with. I explained that I’ve been treated for Hashimoto’s for 12 years, and for the past two weeks I’ve had symptoms indicating something is wrong with my thyroid – in other words, my dosage is likely too low. I asked for blood tests: TSH, Anti-TPO, Anti-Tg, FT3, and FT4.

First, the doctor sent me to the room next door for an EKG. He read the result as a heart arrhythmia and told me to go to the emergency room immediately, saying they would run the tests there. First of all, I’m a physiotherapist myself and I know how to read an EKG – and there was nothing alarming on it. Secondly, both of my parents are doctors. I sent them the result and they confirmed there was no arrhythmia, and that my symptoms as well as the EKG clearly point to hypothyroidism. This is basic knowledge that a GP should have. I also sent the result to my endocrinologist, and she literally laughed that a GP could make such a mistake in reading the result.

I do not recommend this clinic. I wasted half a day, didn’t take my thyroid medication, and didn’t eat breakfast – all because someone was incompetent and showed a dismissive attitude toward the patient. I should also mention that I was there with my 3-year-old son, and the doctor seemed shocked that I brought a child with me to the appointment. And one more thing – I find it unbelievable that someone would examine a patient through their shirt!

I absolutely do not recommend this clinic to anyone!!!!!!!",2025-04-07T01:29:38.091Z,healthcare,True,Excessive punctuation,366,2018

PanCare Medical,1,"Very very bad experience and will never go to that clinic ANYMORE!!

The clinic assistant asked me to wait because she want to settled the precriptions, so I wait. Understand that shes alone there. After she settled the precription, She called the patient, ok I understand. She didnt ask me to sit, so I stand. Atleast asked me to sit, later will call me, NOPE. She make me stand there almost 10mins!!

After she settled the patient, she sit on her chair and ask me, 'you have singpass? So I say have.' But I want to give you physical IC and my fullerton digital card from my phone. I showed her but she refused to take. She ask me to wait again because Im the new patient. Stand there again make me LIKE A FOOL!! Then she do the second prescription? What is this?? Is this the service that you give to your new patient??

Doctors please take note.

Very dissapointed.

I just shifted house that area. And I have to asked my husband to drive me go other clinic.

Hopefully other branch will not have this experience that I go through.

Pier Medical Centre,1,我是看到诊所外面挂着X光诊所招牌而去体检的，结果去的时候人家说没有X光服务了，说可以在他们诊所看医生然后去别的地方照X光。我是早上9.15分左右到达诊所，排名第三位但护士没有给排队号码，大约10点左右，轮到我的时候，护士既然跳过去叫第四位先进去看医生，我问护士为什么没有按顺序，她随口一句不就差一个人嘛! 后来我咨询别家诊所抽血化验和X光收费才知道比别家诊所贵大约50%! 综合评价: 速度慢 态度差 收费贵!,2024-04-09T00:09:21.864Z,healthcare,True,Too few words (6 < 10),6,205

Meridian Medical Centre,2,"Updated review after clinic’s detailed explanation:
This clinic doesn’t offer subsidised vaccination pricing as per MOH subsidised rate guidelines despite booking via MOH site, so it’s definitely pricier than normal. Based on clinic’s explanation, only selected clinics may offer subsidised vaccination, and some may charge consultation fees. Maximum price for flu vaccine per MOH guidelines is $70 (based on clinic’s explanation) and that was what was charged & paid. Do check before heading over as we’ve had to pay almost 2x the price compared to other clinic. Other clinic only charged my family member $38 btw.

MAJOR REGRET not checking.

Update after seeing Dr Tang’s reply:
We did show Green CHAS card to the staff, but was still told there’s no subsidy at all (only CHAS chronic card is entitled for discount) even though MOH and Vaccine.gov.sg states that with Green CHAS card will be $35. We also booked the flu vaccine appointment via MOH’s website click through, assuming it’ll direct us to clinics under the same pricing scheme but had a rude shock when a nearby clinic from home charged my other family member $38.15 while this clinic charged us $70. Not sure where the discrepancies are or if this clinic just doesn’t offer subsidised rates per MOH’s guidelines. Still unsatisfied as we did not get any clear explanation as to why there are price differences. The staff only mentioned “this is our clinic pricing, only CHAS chronic is entitled to staff discount”.",2025-02-12T07:27:26.713Z,healthcare,True,Promotional content detected,244,1479

After years of dodging dental visits (thanks to a nightmare experience at another clinic—think horror movie vibes), I was terrified to the max. But Dr. Caroline and Nurse Ruby treated me like a nervous little baby, and I mean that in the best way! They guided me through my first X-ray, patiently answered all my silly questions, and somehow knew exactly when I needed to rinse or spit. Dr. Caroline is incredibly knowledgeable, warm, and reassuring—she’s officially my favorite doctor ever! The entire staff in the clinic was so friendly and welcoming, I felt like I was among friends. Dr. Caroline for life! Highly recommend this amazing team! 1 gazillion stars for all of you! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",2025-07-23T05:49:59.659Z,healthcare,True,Excessive punctuation,138,808

Noble Dental Surgery @ Yishun414 - KEYHOLE IMPLANT SURGERY & NOBLE SMILE ALIGNER CENTRE,5,"My 1st time going to Noble Dental Surgery at Blk 414 Yishun.And was attended by Dr Lisa.
Had ny filling done on my right tooth which had a huge hole which cause so much discomfort when eating and drinking.

Dr Lisa is so patient and very gentle. She answered all my queries on getting her advise of what to be done for my teeth and also answered my queries on the payment method for the procedure.

During procedure Dr Lisa make sure that my affected teeth and gums are fully numb to make sure that I wont be in pain during the process.. She checked on me for quite number of time to make sure I am ok before she proceed with procedure…

Lastly,I love the filling procedure that she did as she used a white filling rather than the normal black or greyish kind that was normally used by other dental making my teeth look normal again without  looking gross with those coloured patch on it.

Thank u Dr Lisa!!!!!!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THIS DENTAL TO ANYONE WHO NEED DENTAL CARE!",2025-08-04T07:12:43.541Z,healthcare,True,Excessive punctuation,180,973

CC Tang Dental Surgery Pte Ltd,1,"My first visit many years back was decent thus I rated them 5 stars previously. Recently visited them again after I spotted a cracked tooth. Exactly like my first visit, dentist self promoting his skills and explained why he charged a higher fees when they are not being asked. As quoted from him, what you pay is what you get. Was told its gonna be slightly over $300 before I agreed and proceeded with the treatments then having asked to pay $630 over the counter and not been given a receipt for the breakdown of treatments after paying twice the initial amount.

Conclusion, dentist is an arrogant scammer who is also rough during treatments. No wonder he hardly have any visitors and his female assistant kept calling to reassure my appointment, fearing that if I don't turn up and they would lose a scam victim",2025-05-04T08:52:37.510Z,healthcare,True,Promotional content detected,145,816

CC Tang Dental Surgery Pte Ltd,5,"BEST DENTAL CLINIC IN WOODLANDS!!!

I just had a wisdom tooth surgery yesterday and it turned out way better than expected. Doctor was able to locate the source of my problem in the first visit and recommended the best approach to resolve the matter. Turns out it wasn't my wisdom tooth only causing the pain but the teeth in front of it. You can sense that the doctor has years in experience by knowing the problem in a matter of seconds.

Surgery turned out great with minimal discomfort. There was close to zero pain after the surgery. Aunty at the reception will be with you throughout your journey, from consultation to post-surgery. I was being taken care of very well. Which dental clinic checks in on you daily and send you reminders to take your prescribed medication and what to do? Only CC Tang Dental Surgery. A big thank you to both doctor and aunty for making this journey less scary and memorable.

PS: Appreciate both of your naggings on how to clean our teeth properly and visit the dentist yearly!!!",2024-02-25T06:52:24.012Z,healthcare,True,Excessive punctuation,181,1017

57 Medical Clinic (Yishun),1,"If you can avoid this place, avoid it. Firstly, the wait time is ridiculous even if you make appointment. I had appt at 6pm for covid vaccine and only got out of the clinic at 730pm. Secondly, their queue system is weird. I was holding number 7 and after 6, they called for 8. I asked the receptionist why skipped my number, she said, ""Ohz I thought you are not here."" Does that even make any sense? Thirdly, the receptionist is very insensitive. During my wait there, I could hear all the medical issues of other people being broadcast loudly by her. ""What's wrong with you today? Diarrhoea ah? How many times? Oh, 5 times ah?"" Or ""You want receipt ah? Claim your $5 from company is it?"" The lady was so embarrassed to get her receipt after that.

Minmed Clinic (Punggol Coast),3,"Visited this place twice and both afternoons there were no other customers. Its location is good and near to the interchange, and the mall just above the MRT. Sadly, the health screening results were unusual, different from my regular screening. When asked, doc explained it could be due to non fasting blood. Strange they promote blood tests with no need to fast. The blood pressure was also left out, and abnormal results were obtained in the report. Usually my other clinic would ask to repeat if slightly off and the second reading would be accurate. This time round I went back for view and the blood pressure was ok again. It was good that the doc explained the screening results very clearly though. I probably won’t return to this clinic. 😅",2025-07-15T08:10:19.878Z,healthcare,True,Promotional content detected,131,748

Minmed Clinic (Yishun Ring),1,"Part 2/2

3) After the blood test, which was HPV test, its a cervical check or something which may need the doctor to check the inner part of vagina, which need to use a tool to open up the vagina. The doctor asked my wife to ly down, head on the other side of the bed, then put the tool in, but cannot seems to work out, then the doctor ask my wife to ly down, in the opposite direction which was instructed to do so, then put the tool in to open the vagina, then half way or so, the doctor cannot really check or something, then stopped, and ask the assistant outside to come in just to hold the light for her. My thing is why is it that you can't just ask the assistant to come in at first! And why the doctor keep on finding all the tools and materials in the consultation room, and ask the assistant to find also? Where is the professionalism standard? How can the doctor make a patient like endure this kind os service standard? My wife wanted to complain but i hesitated as i think it's just our luck.
4) Today, which Sunday, 17/8/25, the clinic closed at 1pm, my wife collected her first faeces sample and prepared the kit, i drive down to the clinic at about 12.35pm, the male assistant from the clinic told me that they cannot collect as the collection team has already left. He told me that i may just call before coming down, i asked the assistant is it my wrong that i never call, and proceed down? He told me maybe it miscomm, which i totally dont agree!!! I told him too. On the very first day when we collected the FIT test kit, the clinic assisrant told us to bring down the 2 test kit, on 2 different days, during their opening hours!!! Which i did exactly what she said, and now, another clinic assistant told me the collection team left, and he cant do anything. So i have to dispose the kit, and re do and send it another day!

MINMED CLINIC, this is not the service standard we are expecting!!! All your staffs are changing here and there and this is the reason that you can use to protect yourself from our feedbacks??

I can't accept it and have to write this reviews. And i think this will need to go to the relevant department beause its government subsidies screening. And i dont want other to think that government subsidies screening lack of service standard, which caused by you all!!!!!",2025-08-17T05:40:14.416Z,healthcare,True,Excessive punctuation,440,2317

Halley Medical Clinic,1,"Dear Khay Mun,
I've read all the reviews and almost 99% are unfavourable ! Yet,  your standard reply is we are doing the best we can for our patients?!
I think it's you that are to be blamed for such sub standard or minus zero service rendered at this particular outlet.
I totally agreed with all the negative reviews cos I've frequent there myself. The counter staff are so listless( except 1 or 2).A particular malay staff looks so menacing like patients are the Problems! She never speaks a word and if looks could kill......She certainly takes the cake! How in the world can you ppl have such staff mending the counter.  A visiting sick patient will become totally SICK when met with such staff.
When I  asked to speak to a Supervisor I was told she is  not in. ( time: 1630hr ).
The negative comments about your counter staff dated as far as 4 yrs ago and it still persisted this very day!
Like I've mentioned, it's you that should be held accountable for such unpleasant visit by the patients/customers. Don't just paste and copy dispensing standard apologetic replies.
Get up your fat chair and go down and observe this outlet yourself posing as a customer and you will realise what we meant!
The service is Apalling or simply put it Non Existence !!
Shocking and Baffling !!
Sincerely,
Gary lee",2017-03-23T11:16:20.963Z,healthcare,True,Excessive punctuation,233,1302

He is now hospitalised due to your stupid act doc david!!!!!!!! If you’re not sure, you could just refer my dad to A&E instead of just giving wrong medication….

Secondly the 2 female staff at counter.. they treated my dad so badly, chase my dad out like an animal???? IF HE CANT SIT AT YOUR CLINIC, THE LEAST YOU COULD DO IS TO TELL HIM NICELY INSTEAD OF SHOUTING LIKE MAD DOG….

the only reason why i even visited this clinic is bcs its near & convenient but aft encountering his rude consultation for the third time, i rather travel a little to get a better consultation with a more professional doctor.
1. place his stethoscope on my chest & back in my shirt through my collar without permission & female assistance.
2. told me off about my own description of “migraine” & insist that my one sided, throbbing pain &  nausea feeling that i’ve been experiencing for quite awhile is not migraine. he “educated” me by saying, unless i have a close call to stroke or “see the time wrongly” then dont use the word migraine & to just call it headache (?????????).

i dont think i need a phd to know that the pain in my head is migraine & esp when other doctors themselves has been describing it as migraine to me… Visited the clinic simply for meds & to obtain MC but instead got unnecessarily educated. not visiting to get my phd Dr Goh :)",2024-10-16T01:50:13.632Z,healthcare,True,Excessive punctuation,188,1013

Family Dental Centre Victoria Rivervale,5,"WOW!!! hidden gem!! in my 25 years of living, i have never had such a comfortable and swift experience with a dentist. growing up i always had a fear of dentists due to poor techniques used. i've been staying in sengkang for nearly 10 years but only discovered this clinic recently. i went in for a chipped tooth as my tooth was badly decayed and was attended to by the most patient Dr. John Kiew and Huda who was super caring and patient every step of the way. they could tell how anxious and jittery i was due to prior bad experiences, but was reassured every step of the way.

for the first time in my life, i had a pain-free filling!!

Dr. John also advises on potential dental problems that one might face, which is really helpful as dental problems are always discovered too late. thank you so much for the great experience here and i'll be sure to come back! :)",2025-04-01T15:42:19.433Z,healthcare,True,Excessive punctuation,163,868

Woodlands Health Campus,1,"It was a terrible experience, the financial consult over the phone versus what i had to pay was ten times the difference!!!  The financial consult on the 3rd floor was a joke!!  Spent 15 mintues sitting there while she tried to figure out how much. Mine is a straight forward case, referred by Poly clinic, 100% subsidized and a Singaporean.

I had asked for an estimate but was wrongly advised over the phone!  I was caught off guard at the huge bill!  I should have said NO but  I was at the hospital for the appointment!

On top of that, after 2 weeks the bill is still not out! I tried without sucess to find out the course ofthe review after the minor ops but was told that there was none!!! Hospital should not start to operate if they have not figured out their billing process.

I really regret going there! would definitely not choose to go there!  Please be careful!",2025-08-14T08:29:54.486Z,healthcare,True,Excessive punctuation,161,876

T Medical Clinic (Canberra),1,Doc was okay but the staff was really unbelievable. I understand I’m sick so I’m cranky naturally but I try not to put it on other people bc obviously it’s a me problem. But the one taking my registration was really something. Zero customer service. I presented you my CHAS card and you ask me if I’m Singaporean? Isn’t CHAS card only presented to Singaporean. Not even PRs? Then you took my temperature but don’t have the decency to show it up to my eye level? I have to crouch down to YOUR level to see it? You can’t even tell me my temperature? Is this how you are dealing with sick patients? No ounce of compassion?,2025-04-24T05:17:29.491Z,healthcare,True,Excessive punctuation,117,619

My 8 yo girl visited the clinic 2 days ago and claimed she was having a sore throat and viral fever. Doc did not prescribe any throat inflammation meds but said it was normal ! total waiting time Was at least 3 hours! . 2 days later fast fwd her throat is so hurtful and we called in to ask for kids lozenges, they asked us dropped by. I came down now and they claimed not sure whether can give us when I asked for syrup since the lozenges is meant for ADULT which they did not convey again! This time I asked what is the waiting time counter Indian guy said wait I asked isit another few hours wait again he kept quiet! 20 mins later I approached to ask again the medicine was just right NEXT to him!!!! Dunno what I was waiting for again!! I asked him since there’s no Q no. How I know what was I waiting for ?!!!! Could be another 3 hours again!!! His bad attitude immmediately showed asking whether I still want the medicine!!!! As if I was a beggar for the meds !!! My girl needs it but it doesn’t mean we had to beg for it !!!!!

Edgedale Medical Clinic,1,"i really want to give this clinic a 5-star review because the receptionist and one of the doctors (morning shift as far as i know) is very very kind to me and my children.

i brought my daughter to the clinic last week Tuesday as she had two spots near her mouth, which i suspected the start of HFMD. first and foremost i was there at 6pm, on the 15th July. he was late but me and my daughter still wait patiently and quietly. during the consultation, the Doctor, Dr Ryan Ho, dismissed us and seemed in a hurry. i asked if a memo was needed but he asked me to monitor further. so i was like hmm ok....

i came down again one the 22nd (Tuesday too) around 11am after fetching my daughter from school as she seemed to have an unknown allergy; started by hives on the side of her left hand then spreaded to legs and was itching everywhere. it was the first time and no one in my family had any history of allergies so YES i didn't know what to do. the attending doctor (which i didn't take down his name, urghhhh i wish i could give credits to him because he is by far the best doctor that attended to my children) prescribed me the flu med and calamine lotion. she stopped itching, which i am thankful for but yesterday i noticed that my daughter's body had red heaty patches. today, it surprisingly come and go. her Teacher even updated me that her right cheek went red after a waterplay activity but when i fetched her, there wasn't until i reached home and her cheeks went unusual red again. she was itching her hands so i decided to bring to the clinic. and yes it was Dr Ryan Ho.

i felt belittle and felt that he doesn't bother on checking on my daughter giving the doubting face expressions even through the mask. all i want to find out was if it was caused by the allergy rash, and what should i do as i believe if the rash persists, i should come back?? he really just went ahead and asked me ""is her face red now? is it itchy now?"" to which i replied not now, but before we came over she was itching and it was red, it comes and goes. he simple said she need to just eat the flu meds. ALSO not to forget he even gave an example of ""if i allergic to seafood, just eat the flu med first then eat"" - what kind of advice is this? that’s horrible advice for a child with suspected allergy, especially when the trigger isn’t even identified yet. for a child that's 2 years old? you'd want me to jeopardise my child just like that? so why can't people with allergies just eat the flu med and that'll make the world a better place i suppose??

proceeded to ask me how often i washed the bedsheet and soft toys to which i replied every week. and his response? ""you just need to improve what you're doing now"" excuse me which part of ""come and go"" do you not understood? i couldn't take it when he laughed it out when i told him ""thing is i don't want them to rely on medicine too much"" and he went off with ""no choice you know you allergic you eat medicine"". at this point i was feeling crappy. i felt like i wasn't heard. i am a disappointed mother i don't even know what guilt i have - to come to that clinic or that i can't find the answer to my daughter's allergy.

i went out, made the payment and stood my ground and talked to one of the male receptionist (didn't get your name but i really appreciate your listening ears and how kind you are!) i cried while giving the feedback and yes it was tears of anger.

i don't wish to jeopardise on his position or job. before i wrote this in, i read the reviews and people are mentioning about him too.

i just hope we are really paying for what we are in to consult for. don't treat us like govt polyclinic with 20 people waiting for you lr consultation - even they do better.

thank you for reading. i hope this gets a response and i would love to know if this matter has been brought up to the upper management. thank you.",2025-07-24T15:11:18.631Z,healthcare,True,Excessive punctuation,755,3873

Raffles Medical Waterway Point,1,"Agree with the reviews here that they don’t dispense medication promptly causing unnecessary long waiting times. This was alr feedbacked years ago but seems like there’s no change of any kind.

The doctor told my MIL she (doctor) would wait for us parents (me and hubby) to arrive as the medication required quite a bit of instructions to prepare and wasn’t sure my MIL was up for complex instructions.

When we arrived, the doctor in the room told us (in the nurse’s presence), that the nurse will help to dispense medication and explain what to do. We said okay and looked to the nurse for the medication.

However, immediately when we were with the nurse outside the doctor’s room, the nurse’s first question to us was ‘do you still need me to tell you how to use the medication?’. We said yes, and she left us.

We were bewildered as just less than a minute ago the doctor told her clearly to do so and now she is asking us if she really needs to do it as though she didn't hear a single word that the doctor said.

Furthermore, wasn’t that the point of needing my husband and I to be present? That the medical staff wanted to explain the medication since they felt my elderly MIL was not up for it. Then why the change in attitude now and ask if we REALLY need her to explain?

Even after telling the nurse, ‘yes please do the necessary, explain to us how to use the medication as we have never taken it before’, she still refused to explain to us how to use the medication and continued to stall for time and busied herself with other things.

So she would ask us one question, walk away for 10 minutes, come back, ask another question, walk away for 10 minutes, and so on. You get the gist.

Some questions also have no reasons to take so long to process. We told her our son has no drug allergy, yet she walked away for 10 minutes. If there’s no drug allergy, what’s there to process and reprocess? She came back and commented we were waiting for the medication, have we taken it before? Either she has short memory or stalling for time as she kept asking us the same questions.

I understand that they have other patients to tend to, but who on earth asks standard questions one by one then take 10 minutes to process each question? Shouldn’t you ask all standard questions at one go?

I was starting to suspect she doesn’t know how to use the medication hence she kept delaying us and stalled for time. True enough in the end it was a different nurse who had to dispense the medication by then much time was loss for no good reason.

The whole place was such a mess.

The worse is my son needed the medication urgently. So for the nurse to do that was really unethical. Even after we gave the feedback, they didn’t get back to us but just simply told us to move on because it’s in the past.

I would like to ask then does it mean patients don’t have to pay for bills that are for past services rendered since they are already in the past?

I never went back ever since and other clinics like KKH have robust protocols and written instructions for parents to follow. Efficiency is much better at a small fraction of time and money spent.

My biggest regret was that my poor son was made to wait unnecessarily and the doctor then told us because we didn’t have the medication fast enough, there might be irreversible damage to his body.",2025-08-02T03:21:25.995Z,healthcare,True,Excessive punctuation,623,3344

Chung & Ee Medical Clinic,1,"The attitude of the nurses here is extremely poor, and they are very disdainful. It cost over $100 for a child to see a doctor, and we hoped to split the payment into two days, paying over $50 today and the rest tomorrow. However, the nurse was very disdainful and even used derogatory language. She speaks the Hokkien dialect ""SIAO"". Her attitude seemed to suggest that if we couldn't afford it, we shouldn't come to see the doctor at all.

We spent over $100 for a single doctor's visit, and all we wanted was to split the payment over two days. We haven't shortchanged you in any way. Why should we be treated with disrespect? Why should we be looked down upon? Why can't we split the payment for the medication over two days? And why can't we have an invoice for the medication on the same day it's given?

The nurse's attitude was extremely disdainful, and she used derogatory language. Her attitude seemed to suggest that if we couldn't afford it, we shouldn't come to see the doctor at all. Is this the way you treat customers at your clinic? Is this the style of your clinic? If that's the case, please understand that we really have a low opinion of your clinic!!!!

这里的护士的态度非常的糟糕，态度非常不屑一顾，孩子看一次医生花了$100多，我们希望分两次拿药，今天付50多，明天再付50多，但是护士非常不屑，还说福建话“ SIAO”，她的态度就是认为我们付不起钱就不要来看医生，看一次医生花了$100多，我们分两天付钱难道不可以吗？我们没有差你一分钱，只不过是分了两天付钱而已，难道就要被你鄙视吗？凭什么要被你看不起？为什么不能能分两次拿药，那每一次拿药为什么不能有当天的药的Invoice。护士非常不屑，还说福建话“ SIAO”，她的态度就是认为我们付不起钱就不要来看医生！看一次医生花了$100多，我们分两天难道不可以吗？我们有付款，我们也没有差你任何一分钱，只不过是分了两天付钱而已，难道就要被你鄙视吗？请问这个就是你们诊所的对待客户的态度吗？这就是你们诊所的Style？那如果是这样，请恕我们对你们的诊所的评价真的只有这样而已！！！",2023-10-10T06:27:07.423Z,healthcare,True,Excessive punctuation,217,1564

Northeast Medical Group (Buona Vista Clinic),1,"The experience with the front desk was pleasant. They are fast and prompt.

The experience with the doctor was another story. I was at the clinic on 25/2 (5pm) He looks younger than me but i have never seen a grumpier young man.

He interrogated me on why i was at this clinic rather than another clinic. I dont see how that is related to the condition I was at the clinic for. I told him nicely but he didnt seem satisfied with the response.

Maybe he woke up on the wrong side of bed. But i asked him if i could get a steriod jab for my hives outbreak. He told me that it only works for localized area. I told him that i had gotten it before 18 years ago for this condition. He told me that 'whether i get it depends on whether the doctor is willing to give it to you, and you can go travel until you can find someone willing'. Then i asked him, so does it mean i get the jab? He said no. But he said he can give me additional steriods. He said that he usually doesnt give because of side effects. Since there was side effects, i asked him, then 'should i even take?' He asked me, 'am i the doctor, or are you the doctor?' And 'if it wasnt worth taking it i wouldnt recommend it'. Then i asked him 'so what about the side effects?' he said 'anyway the side effects are very mild.' He started to look offended and cross.

I cannot understand this guy, im having anxiety from having rashes over my whole body, but when i ask him questions, he says contradicting things, that i dont understand what kind of point he is making, and when i ask him to clarify he makes defensive statements like that??

Then he looked at my record, and i can literally see his jaw clench. And he said, anyway you have everything that you can possibly need so im not even going to give you anything today. So what are you here for today??

I told him im having flu. He said ok, so cough, sorethroat, running nose? I say yes, but no cough. He said ok.

When i went out to collect medicine. I had cough medicine? I cannot understand this man. He just told me 'if you dont need it, i wouldnt recommend it to you' but here he is giving me cough medicine even though i told him that i dont have cough?

I told the front desk, then i stood there for a couple of mins. The front desk guy was quite nice. But nothing happened. I asked the guy what i was waiting for. He said, for the doctor to reply. I was like ???? I just dont need the cough medicine, why do i need to wait for the doctor? Can i go? He said ok and i left.

TLDR: Frontdesk is nice, doctor needs bedside manner training and possibly hearing check.",2025-02-25T10:08:57.270Z,healthcare,True,Excessive punctuation,509,2585

Clinic itself looks identical to a polyclinic, queue isn't as long but waiting time definitely is, waited 30 mins to an hour even though there were fewer than 10 patients waiting.

Young doctor is unfriendly and inexperienced...

BMTC School 4 (Rocky Hill Camp),5,"Tired of staying in the city center? This resort is the perfect getaway!

After a 1h transit from the far East of Singapore, you can disconnect from the world in a place where signals literally cannot reach! Let your mind and body recharge with the relaxing view of the rainforest for as far as the eye can see, and enjoy ready-made meals designed to optimize nutritional content! At night, you can enter a deep, peaceful slumber to the soothing sounds of machine gun fire and grenades.

There are plenty of activities to keep you entertained! From the concrete running track in the middle of an unsheltered field, to the swimming pool that is chlorinated on a regular basis, you'll find yourself in top physical shape in no time! You can interact with exotic wildlife, such as monitor lizards, centipedes, mangrove vipers and even king cobras! You'll also have plenty of abandoned buildings to explore at night, just don't get too friendly with any of the residents.

All these and more, for the low, low price of your hair, your NRIC, and your freedom. Book your stay now!",2025-07-03T04:34:27.627Z,education,True,Excessive punctuation,187,1074

Lumiere Montessori House @ Serangoon,5,"This is the most lovely school! Lumiere Montessori House strongly values the Montessori method within its educational practices and the teachers deliver it to the students in the most caring manner.

The school is very organized with attention to every detail including daily routines for the children, long term goals and mastery of all the essential preschool and kindergarten cognitive elements (numbers, letters, colors, shapes, animals, food items, reading, English and Mandarin, creativity, fine motor skills, gardening, emotions, self care, showing kindness to others, cultural exploration, and so many more!), frequent review/return of school work to display progress made, very thorough/helpful parent teacher conferences, relevant and fun field trips, and regular, real-time messages/updates to parents/families to share all of the joyful experiences at Lumiere. Every paper my child brought home was clearly labeled with her name and what she was learning when she created it, and the food and uniform items she took to school each day came back neatly with her every afternoon. As a parent, this diligence from an educational partner was so appreciated!

The teachers genuinely care about the students and support them fully to learn, grow, and be their best. They create a welcoming, patient, loving, and inclusive environment for everyone at Lumiere, which was like a second family for my child, where students of all ages are friendly with each other and even the youngest Nursery kids call their classmates by name!

My child was always happy to go to Lumiere each day, and I'm extremely grateful for everything Lumiere taught her and exposed her to. As a result of her time at this school, she has excelled from a very young age. I highly recommend Lumiere Montessori House! THANK YOU, Ms. Serene and the Lumiere teaching team!",2022-09-27T03:47:51.447Z,education,True,Excessive punctuation,293,1844
Lumiere Montessori House @ Serangoon,5,"Our boy started at Lumiere at the end of March 2022. Unfortunately, we did not have a good experience with an earlier school and we were a bit wary! But right from the start,  the teachers were very approachable, supportive and reassuring!  Within such a short span,  I can see noticable difference in my son in a lot of areas. For instance his communication skills- he is much more articulate, has picked up another language (sings Chinese songs),  is learning to interact slowly with other kids (which was very difficult for him ) and most importantly enjoys the pre-school experience itself!! He speaks fondly of his teachers and all the fun activities that they make him do! He is starting to make friends at school and looks forward to spending time there.  Thank you so much Ms Serene,  Ms Bridget,  Ms Yvone,  Ms Karena and all the rest of you for making such a positive impact on him in such a short span of time. From crying to go to his earlier school to actually looking forward to coming to Lumiere,  this is quite a shift!!
I can't wait to see how much more he will evolve over the next couple of years in his journey at Lumiere with all of your support.  Look forward to our full day partnership moving forward.  Heartfelt gratitude for all your care, support and nurturing! Hope that you can make a similar difference with many more kids and their families! For parents looking for an amazing preschool experience for their little ones, highly recommend Lumiere.",2022-06-06T01:42:25.087Z,education,True,Excessive punctuation,261,1477

Lumiere Montessori House @ Serangoon,5,"Lumiere Montessori House is a fantastic preschool!

From the moment i stepped into school, for the campus tour, i loved the environment! It was as though my heart found peace with a school that i can send my son to.

Just as a new mom, i was worried about sending Asher to a school for the first time. However, the teachers in Lumiere are unbelievable :) The way they showered him with love and care, i had no doubt that he was in good and safe hands!

We are always greeted with open hands and lovely smiles every morning and the teachers are always willing to have a chat with me when i need it.

Ms Serene, the school's principal, is awesome! She is so willing to hand hold a kid, not just during the start of school, but throughout the whole year. I'm so so impressed that she thinks for every student, notes down what she can do to help them grow.

This preschool is much more than a preschool, it's a family! The teachers are like moms to the kids! The school is full of infinite joy and laughter!

Asher had the honour of being part of Lumiere for one full year and our hearts are ever so grateful!",2019-05-24T17:32:13.570Z,education,True,Excessive punctuation,211,1105

Auntie is also very sincere, very real, that she allowed me to drink warm water, though she emphasized that the red date tea is still the preferred drink. Auntie also made her own brown rice ginger tea for me! As a tea lover, i absolutely love drinking this even though i only get to drink this as a late evening drink 😄 (though the best drink is still the red date tea)

Auntie Lilian treats my fam as her own; like steaming food for my 1st kid who has been coughing very badly; and its very warming to see. Auntie Lilian also shared her recipies with us, which i love her red bean pulut hitam dessert and brown rice and ginger tea and ginger milk drink🤤🤤

Auntie is also constantly learning and trying out new recipies and i am a happy food guinea pig😂 Auntie also showed me that i need not include any alcohol in my confinement diet to help me with my recovery, and i am happy because i do not drink (alcoholic drinks). I really enjoyed Auntie's cooking!

Auntie is really experienced, and i like that Auntie is constantly learning! Auntie told me about cold compression when i only heard of hot ones, and even reassured me on things i never experienced with my 1st born. I am happy as whatever auntie told me about my bb, was confirmed by the LC/PD.

Auntie also encourages latching and shares her knowledge willingly with us.

I like that auntie treats my boy like her own grandson :) So definitely thankful for auntie's help in taking care of both myself and my boy☺️❤️ even the massage massuese, from a totally unrelated company, commented that auntie Lilian is very good cos my bb seldom cried when she is here to do my massages! Auntie really loves kids 😊

Thanks Juztin for sending Auntie Lilian to us 🙏 and very glad to have extended Auntie's tenure with us and was thus able to enjoy more of Auntie's cooking and help in taking care of my boy and us😄 thank you Auntie Lilian for taking care of us❤️",2025-05-02T05:07:37.045Z,education,True,Excessive punctuation,423,2283

The Little House (Montessori),5,"息子がシンガポールに来てから小学校入学までの2年間通いました。園長のキャサリン先生が熱心に子供達に向き合っている姿に惹かれてこの学校に決めましたが、他の先生方も温かく、安心して通わせることができました。

息子は英語が全くできない状態で通い始めましたが、初めは先生達はジェスチャーやGoogle翻訳を使ってコミュニュケーションを取り、向き合ってくれました。そのおかげですぐに慣れ、毎日楽しく通うことができました。結果的に英語のコミュニュケーションは問題なく、中国語の理解も少しできるようになりました。

息子は特に週1回のクッキングとチーム対抗のレースを楽しみにしており、私たち両親も持ち帰る料理やレースの動画を観るのを楽しみにしていました。また、2週間に一度送られてくる写真付きのレポートや、ターム毎の先生との面談で、息子が普段どのように過ごし、成長しているのかよく分かりました。

The Little Houseは知り合いにもお勧めしたいスクールです。",2024-11-04T15:41:51.058Z,education,True,Too few words (6 < 10),6,429

The Little House (Montessori),5,息子と娘を通わせています。どの先生方も子供に愛情を注いでくれ、子供と常に真剣に向き合ってくれていると感じます。日本の幼稚園ではあまりない、丁度良い厳しさもあります。また2週間に一度送付されてくる子供の写真付きの生活レポートで、子供の様子を知ることができ大変参考になります。英語の全く話せない我々の子供に対して根気強く優しくサポートしてくれます。日本人駐在員の方にも強くお勧めできます。,2024-10-24T01:51:28.317Z,education,True,Too few words (1 < 10); Repetitive content,1,192

The Little House (Montessori),5,5歳の次女と2歳の長男が通っています。それぞれ2年以上、5か月以上通園しています。とても良い幼稚園です。日々の先生方のサポートとモンテソーリに基づいた教育で子供の自主性、表現力が養われていると思います。英語はフォニックスを学んでいるので安心です。中国語レッスンもあります。友人にシンガポールの幼稚園について相談を受けたら迷う事なく、The Little Houseを勧めますがその最大の理由は「安心感」です。優しさと情熱に溢れる園長先生と共に、豊富な経験を持つ先生方が子供一人一人に目と手を配ってくれている事が、至る所で垣間見えます。通園のスクールバスも含めてです。また、定期的に送られてくる個人の活動内容PDF(写真付き)は、園での雰囲気を把握したり、幼稚園での日常について子供と話すきっかけとして、とても役立っています。大事にデジタルで保管しておきたいと思います。入園前はいくつかの幼稚園も見学に行きましたが、The Little Houseに出会えて本当に良かったと感謝しています。,2021-08-09T15:54:05.875Z,education,True,Too few words (5 < 10); Repetitive content,5,444

Agora Colearning,5,"Aisyah and team are impeccable. We recently celebrated our son’s 1st birthday at Agora Co-Learning Space and honestly, we couldn't have asked for a better experience. From the very first message to the last moment of packing up, Aisyah went above and beyond for us.

The attention to detail was insane — every corner of the venue was thoughtfully arranged, the setup was beautiful, and the whole flow of the event was seamless. She helped us coordinate with vendors, gave honest recommendations, and even secured better deals for us. What really blew us away was how she handled things after the event too — one of the vendors arrived late (not her fault at all), and yet she still gave us a discount just to make sure we were happy. That kind of care is so rare.

Aisyah was also incredibly accommodating throughout the planning process. We had a lot of specific requests — from kid-friendly setups to ensuring the space worked for elderly guests — and she just handled everything like a pro. She even gave us a really fair and affordable package without compromising on quality.

And here’s the kicker: she’s pregnant and still stayed till the very end to help us pack up. We tried to stop her but she just smiled and insisted. Truly someone who puts her heart into what she does.

Thank you Aisyah and the Agora team for making our little boy’s first birthday so special. You really made our dream event come true. Highly, highly recommended — and seriously to the bosses, give this woman a raise!",2025-04-30T01:29:00.396Z,education,True,Promotional content detected,265,1500

Posso Preschool @ Jurong East,5,"Absolutely recommend Posso JE Infant Care! From the first school tour where we were introduced to Chen Laoshi, the in-charge for infant care, we were met with kindness, professionalism, and a genuine sense of care for the infants. The infants there looked so happy and it was so cute that they were welcoming to visitors too!

My boy was there since he was about 5 months old and everyday he is excited to attend school and we can really tell that he learnt a lot of social and developmental skills in school! Chen Laoshi leads a team of 4 other teachers who are all knowledgeable, attentive, and patient with our boy. It is clear they truly have a deep passion for working with infants, especially Chen Laoshi.

The teacher to infant ratio is about 1:2 or 3 at currently, the environment is warm, clean and comfortable for the infants, and there is even an indoor swimming/jacuzzi pool for the infants to enjoy! Whether it's feeding, sleep routines, or playtime, every detail is taken into consideration, and we can see the positive impact it’s having on our boy’s growth and happiness.

Communication is excellent too whether it’s daily updates, or quick responses to any questions we have, we always feel well-informed and reassured, especially by Chen Laoshi who really goes out of her way for the well-being of the infants.

Our boy has sensitive skin and is prone to eczema acting up, and the teachers have all put in extra effort and care to applying the creams for our boy diligently and making sure his skin is well maintained and clean.

Overall, we are truly grateful for the teachers' exceptional dedication. Our boy has promoted to Playgroup now and still misses Chen Laoshi, the teachers and friends over at Infant care! :D",2024-11-13T03:45:42.142Z,education,True,Promotional content detected,301,1737

Putting on clothes, doing simple Maths, write English letters, greeting others, drawing pictures, confidently giving speeches in front of class, doing performances, enjoying cooking, and much more. All these he learnt at Posso preschool. Posso focuses on cultivating children in all aspects. More importantly, Posso promotes children's interests in learning and respects their rhythm of learning.
Here, I am very grateful to the principal and the teachers who have taught our son, especially his English teacher Teacher Demie, Chinese teacher Hong lao shi and Lin Lao shi.

Modern Montessori Bukit Batok - MMI,1,"Very belated review.. If I can rate them zero, i totally will. My child was transferred here from another MMI during Covid,unfortunately rhat few months was the worst time of my child's pre-school life and for us too.
Firstly, principal n teachers didn't follow Covid rules of masking up. When asked, they gave ALOT of excuse n were very defensive.
Principal was obviously showing bias towards my child when we complained and she gave a super bad attitude to us and the child. What kind of educator does that!? We spoke to a few parents and they were also not happy with them (for their own reasons) but they decided not to pursue since their child has just a few months to graduation. Same for us, but it was too hard to bear.

Not going through long story here but since there were some issues with the principal, we went down to talk to her. she  spoke to us from inside the center, through the window. After while, said the kids were sleeping so she stepped out to talk but started shouting soon after n then stormed back into the center n slammed the door on us and left us standing outside the school! Seriously?? The principal?? Why did she do that? Because she couldn't defend her own mistakes anymore n decided to hide away?

We even spoke to head office and when we thought head office is making some actions, all they said was, the principal had been with them for many years.
So what does that even mean?? They said will speak to her but nothing came back to ua. Honestly, we were so upset that we even contemplated to go to ECDA but decided not to in case it affects my child.
Despite us not not bringing this further, the principal & some teachers showed prejudice towards my child. It's obvious in many little ways.

And I finally decided to review them after so many years, is because my child only recently asked me why did she change to Bt Batok & said she hated the school. The principal n a teacher would look at her and frown at her for no reason. The teacher even asked my child why is she frowning at the teacher?
Again, seriously??? Why would a child frown at the adult, if maybe in the first place, the adult frowned at the child??

If the principal or teachers have an issue with the parents, or they are not happy with the parents making comments or complains about their double standards, then please speak to us. They SHOULD NOT do that to a child, AS AN EDUCATOR. In the first place, if they had done right and not done double standards, there wouldn't be any issues for anyone. They are not even handling rhe situation as a professional.

In short, that short few months of school change was a TOTAL MISTAKE and it has totally ruined a small child's preschool life. In fact, it has ruined ours and our view of MMI too.

If any parents like to know the story, I'm happy to speak to you.
It's just too much to type here.",2024-09-24T13:51:32.048Z,education,True,Excessive punctuation,531,2849

数年後の本帰国を見据え、お友達同士の関わりは日本語中心で行ってほしかったこと、見学の際人懐っこく話しかけてくれた園児たちに魅力を感じ入園させました。良心的な価格と年少以降お昼寝がないことも重要でした。
7校見学した末こちらの園に決め、実際通ってみた感想は、「行事が多く楽しい！」です。
子供達は、ペーパー上でただ知るのではなく体験を通して季節を感じられていると思います。親が参加できるものも多く、ママさんのお友達も多くできました。
子どもとの接し方を見て、先生方の愛情も感じられますし、こちらの園でよかったと思っています。",2025-05-09T16:12:32.987Z,education,True,Too few words (6 < 10),6,323
Arts Junior Montessori Preschool,5,4歳の息子が1年間過ごしました。おかげさまで英語へ関心を持ちつづけることもでき、2ヶ月前にシンガポールを離れましたが今となり英語のアウトプットがどんどん溢れています。嬉しい限りです。そらから特徴の一つとして、音楽のクラスがありました。息子はあの楽器を触った！あの楽器をやってみたい！とても意欲的で驚かされました。子どもたちの発表の場が設けられた際には、ステージの上で堂々と振る舞い、のびやかに歌い、踊り、演奏をする、特に年長さんたちの姿にはとても感動いたしました。残念ながら卒園を迎えることはできませんでしたが、シンガポールに戻ることになりましたらぜひまたよろしくお願い致します。,2025-03-06T10:27:37.545Z,education,True,Too few words (1 < 10); Repetitive content,1,290

それぞれの能力や個性が尊重され、好きなことをのびのび、本人が納得するでやらせてもらえる環境がとてもよかったです。

Arts Junior Montessori Preschool,5,"３人の息子がお世話になりました。
園長先生は子供たちの事を一番に考えて下さるので、安心して通わせられました。私にとってはこれが一番のポイントでした。
そして、子供たちの自主性を大事にしてくれる園です。
長男は人見知りや拘りが強かったですが、嫌がることは無理強いすることなく、それとなく声をかけてくれていたようで、卒園するまで楽しんで通いました。
運動も積極的に取り入れていて、外遊びやプレイジムだけでなく、サッカーやバトンやバレエも希望すれば参加出来、息子はサッカーに参加して、毎回汗だくになるまで走っていたようです。
シンガポールのイベントだけでなく、日本のイベントも取り入れてくれるのでイベントが多く、子供たちは楽しそうでした。
これからも子供たちが楽しく通える園であってほしいです。",2022-03-07T13:55:58.406Z,education,True,Too few words (7 < 10),7,344

Learning Vision Nanyang Technological University,5,"Learning Vision @ NTU has a lovely environment and surrounded by lush greenery. The spacious building, complete with a playground and a beautiful grass patch, provides a perfect balance between indoor and outdoor activities. The cheerful teachers have made my son adapt wonderfully, giving each student ample attention. My son chose the 'Young Einstein' enrichment program and is always excited to show what he's created in class. The school hosts numerous events, from field trips to Parents' Day, and celebrates every religious holiday, promoting a rich sense of diversity.
My son learned a lot of things from this school. Eight months ago, when he started school here, he didn't even speak or understand Mandarin. Now he has a basic understanding of Mandarin and is happy to learn more. I appreciate the assistance and support given to my son during his time at Learning Vision.",2024-06-13T13:25:21.216Z,education,True,Promotional content detected,144,881

The teachers are very patient and loving towards the students. Teacher Chua who has been teaching my girl since the day she enrolled is very caring towards the students. Most teachers/assistant teachers here have been with the school for more than 5 years. Also, the food is prepared in house daily and my kids love the food as well. I have seen great improvement in my younger son ever since he attended My Little Kingdom.
There are also many outdoor activities/events organized by the school to promote school and parents bonding with the kids.
Today will be my girl's last day in My little Kingdom and she is very sad to miss all her friends and teachers as My Little Kingdom is like a second home to her.
Thanks for nurturing my girl throughout these years and pls continue to nurture my little boy as well.
Highly recommended to parents who are looking for a childcare preschool around this area as your little ones will be in good hands.",2023-12-29T02:11:02.972Z,education,True,Promotional content detected,195,1085

Eshkol Valley @ Sengkang Pearl Pte Ltd,5,"4 years is a long time for a 6yo! That’s how long My girl has been spending most of her life fruitfully thus far! While many focus only on the so call pedagogy and brand, few actually experience the fruits and returns from the most established of the brood.

EV@sengkang pearl is a rare gem that stands out among the lot. When we first moved to the neighbourhood, like most parents, the hunt for a preschool ( or rather, nightmare) begun. We were either put off or turned away by the overpopulated preschools in the northeast region and the journey was disappointing, to say the least.

But as if guided by divine direction, we stumbled upon the “land flowing with milk and honey”, or Eshkol Valley in the bible (confessedly, I missed that in my own bible studies..). I must say that the first tour-around experience was the best, not becoz of over-promising or any dazzling opulence to the exterior, but the sincerity, warmth and now well behaved the kids were! Definitely sending!

In the four years, I saw how my girl with some speech delays initially overcame her challenges and is now able to read Roald Dahl, Enid blyton!the improvement is stellar.

Like many, her Chinese was atrocious but the patience and high standards of coaching has prepared my girl for the rigor of P1 higher Chinese!

On top of that, she has gained confidence from being a quiet and shy little one to quite a “performer” and story teller!

Values impartation is the next most imp thing that EV has gifted  my girl. The teaching cohort in the school holds on to strong moral values and expect the same of the children as they guide them to make the right decisions and differentiating right from wrong, yet being kind and patient towards those who err.

4 years has gone by in a twinkling of our eyes, and now it is time to bid fond farewell. Knowing that she is graduating, she has refused to even miss a day of school. Farewell, her first teachers school and friends!",2021-11-18T03:57:18.393Z,education,True,Excessive punctuation,349,1949

Gladys Care 1987,1,"VERY Negative Experience with Gladys Care 1987 (Gladys Care)

My wife and I engaged Gladys Care 1987 (Gladys Care) for a confinement nanny in August 2023. We paid half of the agreed sum as a deposit. We informed the agency of our baby's expected delivery date (EDD) of March 20, 2024, and as per the contract, the nanny was supposed to be on standby one week prior to this date.

Upon admission to the hospital on March 20, 2024, at 4:30 PM, we promptly informed the agency of our imminent delivery. Our baby was born on March 21, 2024. However, the nanny only arrived on March 23, 2024, which was two days late. While we reluctantly accepted this delay, it was contractually unacceptable. The nanny was supposed to be on standby in Singapore, not in Malaysia, as the delay resulted in an extra night at the hospital.

During her tenure, the nanny’s service was causing worry, with her falling asleep during night shifts, causing distress to my wife. Despite these issues, we chose not to complain and worked directly with the nanny to ensure she got enough rest. (However, she is nice person and got along really well with us. She cooks well too and genuinely care for our baby! Shoutout to nanny Juliana, the one star i left on this review is for her!)

As the nanny’s term was ending on April 19, 2024, a conflict arose. The agency was demanding the remaining deposit, and we requested a discussion for a discount due to the nanny's late arrival. We held back the payment but never displayed any intent of not paying.

On the last day of the nanny's service, we were hosting a party at 7 PM to celebrate our baby’s full month. The nanny, whose shift was to end at 12 PM, informed the agency she would stay for the party and return afterward.

Meanwhile, we tried to reach the agency for a compromise on the fees, but Gladys did not respond.

At 6 PM, Gladys came to our unit, behaving rudely and accusing us of forcibly holding back the nanny and refusing to pay. Instead of engaging in an amicable discussion, she shouted at us and even involved the police, claiming it was her professional duty to ensure the baby was fine.

However, after the police left, no further checks were made on the baby, contrary to her assertion. Her actions ruined our party.

The police, after hearing both sides, found her unreasonable and acknowledged that she did not follow the contractual agreement. Although we paid the remaining deposit as she refused to negotiate, the police affirmed that we had the right to write a review or make a complaint to CASE.

Despite the distress caused by Gladys, we initially chose to let it go. However, we later discovered she had deliberately informed us late about the nanny’s work permit post-service process, resulting in an extra two weeks of work levy payment.

This was the final straw. To anyone considering Gladys Care, we strongly advise against it. Our experience, from the initial delay to the unprofessional and rude behavior of Gladys, was a nightmare. Even the nanny herself was shocked at the way the agent handled the situation.

For anyone looking for a confinement nanny, avoid Gladys Care / Gladys Yip at all costs. The stress and unprofessionalism are not worth it.

PS: This is only a brief description of the events. The intention of this post is merely to prevent other parents to be from encountering a similar ordeal. The reply to this review is twisted FYI. Engage at your own risk.  :)",2024-06-22T11:46:56.594Z,education,True,Promotional content detected,607,3439
Gladys Care 1987,5,"Background:
We hired nanny Jenny from Gladys agency for our first born baby. As we had no experience with baby care at all. We have a European background and the Asian confinement services were new to use.

Experience: outstanding/ superb (🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 5/5)
When returning home from the hospital, where my breastfeeding journey did not wanted to start properly, with our firstborn whom we did not knew yet (or fully understood): we arrived home and nanny Jenny was there! Immediately helping out and teaching us everything (as we are quite hands on parents we enjoyed being involved). Nanny Jenny has been our superhero throughout the journey! She has taught us everything about baby care, sleeping, soothing, bathing, feeding, caring, day and night routine, baby gym and so much more.

Nanny Jenny is very proactive, hands-on, solution oriented. When she noticed our baby struggled with Jaundice, our baby had sunbathing moments. When she noticed a blocked nose, it was immediately resolved. When our baby was a little older and he had long nails, she cut them. When our baby had cramps, nanny Jenny knew what to do. And there are many more examples.

Nanny Jenny has set us up for success with our firstborn. Because of her, we felt confident to take care of our baby, we felt we knew our baby, we understood his different cries and we had created a good baby routine. This would not have been possible without her.

Aside from that, nanny Jenny has helped me enormously in the breastfeeding journey. It was a painful journey and I would have stopped already without her. However, she knew all tips and tricks to make it more comfortable, to have less pain, to better latch the baby, to prevent bleeding nipples etc. And I am very thankful to her. As breastfeeding is a special intimate moment between mother and child!

Nanny Jenny is a very genuine, warm hearted, fun person. Aside from her 10+ experience in the baby care / confinement industry, she is also a wonderful person to have in your house.

Last but not least, Gladys services have been excellent. Aside from the nanny services, I went for belly wrapping massage and it made a big difference! During the massage, Gladys noticed my low blood pressure and recommended me a specific TCM tea. Which she bought for me and brought along to the next massage. This customized treatment is superb! Also I had a lactation massage, which has been such a relief ever since. Before of the massage my breasts were quite hard with a lot of knobs, and after the massage the milk is flowing with any hard knobs in there. Gladys has outstanding knowledge and really knows what she is doing!!

Thank you so much for everything!! I will contact you for my second child 🥰",2023-09-07T02:49:13.974Z,education,True,Excessive punctuation,471,2708

Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool at Ang Mo Kio,5,"We love Sunny Bunny Montessori! Excellent school with 1) strong Chinese curriculum 2) Outdoor playground (everyday!!!) 3) excellent teachers like teacher Maria, teacher Chavelle, 胡老师, 林老师 and many more teachers with long tenure and heart for the children 4) Montessori teaching which is 1 to 1 and helps the kids learn faster 5) very clean nice environment - our kid hardly falls ill.

My daughter didn't speak much when she joined at 18 months but now she can recognise Chinese characters and speak aplenty! We don't send her for any outside enrichment at all as Sunny Bunny has met all our needs! Best choice we've made for our little one's education! I hear that they now have infant care!",2025-04-17T10:32:54.165Z,education,True,Excessive punctuation,119,692
Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool at Ang Mo Kio,5,"Sending our 3-year-old son to Sunny Bunny Preschool has been one of the best decisions we've made as parents. The school's environment is nurturing, engaging, and designed to foster creativity and curiosity in young minds. The school team is incredibly supportive and attentive to each child's needs, ensuring a personalized learning experience.

What sets Sunny Bunny Preschool apart is its holistic approach to early childhood education. The curriculum is thoughtfully designed to balance academic learning with essential life skills, promoting social, emotional, and intellectual development. Our son has shown remarkable progress in his communication abilities, social interactions, and problem-solving skills.

Moreover, the school places a strong emphasis on parent-teacher communication, keeping us informed and involved in our child's learning journey!

Would highly recommend parents to consider Sunny Bunny Preschool as their child's early education!",2024-03-06T03:22:39.245Z,education,True,Promotional content detected,134,960

MindChamps PreSchool @ Punggol Digital District,5,上周五参加了学校组织的MRW workshop，在会议中Ms Katherine 给讲解了不同年级需要阅读那些绘本、阅读顺序（从左到右）、字母发音、单词拼写、高频词汇以及编写句子等，告诉家长在家可以通过游戏方式来和孩子一起学习单词，整个会议过程都很有趣，因为我家孩子是刚入园没有多久，K1的内容需要跟上，N2的内容也需要补上。会议后还向Ms Katherine 老师提出了自己孩子的知识弱点，Ms Katherine 老师特别耐心的解答并给提出宝贵意见。这次我们算是收获满满，接下来在家庭互动中准备实践一下，特别是通过游戏方式，特别感谢学校组织的MRW workshop，也特别感谢Ms Katherine 老师的耐心讲解。,2025-07-04T07:14:36.446Z,education,True,Repetitive content,11,312

COURTS Orchard,1,"Visited Courts Nojima on 3 August to explore buying a dryer. Did not expect it to be the start of many troubles.

Was wrongly advised by sales staff regarding the SG60 discounts ($120 off instead of $60) and use of climate vouchers for a dryer (cannot be used) only at the point of purchase. Decided to proceed with buying the Samsung dryer.

After purchase, did not receive any confirmation of notification of delivery of actual date, only a call 10 mins before delivery. Delivery window was 10am to 2pm, and ended up staying home for 3 hours (10am to 1pm) before getting a call that the delivery was coming. Sales staff also was hard to contact regarding delivery (2 to 3h wait, only responded after calling). Understand it was his off day, but Courts should have a staff to cover for him since it still involved deliveries, or have a more contactable number.

Sales staff also wrongly scheduled the Samsung delivery agent, so ended up the agent only came 1 day after the dryer was delivered. Asked for a specific time for the agent to come (3pm) to make up for the mistake but ended up with delaying my delivery window (originally 2 to 6pm) to 3 to 7pm. As of 545pm, the agent is still not here. (Edit: Agent ended up being late, and I was forced to take cab to my appointment)

This is one of my worst sales service to date, from pre to post sales. The only good things about this whole process was the advice given on the right dryer to buy (pre sales) and the free delivery given in an attempt to recover from the mistake in the supposed discount.

Please work on your service processes and sales recovery. It is alarming how poor the standards are.",2025-08-14T11:17:37.270Z,retail,True,Promotional content detected,303,1655

COURTS Clementi,1,"The unfortunate thing about being a young couple in our early 20s (and looking like a 19yo because of my height and baby face) shopping at an appliance store is that no staff will take us seriously. And that’s fine. BUT being rude and age discriminative towards us is just overboard.

Just to put it here that we have a BTO that’ll be ready in 2 years’ time. We happened to be at Clementi 321 and Courts is just opposite so we thought it’d be a good idea to drop by to take a look at the appliances for our future reference.

When we entered the store, a middle aged uncle staff wearing black spectacles already seemed very UNwelcoming of us. That was a bad start to our window shopping experience there.

While we were browsing the fridges, the staff just stood from far and observed us. Which was fine as this is a normal staff behaviour. But after some time, the same staff whom was standing far away, maybe 5-6 fridges away, SHOUTED at us aggressively “What you need help with???!” (please check CCTV and you’ll see exactly what I mean)

That made us really uncomfortable as he shouldn’t have shouted at us from far. Is it so hard to walk to our proximity and ask us if we need help, like normal, polite staff do? What kind of uncouth and unprofessional behaviour is this?

2nd incident that made me unhappy with the staff’s attitude was when I was filming the fridges and he stopped me and told me that I’m not allowed to film in the store. Really…? Then what about all the photos and videos posted on this Google review by other customers? Why was I the exception? Because I looked young and didn’t have the look of a potential buyer so I was not worthy to film the appliances?

I’ve attached a photo of the staff below. Unfortunately I didn’t manage to film his name tag clearly, but he was a grumpy looking middle aged uncle wearing black spectacles. Please identify him and give him a stern warning. I’m sure we were not the only customers who had a bad experience with him.

This unpleasant experience happened on 15 Aug, late afternoon.",2025-08-15T17:09:01.406Z,retail,True,Excessive punctuation,376,2047

bossini Downtown East,5,"Had a great experience at Bossini thanks to Karen at the Downtown East branch. She was very helpful when I was shopping for bottoms, explained the promotions clearly, and even told me about the ShopBack deal, which made my purchase a lot more worth it.

I also dropped an important card in the store, and Karen went out of her way to find me. When she couldn’t, she kept the card safe, and when I went back to look for it, she immediately returned it to me.

Really appreciate her helpfulness and honesty. Hope she gets recognized for her great service!l and integrity, which is true exemplar for every single person in the service industry.",2024-12-21T13:19:48.392Z,retail,True,Promotional content detected,115,641

- Quality and cloth materials don’t justify the price point

My wife purchased online and followed size guidance on the website but it still didn’t fit, so we checked for return or exchange, only to find out the items were discounted (might be because a promo code is used), so not eligible for return and even size exchange. Our fault for not reading the T&C first. But, also a TERRIBLE T&C for an online clothing store that sells at a high price point.

Skechers Punggol Coast Mall,1,"Feedback on Unpleasant Sales Experience
14 June, ard 2:45 PM

I visited your outlet on 14 June around 2:45 PM with my father, who was planning to purchase a pair of shoes. During the checkout process, I casually mentioned that the same item appeared to be cheaper on Shopee due to ongoing promotions.

The sales staff who attended to us a young Chinese female responded rudely and unprofessionally. She immediately remarked, “Shopee items are usually outlet stocks,” then took the shoes, threw them back onto the counter, and walked away abruptly leaving us standing at the cashier with no further assistance or explanation.

This kind of behavior is unacceptable, especially coming from a frontline staff member. As a large and reputable company, I believe you should place strong emphasis on staff training, particularly in customer service and professional conduct. Customers should never be made to feel disrespected or dismissed.

This is a sincere piece of feedback, not just for management to take note of, but also as a side note for the staff involved
""if managing your attitude or temper is a challenge, perhaps frontline customer service isn’t the right fit. Courtesy and respect are the minimum standards in any retail interaction"".
Otherwise stay home be princess!!

I hope this feedback is taken seriously and helps prevent similar situations for future customers.",2025-06-14T14:41:02.675Z,retail,True,Promotional content detected,222,1378

Mister Mobile (Hougang),3,"update: their customer service contacted me to do service recovery by offering to do the data transfer for free, but informed them i have already done it on my own. he then offered to send the on site team to come to where i was to assess my trade in phone instead of me going to the shop. So they did and handled my trade in at my office which was much appreciated. Feedback to them that training of the ground staff is important rather than to do service recovery for every case. I am happy with their proactiveness for service recovery though i know for sure i will be hesitant to step into their shops again.

very disappointing services. i whatsapp them to ask about purchase of a honor phone and trade in of my existing samsung, i asked to pay for delivery, but was told that if i want to trade in, i should go to their shop so they can help me with the data transfer.

i texted them to say i was heading to the bishan shop but they did not reply till i was already there, and was told by the sales they do not have stock for my model. i asked which shop have stock and was told hougang. so the next day, i texted and say i will be going to the hougang shop and they sent me a QR code but i still had to join the queue. I queued for about 30 mins, and was served. When I asked about data transfer, he told me i had to pay $30 for the services and had to leave my phone there for a few hours. he also mentioned honor phone and samsung transfers are very limited and comes with many restrictions. he asked me to just pay for the phone, go home do transfer myself, and bring back the old phone to sell. of course, the price quoted may differ by then,

my question is, if that is the case, why can't i just pay for delivery in the first place instead of wasting 2 hours travelling for all the fuss? not once on whatsapp it was mentioned they charge for data transfer or leaving the phone for few hours. i change my phone every year and every single time, the sales had ""offered"" doing the transfer without even me asking. neither did i have to pay anything.

This will obviously be my last time using their services.",2025-08-21T07:57:13.435Z,retail,True,Promotional content detected,416,2118

Bata,1,就在今天晚上5点多，我和我的儿子到了这里买鞋子。由于我儿子的鞋码比较大，我们就问店员有没有大一号的鞋子。我们全程都很客气，没有任何不礼貌。店员只丢下一句没有就和另外一个店员聊天。我觉得身为一个店员，就是要服务我们，要推荐我们鞋子。而且就是这个款式的鞋子没有这个鞋码，你明明可以好好的跟我说没有，抱歉表示礼貌，然后给我们推荐一个有这个鞋码的款式，可是你却只丢下一句没有就走开跟另外一个店员聊天。这态度明显就很有问题。我建议店家先把这两个戴眼镜的女店员态度端正了再为客人服务，不然贵公司会收到更多的投诉和不满的客人。,2024-06-02T10:35:28.930Z,retail,True,Too few words (1 < 10); Repetitive content,1,256

#NBD my first Tri Bike and new bike for 2024!!

Came to Tri Lab twice before for both my SL7 & Propel SL0. This time, my 3rd Bike Fit here comes with a new Bike!!!

Tri Lab had helped to make both my SL7 & SL0 more comfortable to ride on and of cos it would be the best place to go for my first Tri Bike.  CUBE Aerium TT!

Advise and recommendations from an Ironman + super-friendly staffs who are not pushy salesmen creates a welcoming environment where you can freely discuss your needs and preferences without feeling pressured to make unnecessary purchases.

This level of skillset and customer-centric approach makes it easy for me to trust their recommendations and make informed decisions about my purchases.

Thank you Tri Lab for the Great Experiences !!

Smartbed Signature @ Serangoon,1,"Update:
Delivery schedule for 11-Dec-2024, had issue with the delivery with no response from the team. Demanded us to pay prior to delivery, but when we check for order delivery before hand, the sales person is often no where to be found. Informed to contact their customer service and we call the number found online and on the receipt. However it was not in use and in turn blame us that we have dial the wrong number when it is printed on the company invoice without any amendment from the management.  Next, the bed frame is delivered wrongly. Still got the cheeky to argue saying that is we make the changes when clearly the printed invoice by the sales person is showing our choice written clearly. After 3 weeks of wait, on 1 Jan-24 we are being inform that the color we have chosen is no longer available and not sure need to wait for how long. So what is the team doing since 3 weeks back?

This is so frustrating and the ops manager still have to cheek to tell us to meet in person and is easier to resolve matter, however Mr Floyd Warren still have the cheek to demand us to make payment prior to delivery when the company is clearly at fault!!!

Malvin is very knowledgeable and experience in the product. He is exceptionally friendly and willing to help us in selecting all our new home needs.
Would highly recommend him to whoever needed furniture recommendation. Kudos!!!",2025-01-01T13:59:40.374Z,retail,True,Excessive punctuation,251,1386

Smartbed Signature @ Serangoon,1,"Bad bad bad bad bad!!! Please avoid buying from this shop! Terrible after sales.

Bought a sofa during their midnight promo sales. Everything was pretty smooth and good during the sales. However it was the post sales follow up and service that was appalling!!!

Expect 180 degrees change in attitude the moment your money is deducted and in their pocket!

The day the Sofa arrived to our place, we noticed silver pen markings (not small, big ones) all over the sofa, when we enquired and feedback, was told the markings were a normal part of the process??? This was bought as a brand new sofa, mind you, so it doesn’t make any sense for there to be such markings.

Their solution offered, send someone down to use some “Chinese oil” to try to wipe away the markings. Ridiculous remedy. Not only did it not work, now it made our sofa oily!!!

The markings are obvious and ridiculous and up till this day, the markings are all still glaring at me whenever I look at our sofa. Yet, their after sales best solution is that this can’t be helped and the markings are there to stay…

Never have I bought a sofa and have gotten such poor after sales and excuses.

If you want a brand new sofa without weird markings and writings, as if someone wrote stuff on it and all corners, then please stay away from SmartBed!!!

Be smart, learn from my mistake, stay away from them and their marketing gimmicks and you would have outsmarted them… 👌🏼👍🏻",2024-06-20T00:53:09.384Z,retail,True,Promotional content detected; Excessive punctuation,259,1433

T For Toys - Toy Store,5,"Great experience at this toy wholesaler! The prices are very reasonable, with most items being cheaper than Shopee. They have a wide selection of toys including puzzles, dolls, kitchen sets, costumes, party supplies, helium tanks, card games, board games, remote control cars, and even bootleg Lego/bricks.

The store is well-organised, and the buying process is straightforward. You just need to register on their website, scan the QR code of the toys you want, add them to your cart both physically and virtually, and then pay online. The friendly staff will bag your items for you once you're done, making the whole experience hassle-free.

It’s a great place to find affordable toys without breaking the bank, and there’s plenty of parking available. I went on a Sunday afternoon and parking was free. The only downside is that it's a bit out of the way if you're using public transport, but well worth the trip!",2024-09-15T07:32:29.234Z,retail,True,Promotional content detected,153,916

I have read a few negative reviews before I went down but it was a very welcoming and positive experience when I was there.

Just take note that you need to scan the qr codes to add the items to cart and check out with 'items collected' if you are physically at the store so that you won't get billed for delivery.

One visit isn't enough as I was circling the store for rounds and I will be back to shop more with my wife the next time round.

Also, thanks and kudos to keep the prices low and competitive....",2024-08-23T09:40:51.765Z,retail,True,Promotional content detected,129,656

Skechers Waterway Point,5,"Visited the store located at Waterway Point today. Was served by a Malay young lady
( sorry, I didn't manage to get her name). She was really patient when I shared previously I bought from the compass 1 outlet, and the shoes hurt me so much. She explained to me nicely that certain designs of shoes need to get 1 size bigger, so that is much more comfortable for me to wear. In fact, I only intended to get 1 pair, end up I saw there was a discount on 2nd pair for 50%. So, I asked her for an opinion and purchased 2 pairs. Thank you so much ☺️",2025-05-24T09:56:59.414Z,retail,True,Promotional content detected,110,544

"adidas Factory Outlet, IMM",1,"The visit encountered by my friends today (20/4/2025) doesn’t deserve even one star at all! Very poor service encountered with a prestigious international acclaimed brand! Big discounts can be found here , that explains why there is also a discount in their service attitude! I don’t mean to be nasty and post this but I am stating the facts here. Below is a feedback I gave to them :

Dear Team,

I’m here to offer a service feedback. My friends had went over to your outlet at IMM today afternoon  20/4/2025

Upon making payment, The service attitude of your 2 staff is totally unacceptable. Your staff did not ask if my friends are member or not. And the tone of voice of your staff used was unacceptable as it is very loud.

Is it that my friends are from China and your staff thinks that they don’t understand English and overlooked on the asking of the procession of your esteemed membership?

Or is the service standard at IMM outlet store  is of such as your selling price there is lower than other outlets?

This service attitude is truly unacceptable for such a prestigious international acclaimed brand of yours ! And this incident had already caused the mood of my friends for the day.

I would appreciate if you could have a reply to me of the course of actions you are going to undertake on this unpleasant shopping experience at your IMM outlet.",2025-04-20T12:02:00.918Z,retail,True,Promotional content detected,243,1360

Please do NOT purchase in future as there’s only a validity of one year. It is easy to overlook when you have many (young) children who stash these away. Cash is still king.

POPULAR Bookstore (HQ),1,Want to vomit blood. There is a promotion running for popclub members that enjoys 10% off when buying Pinocchio tickets by wild rice. Checked the popular app and couldn’t find anything. Called the members hotline at 4.46pm on 16 Nov. Was told that I can only find this promo code in the Nov/Dec magazine that is only available in their physical stores. Alamak which era are we in? The members department told me that this promotion is run by marketing and thus they don’t know nuts. So you know there is zero synergy between the departments. Asked me to write an email to feedback. What a hardworking staff. Want me to fix your company’s problem?

Difficult to find a human staff on the shop floor to consult and the paper diagramatic instructions lacks clarify and have no explanations.

Suggestion:  set up a table with power points at the product shelves (instead of at exit after payment counters) for buyers to power on lights and do pairing on the spot.  Provide instruction videos which could be accessed via a QR code on display at product shelves or in accompanying product instruction booklets.

Bought the third item knit track pant to entitle the 30% discount (for 3 items). The track pant is cooling and very comfortable. First time buying ANTA products, strongly recommended.

Mister Mobile (Jurong),3,"I’ve had a series of really frustrating experiences with this shop. On my first visit some months ago, I had an appointment to replace my phone’s LCD. They confirmed the appointment, but when I arrived, they told me there was no stock. This was never communicated in advance, so it was a wasted trip.

They did offer a small discount and eventually replaced the screen when I returned, but even then I had to wait in line despite having a scheduled time. They also didn’t have the same type of screen protector I had requested and gave me a lower quality one instead.

Most recently, I tried them again for my mother’s Samsung Note10 power button repair. They confirmed that a different branch had the part, but after waiting a couple of hours there, they told me their part wouldn't actually work and I’d have to come back again.

In short, each visit has been marked by poor communication and a lot of wasted time. Unfortunately, I can’t recommend this shop based on these experiences and I hope they improve their service in the future.

============
Edit
Staff reached out promptly after this review and assisted to settle the button issue within the next few days.
Hope that they continue to work on their services.",2025-08-22T08:22:55.095Z,retail,True,Promotional content detected,215,1220

Von's 1000 Spirits,5,"""My Boo"" - Ghost Town DJ's. (spirits, get it?)


Ever been blown away by almost everything you ate or had to drink? This place was so good we were all unanimously raving about it. We already miss Von's. 

We loved Von's so much that we ate at the Woodinville location a week later, after we got off our Alaska cruise in Seattle. 

This location was very close to Pike Market Place and to our hotel, the Alexis Royal Sonesta, all walking distance. Visited during Happy Hour, got a table after waiting about 20 minutes. 

FOOD:
- My favorite was the  Cachio E Pepe pizza with wood-fired sourdough pizza, 5 cheeses and drizzled with hot honey. Out of this world! 
- Smash Burger was a hit with my son. 
- Fries are fresh-cut and fried 'today', none of that frozen business. 
- husband ordered appetizers and a burger as well, all supremely delicious. 

DRINKS:
- came for Happy hour and stayed well past it. My favorite was the Hot Honey Paloma, ordered two of them.
- Skinny Bitch was amazing as well! The sparkly, color-changing light cube caught the attention of another couple on another table, so they ended up ordering it was well. 
- smoothest vodka I've ever had, puts Tito's to shame! It was so good I had to drive to Woodinville after we got back from our cruise to buy their Savor Spear Vodka from Northwest Spirits (Von's uses their spirits). Ended up lugging home four bottles of the stuff. 

SERVICE: 
- a big shout out to Ocean. He was amazing and made our dining experience superb! 
- everyone was also nice, not a mean spirit in the place! 

TOTAL: we feasted and had so many drinks we ran up our tab to about $182 but we didn't have to drive, so we were having a great time. 

RETURN FACTOR: may have to make a special trip out to Seattle just to go on an eating spree - Von's will be the primary reason we come back!",30/5/2025,Food & Beverage,True,Excessive punctuation,339,1832
Von's 1000 Spirits,5,"Yelp never fails to deliver! We wanted something different, so I started looking and found this restaurant. We got there on a Saturday at 5:15 pm and already had a 20 minute wait. It was definitely worth the wait! 

Our waitress Kayta I think that is how you spell it, was amazing. She offered her opinion on some of the dishes and the drinks which helped us decide. 

We happen to get there at happy hour. There is rarely a happy hour in Texas on a Saturday. 

There were 4 of us in our group and we decided to share. We ordered the Mac and cheese, pork carnitas loaded fries, and a pork carnitas and avocado pizza. The Mac and cheese was made with sourdough pasta. Holy cow!!!! It was soooo good. The fries were amazing as well. The pork had a very good flavor. The pizza was made on sourdough crust that was hand pulled as we sat there and put into a wood oven. It was so very good. We also got the salted caramel apple strudel. We were all so full and very satisfied. Everyone in our group was very happy with my choice of restaurants. 

While it was packed inside it wasn't too loud and it was a fun atmosphere.",11/5/2025,Food & Beverage,True,Excessive punctuation,214,1116
Von's 1000 Spirits,5,"Amazing restaurant! I thought this is just one of those corporate dinner spots in downtown Seattle and did not expect much however, they really exceeded my expectation and deliver such a great dinner!!

The appetizers were great to start with. The chicken was very tender, but flavorful for on trees I was completely mind blown by might help make pasta with salmon. The salmon was extremely tender and not fishy. The flavor went well, and the texture complimented the pasta. This dish is something that the chefs should definitely be proud of!!!!!

Amazing spot and I will definitely come back",27/3/2025,Food & Beverage,True,Excessive punctuation,100,593
Colony,4,"Colony is THE place for good quality lunch buffet in Singapore. Yesterday was not my first visit but after all these years, pre pandemic and we are still in a pandemic, the price remained somewhat the same. Personally I find the $64 per pax for a lunch  buffet reasonable. So after many visits to Colony, what did I notice?

FOOD 4/5
The Chinese section (dim sum) of the buffet remained the same. As in, they were not good. They never improved since my first review here. If those dim sum was the same served at their Chinese restaurant Summer Pavilion, rest assured I would never go there for dim sum. 

So let's name a few items I had: 
Fried Fish (The Wok section) - the batter was chewy, the fish was somewhat fishy. That's a no for me.

Prawns with veggies (can't remember the name, also The Wok section) - 5/5 love it! The prawns were huge and very fresh. 

Chicken Radish Soup 5/5 So good!! Tasted like what my mom made in the past.

Seafood Ramen 4/5 not bad but where were the seafood? 

Lucky for the patrons at Colony, i do not eat cold seafood, cooked or uncooked. They were standing in line and looking so pleased. I walked past the seafood section, two thumbs up cos they looked very fresh. Good for those who enjoyed them! 

Chicken Rice -4/5 Good, they nailed the rice of course and poached chicken was soft and tender. 

Bread & Butter 5/5 - Onion roll was amazing! The butter was as good as MEGGLE, my personal fav. 

Dessert (Lychee Rose, Mango Pudding, Tiramisu, Pandan Gula Melaka cake and Green Tea tart)
- 5/5 I enjoyed every bit of it.

Mango juice was so so good!!! 5/5

What to improve?? Pre pandemic their Western section was so good. In fact, that section was my favorite of all. They did away and set up a Grill & Rotisserie section. I found the items unexciting. Sorry!

AMBIANCE 5/5
Always love the ambiance at the Colony!! Lots of natural lighting.

SERVICE 5/5 *****
Solid 5 stars!! I never had a bad service at Ritz Carlton. Yesterday was another wonderful service provided by their staffs. Jane, Carmela and Kelly were very nice but the MVP went to Iraj. Iraj was very attentive, polite and friendly from the start to finish. He constantly cleared our used plates, checking in on us throughout the lunch, refilling our water. Iraj is the epitome of top notch service at a 5 star hotel.

I took my bestie out for lunch since I have not officially took her out to celebrate her acceptance  to Stanford. Iraj brought out a beautiful fruit platter with candle and a piece of chocolate saying ""Congratulations!"" 

Many thanks Iraj! Look forward to seeing you the next time I visit Colony!!",2/7/2022,Food & Beverage,True,Excessive punctuation,473,2619

Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,"Confronted by the capturing city skyline, I grew vulnerable at an instant. The breathtaking environ is uncontested, it is no wonder that others called it a romantic spot - I wouldn't refuse such claim. I often get bewitched by the apparent horizon at BLU, I have thought that was the most friendly distance with the clouds until the restaurant was shut last June. While seeing people displaying their portraits taken against the limitless blue plane on various social media platforms, I have secretly bookmarked the place even when there's nothing much to brag about on the food.

Located on the 56th floor at the iconic Ion shopping mall, one has to make his way to level 4 where he will be greeted by a Salt representative at the concierge counter before being transported to the restaurant in a private lift. Clad in stylish layout, pressed table cloth draping the well-aligned tables that sits under the tall ceiling, the space looks so accommodating. The sky bar adjoins Ion's observatory deck will open at dinner time, sets the mood for some romantic engagement. Even if you don't get to sit at the bar during the day, you could walk to the observatory deck for a 360degree view of the city landscape before getting yourself chained to the seat. The service staff are polite and sensitive to your needs. Undeniably knowledgeable on the food composite when I throw questions at her except a fair-skinned white macho who expressed disapproving frown when was told that the asparagus tasted weak under the strong blower in the restaurant.

I was nonetheless impressed with the Fig Tart but less with the crab omelette that many raved about. The brutal kind of tart that you must have, absolutely regrettable if you missed. Get ready to be charmed by that utmost thin and flaky puff pastry - resembles someone with bloated tummy, it was filled with airy compartments packed with overlapping pastry layers that was buttery and so brittle. The sweetness in the fig plus the caramelised onion adds sharp flavour to the puff, together with a smack drizzle of acidic verjuice. I liked the fact that they have been less generous with the blue cheese stuck between the figs and softened onions which may otherwise oust the celestial fit in the dish.

Most people will look for a robust egg dish that is almost always moist, tender yet with a sturdy structure. The Sydney crab omelette met the minimum - not overly cooked (though it could be better if it had been custardy) to hold up the hearty crab filling but taste flat. The spotless golden-yellow structure centred with simple embellishments was seen mediating in the miso broth with a zen outlook.

I chose the asparagus with confit eschallot. I couldn't stressed this much that it looked as if it was a cold dish to me. Others might find the dish positive but it seems less conclusive for me. The crunchy stems were cold and although the shallot confit adds slight flavour, I leave the dish unconsidered.

For the mains, the char grilled corn fed baby chicken fared sumptuously. Endless enjoyment to bits!! Instead of rubbery skin, it turn out thin crisps, splotched by a wider char surface. I love its smokey flavour that scent the fork-tendered juicy meat. While I enjoyed the well-seasoned juvenile drumsticks, I am more fond of the moisture trapped within the succulent meat space! And if you have not eaten a cauliflower puree, this is the time. The whitish pool of creamy cooked texture was laced with some lemon notes which brings out its dedicate flavour. With less added dairy, the puree retained its light fresher taste.

Guaranteeing the best beef from the Northwest of Tasmania, Australia; the Cape Grim has a pronounced wild taste in the meat. Claiming the Australia's finest hormone and GMO-free grass fed beef, it has been well sought after by top chefs world-widely. Going for medium rare preparation, the brownish exterior charred by flat iron encasing the pinkish marbled meat was somewhat appealing. The crust hasn't had the satisfactory bite but the meat texture was tender with a bit of chew. Smudge each piece in the tangy yet pungent verde sauce with tons of flavours coming from chopped parsley, basil, capers and garlic, for very acute taste. 

The greatest letdown was the Chocolate Soufflé which arrived with sheer dampness that I can't live in contention. Yes, it was baked airy in a milder chocolate note but it was all WATERY in the centre, and right to the base!! It seems like alien to me and so I have to summon my genuine feedback when someone came forward to clear my table. 

Chocolate Three Ways; the chocolate fondant cake has graced the dessert moment with lingering deep bitter flavour emitting from the moist cocoa sponge. The sweet-toothed wouldn't fancy this but they may find the milk Mars bar a bit more attractive. These desserts didn't quite complete my meal, less memorable. So, if I were to encode anything from Salt, it has to be the splendid horizon plus the entrée.",11/1/2013,Food & Beverage,True,Promotional content detected,851,4968

Salt Grill & Sky Bar,5,"This is a review of a Friday evening dinner date at Salt grill and Sky bar.

I have to admit the view is pretty spectacular.  Well, if you like urban skylines (I do), it is.

I was late.  My date was even later.  The staff made no mention of this.

The room is a very well appointed.  It is an impressive space with both modern and classic touches.  There is a large glass roof.  It truly hearkens to my expectations of traditional white-tablecloth fine-dining.  

I was surprised that the restaurant was only halfway full.  It is a very quiet and restrained restaurant.  The staff even sings ""Happy Birthday"" in a barely audible tone.

This continues to spill over into the service.  This is professional and polite.  It is reserved.  It is attentive.  There isn't any unnecessary chit-chat. 

The service was impeccable.  It was timely.  The staff was there when they should be.  The server was knowledgeable.  This is the very essence of fine dining service.  The meal was also well-paced.

This was the first restaurant I've visited in Singapore that offered a complimentary glass of champagne to start the meal.  

The food ranged from good to extremely good.  The presentation of each dish was another classic touch.  They were beautifully plated without giving into to being overly showy.

Complimentary Bread - A very nice fresh bread was provided.  It was served with olive oil and a mixture of high quality salt to dip it in.  When she quickly answered no to ""would you like more bread"", my dinner companion saved me from my own appetite.

http://tinyurl.com/c2wjy4n

Scallop raviolo in squid ink pasta, spiced tomato consomme, corn puree - I only had one bite of this.  It ended up squarely in front of my date.  It was very rich.  If they provided this as a main dish, I could easily order it.  For me, all of the ingredients worked well together.  I do not have a photo of this dish.

Roasted cherry tomatoes, Burrata cheese, peppers, grilled bread - This was extremely good.  It came close to allowing the red peppers to dominate.  But the creaminess of the Burrata and the sweetness of the roasted tomatoes helped to keep them in check.  The bread was grilled perfectly to hold the dish together.

http://tinyurl.com/akv3ufg

Duck sliders, pickled spring onion, cucumber - These were very good.  If I had my choice, I would probably have selected a high quality Western style bun over the more Asian style presentation.  Excluding the ""bun"", the ingredients provided an almost bahn mi experience.  

http://tinyurl.com/catdjll

Lamb cutlets Maori Lakes New Zealand, Provencal herbs - My friend ordered the lamb.  She was kind  enough to share a bite.  It was very good.  The balance of the flavour of the lamb was perfect for my own personal taste.  She seemed to enjoy it also.

http://tinyurl.com/azdxbho

Corn fed Spatchcock, Cajun and herb spices - I am not quite sure what made this dish a spatchcock, a cooking term for removing the main two bones and cooking the chicken flat.  I am also not sure what made it cajun.  It was certainly too mild to be considered Cajun.  However, it was extremely good.  The chicken was moist and tender.  While not particularly Cajun, the spices came together very well.  In finer restaurants, I seldom order chicken.  I am glad I tried theirs.  It was some of the best chicken I've had in quite awhile.

http://tinyurl.com/aou4p6q

We had sides of truffled mashed potato and roasted mushrooms.  Each of these were prepared in a very traditional manner.  They both served as comfortable compliments to our main dishes.

Pear Torte - This was her selected dessert.  I tried it.  I would have preferred the pear to be a little softer.  Plus, the pear tasted more like an an apple to me.  But, it was a nice dessert.

http://tinyurl.com/b2hamn8

Crème brûlée with salted caramel ice cream - This was not a traditional crème brûlée.  There was no hard carmelized layer to crack through.  For me, this dessert was more about the combination of ingredients with the ice cream as the anchor of the dish.  I thought it was a great way to end the meal.

Overall, Salt grill + Sky bar offers exactly what I expect from a true fine-dining experience.  The room is beautiful.  The staff is professional and on-point.  The meal flows at a proper pace.  The food is consistently very good.  It also affords that added touch of a truly beautiful urban view.  

Throughout writing this review, I mentally debated four stars or five stars. A part of me thought the food fell just slightly short.  Another part thought the enjoyment of the experience was slightly diminished by the fact the room was not nearly full.  

In the end though, I do think this was a five star experience.",9/12/2012,Food & Beverage,True,Contains links/URLs,810,4793

Inside the Cloud Forest, you will also witness the largest indoor waterfall on the planet.

Cloud Forest,5,"The Cloud Forest is truly a sight to behold. It's everything you see on all those travel shows and more. It definitely lives up to its expectations and is not one of the ""tourist traps"". 

We came by on a Thursday at around 4 pm . We had a combined Gardens by the Bay ticket, which included entrance to the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. We purchased it through Klook, and they have various combo options. I'd definitely recommend purchasing tickets beforehand because the tickets to purchase on site looked like it would take an extra 20 minutes or so. By pre-purchasing, it was a breeze. There was no wait and they just scanned our ticket barcode.

Inside, you'll want to take a pic with the iconic waterfall at the entrance. Luckily, it wasn't too crowded at the time we went, so we didn't have to wait too long. There are different levels of flowers and plants you can take the elevator too. At the time of year we went (September 2022), they were prepping for an Avatar exhibit so it seems like there might be something special going on at certain times if you're lucky enough to catch it. There are a lot of high winding walkways, so just beware if you're afraid of heights. For us, it took about 30 to 45 minutes to walk through and explore everything from entry to exit.

Cloud Forest,5,"It's really a remarkable feat to have this completely different environment contained inside this bubble. Cloud Forest features a giant waterfall surrounded by hundreds of plants. I purchased our group tickets online as a package deal with the Flower Dome and Floral Fantasy. At the time of visit, they were doing a promotional exhibit with the new Avatar movie.

As you enter, you're immediately greeted by the much cooler temperature and the spray of mist from the waterfall. Because of the Avatar experience, there are a couple of interactive exhibits. The path is designed so everyone only goes in one direction but it'll take you to the top, around the walkways above the waterfall, and then back down. There's elevators and escalators so it's pretty accessible!

Overall, it probably took the group closer to an hour to finish the whole thing. There's a lot of photo spots and it was nice just hanging out inside to escape the muggy heat. This is for sure a tourist spot but worth it!",23/2/2023,Arts,True,Promotional content detected,170,990

The entire attraction is amazing right when you walk in. I honestly had a hard time telling the difference between the real plants and fake decorations because the real plant life looks so amazing. I can definitely see why the movie Avatar was based off this attraction. 

I loved that it was air conditioned and cool in there. It was amazing getting out of the hot Singapore humidity. Initially I was afraid the Avatar part would be gimmicky and make it boring but I actually enjoyed it. I was able to purchase my ticket using the Gocity pass which allowed me to bypass the lines and also see multiple exhibits for a discount. I highly recommend doing that.

Cloud Forest,5,"Loved this exhibit probably the most out of the whole Gardens by the Bay. You walk in, and are welcomed by this HUGE indoor waterfall. What an entrance!!!!

You end up walking up a bit, through this indoor botanical garden, but it's quite different from Flower Dome. Here instead, it's greenery all over the walls, covering pretty much every square inch. It's quite impressive. After walking up a path, you have the option to take the elevator, or keep walking. I would highly recommend taking the elevator all the way up to the top floor, then working your way down, either walking or by escalator. You can take your time browsing the various greenery, displayed so nicely, like you are in a forest. 

I also loved the carnivorous plant exhibit towards the top! Really fun reading and seeing the plants that eat flies - so gross but interesting. 

Surprisingly too, the temperature in here was quite cool too, with it being probably around 60 degrees F. If you hate plants overall, the Cloud Forest's cool climate may be enticing enough for your visit as respite from the hot humid Singapore heat.

The dome is majestic with beautiful greenery contained within. At the end there is also great info on how they power gardens by the bay with sustainable energy, and a video on climate change encouraging you to be more environmentally friendly. 

I went around sunset which is best- you get to see it in the day as you enter and as you slowly descend the dome, the sun sets and at the end it was nightfall and I got to see the dome at night too!!

Cloud Forest,5,"Wow. 

That is the first word that comes to mind as you enter the Cloud Forest at the Gardens by the Bay. Your breath is taken away as you look up at the world's tallest indoor waterfall and think to yourself ""where the hell am I?""

Am I in Pandora? Did I become an Avatar? No?

I'm still human? And in a cooled greenhouse on the Singapore waterfront? None of this should make sense, but it does and it is an experience not to be missed. 

The Cloud Forest is a really unique experience featuring the upper level vegetation and climates without climbing up 4-5,000 feet. The elevator ride up to the top and the gentle walk down the pathways to the ground level feature a pretty mesmerizing experience of flora and fauna all surrounding this gentle mist of the waterfall. It isn't really much of a hike, but I suppose you could say you did it if you need the exercise points.

You pay cover of $38 and receive a drink coupon. Attire is dressy, men can't wear shorts. Once you pay, you go up in the elevator and there's an entry way where you can hear the music coming from. Dimly lit with loud music is the standard for any bar/lounge, and it isn't anything different here... except the music really was not enjoyable. Weird techno/house music that didn't really have a great beat, blasting loudly that you can barely hear your friends. Maybe the drinks would help things out?

Unfortunately they didn't - not sure if it's because they took our coupons and decided to skimp out for the freebie, but all our drinks tasted like they had no alcohol in it. The bartenders were not the least bit friendly either.

Fantastic views of Singapore. This is an equally fantastic view you can enjoy from the MBS Infinity pool though. If you're a hotel guest, skip the bar by all means, and just enjoy the pool. This is the location of the Crazy Rich Asians ending scene too, which is kind of cool. 

Lousy drinks - they are the same price what you'd pay at a good cocktail bar (there are SO many world's top 50 cocktail bars in Singapore!!!), except they taste like shampoo. Super gross. They were somewhat drinkable though, and I did drink them to prevent waste. They also couldn't make the ""Sunset Sling"" drink I wanted for some reason. 

Service was irritating - unattentive, even though the place was empty.

The music was also not really the vibe for a bar/lounge type setting. We tried to stick it out to make it worth our money but eventually decided we were wasting our time, so we ended up leaving.

The view of the Singapore skyline is a must see when in Singapore and CE LA VI, located on top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, truly delivers. We snagged an awesome table (comfortable seats, red pillows, the whole shabang) right at the edge of the club and the infinity pool with the skyline right behind us. BREATHTAKING. I spent a good half hour taking pictures of the view. 

Music? Well it was ladies night when I had the pleasure of visiting CE LA VI so the DJ played a bunch of the typical ""ladies, turn up!!!!!"" songs, but all in all, he definitely knew what the crowd wanted. Props, Mr. DJ.

Now for the alcohol. To be honest, I have no idea how much bottles are here because my friend foot the tab but I do know that the shots here range above S$30+ (about $22 USD). Bit pricy for US standards but I've heard that it's to be expected in Singapore.

However, each cocktail will cost about S$25 (just less than $20 USD) after the Service Charge (10%) and GST (7%). But, as the others said... you are paying for the view. It will take a while for you to get your drink though, it took about 15 minutes to get the bartender's attention and about 15 minutes more just to get our change/credit cards back. But, these are pretty high quality drinks that you can not get at a hectic club. A lot of the options were fruity and sweet, my favorite! We had a few drinks here, it took a while but it was worth the view.

Pros of the JW Marriott:
-Great location, close distance walking to several areas including Colonial district, Little India, and touristy things like Raffles hotel, and pretty close to Chinatown. 
-Nice room - great lighting, modern furniture
-Excellent service, from the housekeeping that cleaned our rooms, to the Executive Lounge staff, who greeted and chatted with us like we were old friends!!
-Excellent breakfast at the Beach Road next door, included for Titanium Elites. This was better than most hotel breakfasts I had ever been to!! It included several different Asian dishes such as chicken egg noodle soup, laksa, dim sum (in your own little steamer!), Nasi Lemak, and your typical American favorites like scrambled eggs, truffled eggs, pastries, and fresh fruit. The food was all tasty too! 
-Infinity Pool was quite amazing. It has this killer view, located on the corner of the 18th (?) floor, with the city skyline and Marina Bay Sands in the background. 
-Excellent supply of bottled water, maid service was generous to refill with several bottles each day.

Cons:
-Pool water was very, very ice cold, which felt horrible, even in the hot Singapore heat. Wish it was heated!!! Also, there wasn't much room around the pool for lounge chairs. All they had was some uncomfortable benches, which was quite a bummer.

Service?? Staff?? The staff is beyond helpful, warm, greeting. They go out of their way to say hi, ask if everything is well, bring things as you need them....overly accommodating in every way.  Reuben at the front desk was especially helpful the night we checked in.  Everyone seemed to remember us and our names as we came & went thru the lobby.

Food?  There are quite a few dining options in the South Beach square that are affiliated with the hotel.  The restaurants in the NCO club are wonderful.  The Beach Kitchen was good as well.  Harrys and Alchemist are great for drinks and quick bites.  Having a Starbucks there is a lifesaver for us Americans that crave our Sbucks!

I love the super trees, and the indoor botanical garden was my favorite - it's a nice break from the heat too, because it's always so humid in Singapore... but inside the Flower Dome, it's actually air conditioned and not hot like a greenhouse. The flowers are just stunning and the whole expanse is very walkable! I really enjoyed the giant indoor waterfall across the way in the Cloud Forest dome as well. Of note - to go into the flower dome, or any of the other ""dome"" experiences, you have to buy separate tickets (or a ticket package). It's kind of expensive, if memory serves it was like $60 USD for two of the 4-5 experiences they had available. Was worth it in my opinion, but doing every experience would be both expensive, and exhausting since the heat/humidity while walking around really saps your energy!

One other note: at the ticket area near the flower dome/Cloud Forest, there's a little cafe with snacks and ice cream. I am a total sucker for floral flavors, so the floral ice creams were right up my alley! I got a double scoop (2 flavors) of ice cream, the orchid vanilla and the cherry blossom. They're sweet and floral - I just love it. Great given the heat too! They do NOT let you sample any of the ice creams though so beware of that.

Wow!! What an incredible, iconic place to visit in Singapore. We had limited time as our flights were delayed, but we were lucky to arrive at the Golden Hour. So beautiful to walk through the gardens as the sun was setting. 

Floral Fantasy. The Cloud Forest. Supertree Grove. Dragonfly and Kingfisher Lakes. Serene Garden. The Canyon. 

So many stunning gardens. 

Since we had very limited time, we mainly explored the Cloud Forest and the Supertree Grove.       

The Cloud Forest at Gardens by the Bay created an immersive experience inspired by the movie Avatar. So interesting to see the mystical world of Pandora brought to life across the iconic cascading waterfalls, beautiful gardens and elevated walkways in the Cloud Forest.

Separated into five zones, a life-size banshee welcomes visitors to the World of Pandora. Loved the beautiful pathways lit up at night in a splash of colors.

As you explore each zone, there are docents that operate a puppet baby banshee and baby viperwolf as well as other audio and visual representations of the film. Cute to snap a selfie.

Other highlights included the cavern with stalagmites and stalactites, the collection of white Dale Chihuly glass and the Orchid Haven. The ""Cloud Mountain"" itself is amazing. It is covered in orchids, ferns, mosses and bromeliads. I bet without the Avatar Experience, it still would have been amazing.

Afterwards, we headed to the Supertree Grove for the sound and light show. AMAZING!! Loved the free Garden Rhapsody light-and-sound show where the trees ""come alive"" dancing to the music nightly.

It is also so interesting how these artificial trees mimic natural plants. The Supergrove Trees harness solar energy by using photovoltaic cells. They also collect rainwater for use in irrigation and fountain displays

The orange and pink hues from the sunset were just sprinkles on top to be honest! Additionally, the vertical gardens are marvelous! It was super cool seeing flowers bloom so high up!

I was confused because I thought it would have been the two main attractions in one package, super tree grove + cloud forest. Little did I know after the purchase, that the tickets were for super tree grove observatory and flower dome (the dumb one still don't know what it's officially called). I then went on to purchase the cloud forest ticket, which was only available in a package with the flower forest (the dumb flower one) and not available as a single purchase. I called +65 6420 6848 multiple times. The automated message prompted me ""to speak to the service representative 1"" after pressing ""1"" I was relayed to the same repeat message to press ""1"". This process occurred about 5 times in a row. The final time, the automated message said ""you have not selected a choice or pressed a button, please call back at another time"" and hung up. 
There I was stuck with two flower dome tickets. When I got to the gardens at the bay I reluctantly walked through the flower attraction bs. Dumbest thing ever but I paid for it, reluctantly, twice. Went onto the cloud forest, meh. Then came the super tree grove. During that day it started raining, so we waited until the rain halted. Then we were told that to get into the super tree grove we would ""need to purchase another ""Christmas event special ticket"". I was flabbergasted, as to why the website wouldn't just sell the Christmas event ticket with the super tree ticket. Then I stood in line to purchase the ""Christmas event ticket"" so that I could honor my super tree grove ticket. After waiting ten minutes in line I got to the front  to purchase this ""Christmas event ticket"" the ticket counter workers told me ""the super tree grove has been suspended due to inclement weather and we do not recommend purchasing Christmas event tickets"". I asked ""so will I be refunded for my original ticket super tree grove ticket?"" The worker said ""to email: feedback@gardensbythebay.com.sg and request for a refund due to inclement weather"". I left the line when it just stopped raining. I went back through the line to the ticket counter and the workers said the same thing ""that it was suspended until further notice and that they don't recommend purchasing tickets"". I said ""alright how or when will you know if it will open?"" The workers said ""oh when they give us a call"". I said ""how will I know if it is open?"" And they gave me a . So I decided to take a walk around the lake where those animal sculptures. Unbeknownst, I fell upon the entrance to the Christmas event. I noticed out of the corner of my eye that workers were letting customers walk inside scanning what looked like CHRISTMAS EVENT TICKETS. I showed  the person at the front my super tree observatory ticket and asked if I could get in and he said ""you need to purchase the Christmas special ticket"". I told him that the ticket counter said that "" the super tree was suspended because of the rain"". He mentioned that it was ""not closed and I could purchase the Christmas event online"" and gave me the QR code for the website. I then went to the website and purchased two Christmas entry tickets for $18. Hooray we finally succeeded, right?  We can finally watch that show at 7:45pm from the observatory. We decided to go to check in at the bottom of the super tree observatory. I was excited to watch the show on that walkway when all of a sudden, the workers at the super tree at the bottom said that ""the walkway is a separate ticket and that you have to exit the Christmas tree area to access it"". I said ""OK BRO IM SO CONFUSED RIGHT NOW I didn't see anything about two separate tickets for the super tree grove"" I then said ""ok whatever"" and decided to enter the observatory anyway because ""we thought"" it would still be cool. Went to the top of the observatory to watch the show. Little did we know that we would be on the top of the lights so WE COULDN'T EVEN SEE THE LIGHT SHOW ON THE TREES because the observatory is above the lights. Absolute waste of time. I decided to look on the website  to see where the ""walkway"" tickets were located. It was of course not on the main page but a ""see all"" tab listed it as an OBCB Walkway (or something like that) it did not mention that it was apart of the super tree grove whatsoever.

Gardens By The Bay,5,"A must visit place in Singapore!!!!

With about 10 hours layover in Singapore, we decided to leave the airport and made Gardens by the Bay our very first stop. Don't waste your time and try to save a little bit of money by taking the train. Download ""Grab"" app, it's the equivalent of Uber here in Singapore. From the airport to the garden, it was around $15 for us, and only took about 20mins, train would be over an hour.

It is free admission to Gardens by the Bay. However, the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest, which located inside Gardens by the Bay (hence, the plural in ""Gardens""), do require admission fees. I highly recommend checking out those 2 as well, especially if it's your first time in Singapore. They're well worth it.

There are bicycles for rent (requires an app) if you want to bike around the park, or just venture on foot. We saw plenty of runners and bikers around the perimeter of the Garden since it was still early in the morning (before 10am)

If you've watched ""Crazy Rich Asians"" movie, the last scene where the wedding happened was here at Gardens by the Bay. And it's free! You can also pay to go up to those huge Supertree Groves, which connected by a view deck. 

We spent a good 3-4 hours here (with more than half of those in the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest) and still didn't get the chance to see everything.

Luckily, we showed up in the afternoon, so it was a bit slower, and they were able to get us seats at the bar after about a 45min wait. Dress code only applies after 5pm as well, which we were happy about since we had been walking around Singapore in more casual attire the whole day.

As the bar with the most number of gins in the world, it's clear what kind of spirit you're going to be drinking mostly. Though, they do have others as well - I actually got their old fashioned, though with a look of disappointment from the bartender. Old fashioned was fantastic. My wife got the gin and tonica, which was incredible! The bartenders were very knowledgeable- making custom drinks based on flavor profiles I requested. For example, they used a lemongrass-infused gin for one of my cocktails, which was great!

Just google the pictures - it's quite an amazing setting. It's a HUGE bar, with furniture and 1920s setting in what feels like the prohibition Great Gatsby era, Art Deco.  It's done incredibly well. 

But back to the drinks....they are famous for their Gin and Martinis. They have a very wide selection of different types of gins, including rare ones that date back to the 1920s!!! and every decade from 1920s until now!!! Quite impressive, especially if you are into Gin.
 
My husband and I got a few rounds here before dinner elsewhere. I ended up getting the Atlas Orange Gin and Tonic, which was fantastic. It's their own made orange gin, and it tastes like oranges. It was delicious, and I wish I had tried a little bit more of the gin itself before mixing all the tonic inside. 

My husband got the Atlas Suite of Martinis, which included 3 mini martinis each of the Atlas martini, orange blossom martini, and the espresso martini. Those were pretty good too, our favorite being the espresso martini. 

2nd round - I got the Atlas French 75 (London dry gin, lemon, peach, salt, champagne), with a candied kumquat on top. Delicious... My husband ordered the Barrel-Rested Gin and Tonic (Australian barrel-rested gin, yuzu tonic, ginger) - loved this one. You could really taste the yuzu flavor, and it went very well with the gin. So delicious!!!

I also saw on their website that they have this bottomless pouring menu on Sundays....wow. Over the top. Wish I could experience that sometime in my lifetime.

From curious-looking statues and gargoyles to truly intricate gilded gold Art Deco architecture, the ambience in this place is STUNNING. You will absolutely need to make reservations for afternoon tea in advance because they tend to be booked out a month in advance. There is a dress code (for example, men need to wear long pants and covered shoes) so be mindful of that. Service was great - the hostess immediately noticed I was pregnant and ensured that all items in my tea platter were fully cooked and offered a non-alcoholic drink menu (highly recommend the Crown Utama one with grape verjus by the way - so refreshing!). I did however wish that she would have informed me that they'd be replacing my smoked salmon and iberico jambon bites with just avocado and red peppers so that I could have chosen to keep those and give them to my dining companion instead (since iberico ham is way more expensive than red peppers!). The $56++/pax afternoon tea menu includes 2 drinks (namely a small welcome cocktail/mocktail and a pot of tea)- everything else will cost you extra. The food itself was good, with the best item probably being the mushroom with mashed potato purée and banana cream pie tart. The music playlist at the venue was stellar.

There are quite a few interesting drinks and spirits on the menu -- and you will pay for them! The food menu is a bit limited, but everything that we had was quite good. They serve their gin drinks in large goblets with lots of ice, and they match the tonic with the botanicals in the gin you select, which I think is the proper way to do it.

I loved flipping through the menu before settling on the most basic of basic: The ATLAS Gin & Tonic.. :) Definitely the best G&T I've had in my life, but then again I've only had a handful worthy of mentioning in the first place. However, ATLAS was hands down the most stunning interior I've ever seen. My husband and I just sat on the couch with our heads swiveling back and forth taking in the decor. In the center of the bar is a giant elevator-like shaft with level upon level of bottles.. and a little dolly for the employees to harness themselves in and wheel up and down.

The impression you get when you walk in is breathtaking where you feel you walk into a totally different era.

Drinks are wonderful - I had one that had some cardamom and gin and it was fantastic. They have a huge Gin tower with the largest selection of Gin I've ever seen and some interesting vintage Gin that didn't taste much different to me (I tried the 80s gin). Great bartenders and friendly hostesses. I've been here 3 times and found service to be fine at peak and normal hours so maybe they got it down.

Definitely a hot spot that I would highly recommend (and make reservations for). Only downside is that since that area is still full of surrounding construction, it isn't too easy to call a cab or pin point the Uber location since the 600 North Bridge Address is the entire building's address with a drop off point in front of the building (Atlas is in the back).

Bar Stories was a fabulous discovery, but it wasn't all smooth sailing. Came here early on a Friday around 6PM and was surprised that no one else was in the upstairs bar! We're Americans, but it's way past the ""it's 5 o'clock somewhere"" people!! Hint: usually people don't go drinking until after 7:30PM we noticed

I loved their ambiance and setup. Haji Lane is known for being a #hipster part of Bugis, and it's packed with kitschy/kooky boutiques and trinket stores as well as poppin' and packed chill bars and outdoor happy hours. I've visited twice, and both times were full of laughing customers, beer drinking, and dart throwing (damn those kids!). Thankfully, Bar Stories is up above on the second floor and away from the loud EDM sloppy messes downstairs.

We were the first customers that late afternoon/early evening, and loved the wooden steps, AC, and loungey chairs. There was no menu, and basically my advice to you yelpers is to be very specific about what kind of drink you like. Cool, you like citrus? Well what kind? Grapefruit, lemon, orange, or pink lemonade? You like sweet? Well do you like peach, strawberry, cherry, or grape? I was looking for a tequila/mezcal drink with a refreshing and smoky hint to it, not sweet at all and not too citrus-y. I mentioned that I love blackberry and anything with berry in it. My bartender made me a delicious tequila drink with lemon juice, and lots of additional crazy going on with kaffir leaves (think thai food) and a dried bamboo for aesthetic! It was milky like foam texture on the surface, but a smooth and refreshing sipper. LOVE. Shoutout to the bartender...even though it took literally 15-20 minutes, it was worth the wait.

My sister's drink wasn't as well received. I'm chuckling as I think back to it, but the bartender that day said that he was going to make it with peach and vodka, since she wanted a vodka drink that was sweet. He also mentioned another fruit that she liked and she though COOL, rad. I love all those things. Oh boy, the final combination was a cherry bomb of Kool-Aid flavor. Not the business. We felt bad asking him to remake it since each drink averaged around $19-$25, and that's an insane price! Even when I go out in San Francisco, I wouldn't dream of paying over $18 for a beautifully-crafted cocktail. But Singapore has different standards, as I came to understand throughout my stay.

Service is pretty much in the creation of your drink. They spend a solid 20 minutes on your drink, but there aren't cocktail servers walking around since the space itself is pretty tiny. In addition to the main space by the bar, there was also a back room that holds larger parties. But I can definitely see this place crowding up when it gets packed! It can be a great spot for a intimate conversation or even a small gathering for a GNO, but personally I wouldn't squeeze up in here with a large party...too much work to get everybody up in the birdhouse!",8/4/2016,Food & Beverage,True,Excessive punctuation,531,2987

It's not often that you go into a bar and end up having a sipping the drink of the patrons next to you - and you're not drunk! But wow, the peanut butter, ice-cream, bourbon concoction was so damn good, it had to be shared!! 

I'd heard good things about Bar Stories... no menu, interactive, you just tell the staff 'what you feel like'. Our descriptions ranged from ""tropical spicy"" to ""a manly drink"" and ""something with passionfruit"", and Zach and Tilo (name?) managed to hit the spot every time. 

Sitting at the bar was fun and entertaining... we made friends with our new neighbors and the staff. I don't think the experience is for everyone though... it's pretty intense and full on, so if you want just a quiet drink - I'd advise sitting at a table in a corner. But it was so refreshing to have this interaction and watching them make the drinks was almost as good as drinking them! 

Yes it is a little pricey but not outrageous...approx $25 per cocktail and they don't skimp on effort, ingredients or quality and we were definitely a little 'happy' on our way to our dinner reservations. Zach was an absolute star and the couple next to us wanted to take him home to Australia to be the cocktail specialist at his 60th! 

The only reason it doesn't get a 5 stars? Two of the staff were obviously in a relationship which don't get me wrong, is fine... but it seemed a little unprofessional to watch them canoodling behind the bar while working...

There's no dress code but because of the fancy-ish decor, I'd recommend having something a little nicer on. 

Their cocktail menu was presented in a magazine and it looked so legit! The first couple pages list all the drinks and our waitress explained that the drinks get stronger as you go down the chart. The rest of the magazine gives more details on each cocktail and there's even a section for punch bowls at the very end. You can even buy the magazine as a souvenir!

Sakura Martini: Being a martini, this drink was really strong. I mean, straight up alcohol. The gin is infused with Sakura and the drink comes with a little Sakura flower on the bottom. I kind of remember it being slightly sweet but the alcohol really overpowers everything. 

Ichigo Bowl: It's about 15-20 servings, depending how generous you are with your scoop. Definitely more than enough for a group of 6, especially since we each got our own drink on top of this. Our waitress was very attentive and kept refilling our cups through the night. I really enjoyed this drink and everyone was either too full or drunk by the end.

We had a great chat with some of the staff about various gins, small-batch producers, and the industry as a whole... these folks aren't just phoning it in - they love what they do. My favourite drink was the Sakura Sakura - just a right amount of sweetness, but they will also create something to your taste - just tell them what you like.

The snacks were also good.  The deconstructed cypress skewers were just ok, but the friend pickles were excellent. It was a huge bowl of tempura'd pickles veggies with a delicious creamy dipping sauce,  And the chicken meatballs with cheese sauce made us want to lick the plate.

Why am I fan of this place? 

1. It's gorgeous! I'm sure it's renovated, but the dark wood and fake original floor tile (I think) provides a relaxed setting. I was expecting it to be pretentious. It was not at all. I mean, it is in the SPECTACULARLY beautiful ICONIC Raffles Hotel. You expect it to be a bit more glam. But, it was perfection. 

2. The Singapore Sling (S$27) was really delicious. It was also expensive. But, I really enjoyed it. I will probably NEVER buy another one from this place though.

I love the Asian-style fans that that they hang from the ceiling. According to my cousin, this is probably the only place in Singapore where you're allowed to litter, so enjoy cracking those peanuts and knocking those shells on the floor!

Personally, I like the Singapore Sling- I find it fruity and refreshing. It doesn't taste too strong alcohol-wise, and I don't get much of a buzz after one. I can't remember the exact price, but it was between $25-30. Pricey, but hey, when in Singapore, right? I will admit that I've never tried the sling at another bar, so if there's a spot on that island that serves a better version, I'd be willing to give it a try!

If you're not going to try the Singapore Sling, I recommend just sticking with wine, beer, or hard liquor. I tried another cocktail a while back (it was the Philippine answer to the Singapore Sling) but it was nothing to Yelp about.

I wouldn't worry too much about dress code, as every one seems relaxed (after all, there's peanut shells in the crevices of the couches and chairs) but if you want to err on the side of caution, smart casual's the way to go.",3/5/2014,Food & Beverage,True,Promotional content detected,280,1525

Chye Seng Huat Hardware,3,"Good coffee. I mean really good coffee is actually harder to find in Singapore than you would think given the plethora of coffee shops opening here. Chye Seng Huat's blend is not only good on most days, it can be one of the best in Singapore. We have been tag teaming this establishment and Toby's Estate over in Robertson Quay for sometime and we think Chye Seng Huat may be starting to edge out the Quay's competition including Kith.

Having said that, the reason why they lost out those extra points to score well in my books:

1. Their food is just A-OK. I think the best dish I've had in there is their steak sandwich. Cakes lift their game a little.

2. Floor service is really good for a coffee shop so the fact that they have so many service staff on the floor puzzled me as to why the staff can't take orders. You must go queue at the cashier and order there. Make sense? Not to me. They have a strength but are not entirely using it effectively.

3. Cashier service, as it has become a customer front and interface is actually not that good despite the good floor service. As Chye Seng Huat has pushed the customer experience to us queuing at the cashier, I have to say that the cashier has on a number of occasions not controlled the queue properly by allowing selfish customers who stand right in front of the cashier waiting for their takeaway coffee and hindering attempts from customers behind wanting to place their order so they can sit down again!

4. Chye Seng Huat opens at 9am (its stated very clearly). Yet, on one morning, management apparently decided to hold a staff meeting at 9am that didn't finish until 9:30am. Not only that, they decided not to offer customers standing outside waiting to come in to sit down.

So while the place definitely serves good coffee, we feel that management needs to pick up some common sense and optimise and improve quality of customer service and its hot food menu.

Has POTENTIAL but is not recognising and/or addressing the gaps. I feel their overall rating is a little inflated because I have read reviews here where they point out similar flaws I've found and still rate it as 4 stars?!!! C'mon people.

National Gallery Singapore,4,"If you love art. This is the place to be. 

Upon arriving.. since my friend is a local. They had some sort of promotion going on for locals who had a particular bank card. If you have that bank card.. you and a friend get free passes to the museum plus free passes to the upgraded editions of the museum. To be honest I'm not sure if it was one or two friends free but the guy at the ticketing counter gave the three of us three free passes to go into the museum. (Originally he gave her her free pass. And me a free pass. But my husband was missing one pass. I think he said something to my friend and gave the regular admission to my husband after that. So not sure if its 2 or 3 free admissions with that bank card).

There's lots of art work here since it is a National Gallery Museum. But kind of a bit disappointed. It was more of a mixture of arts throughout parts of Asia, England..etc. Not too much Singaporean arts so kind of disappointed on that part. I truely believe you should come here early because its a huge museum. We spent 2 hours there but had dinner reservations so we didnt finish it all. The hallways are also a bit confusing as theres no arrows or a direct way to walk through it. So you can get a but lost inside as well.

National Gallery Singapore,5,"What a stunning museum and great use of repurposing two beautiful old buildings.  I was so glad I chose to stop into the National Gallery Singapore during my recent trip to Singapore.

If you are an art obsessed person like myself, you could easily spend an entire day here.  My time was limited and I enjoy modern and contemporary art more than anything else, so I chose to focus on three things: 1) The Level 4 Gallery and Wu Guanzhong Gallery, both showing modern artists for limited time installations 2) Level 5 and galleries 13,14 & 15, which all are contemporary artists and are part of the permanent installation and 3) the ""Building Highlights"" tour (offered in English and lasting about an hour).  

Now the National Gallery Singapore only opened November 2015 and I was under the impression that all I might see was more sedate Southeast Asian art.  In my brief visit, I was completely wrong and was blown away by the modern, edgy stuff on display.  Not only is the building a magnificent architectural wonder of old meets modern, what great edgy work by artists of Asia now!  

Now I will go back on a future visit to spend more time in the bulk of the Southeast Asian Art (which really is the bread and butter of the museum), but so happy to see the contemporary piece too.  

There are like eight food and drink options on sight and not to mention the very cool Gallery & Co gift shop.

just 10 years from pm lee's mention to fruition.

i must say they did a great job carving out this historic space, sprucing, preserving, conserving and finally, beautifying it to it's current magnificence.
every corner you look, there is something of interest to the lens.

now, where do i begin?
how about that i have never set foot into this compound until 2015?!
amazing isn't it?
sure, many a photo shoot took place outside but never inside.
sure, i used to play rugby on the lawn fronting the now national gallery. 
but being inside is a grand new experience for me.

you might get a little lost the first time you are in here.
so be sure to grab a map from any of the handy and helpful guides littered around the grounds.
for a more interactive approach, do download the gallery explorer app available only for iphone and ipad(for now).
or call a yelp friend in ally t and she will be more than happy to be your guide!?;)

i like how much space there is, relative to the crowd. 
you can take in the arts, in relative peace. 
maybe the tour groups have yet to descend upon the gallery in throngs?

as for now all singaporeans get in for free!
so bring your pink ic and students, bring your student pass!
register at the ticket counter and they will give you an entry sticker, then you are free to roam.
free, wifi enabled roaming.
take selfies, wefies, etcs and upload relentlessly!

i like how you can get up close to most of the art works and sniff the oil on the canvas.
just kidding, but there are no physical barriers, just black lines drawn on the ground to demarcate no fly zones.
no overzealous staff to spoil your enjoyment, as you wander around without restrain.
just don't damage any pieces by accidentally falling into them!

there are also places both indoors and outdoors where you can sit and relax before continuing with yet, more viewing pleasures.
so sit, relax and take in the view of MBS or the reflections pool or just people watching in general.

and as and when you are sick of all the audio, visual arts, kid's art, pop-up art that bombards you, just chill at one of the many new f&b outlets that are equally stunning.

It has a fantastic interior and even sensors for their escalators. I was bummed I wasn't going to Night Safari. We went for a walk near City Hall and I walked by this museum. I noticed the signs for Monet and Raden Saleh, and I told my father I really wanted to visit. They do have student discounts, so I got like $5 bucks off and paid $25 for all access admission to Century of Light exhibit and general admission. I really was impressed with this museum. There's tons of art to see. If you like Asian watercolors, there's some. If you like modern art by Asian artists, there's a lot of that. I am so happy I saw some obscure art. I am so used to seeing American artists in San Fran. So, the key exhibit was the Impressionist art. All pieces on loan from Musee d'Orsay in Paris. I was happily going through the exhibit until some mean bossy woman told me that my camera was making noise when taking pics. I saw her tell on me to a person working there. That was so rude. I mean get over the camera noise and get over yourself entitled American lady! Just walk away yourself. Besides that, I really liked seeing the Rouen Cathedral piece by Monet there. Really great. Who doesn't enjoy Impressionists like Monet, Renoir, Manet, Pissarro and Cézanne? Then I liked the Raden Saleh(from Java) and Juan Luna(from Philippines). Really great to see SE Asian art. 

The museum is a bit confusing. After getting your tickets, I would go to the Info desk and ask them to explain the layout and map. It's really helpful to ask before having at the collection. There's the Supreme Court Chamber and the City Hall Chamber. City Hall Chamber 3rd floor are where the key exhibits are. Supreme Court Chamber has some history and SE Asian art. There's a bridge on 3rd floor to different section. 5th floor has outside terrace with views. There's various nice restaurants in museum even a Chinese restaurant and the classy Violet Oon.

I was raised in Asia and I grew up watching doraemon so I was really excited when I found out that the national museum of Singapore was holding the doraemon exhibition when I was there! There were three parts to the exhibition--two of them were in the basement where they showcased the doraemon modern art pieces and the third one was on the ground floor where they showed the original drafts of the manga. 

Right outside of the exhibits in the basement, they had a very cute Doraemon themed cafe where they served dorayaki. I didn't really try it since I'm not a big fan of red bean but it smelled good and the price was pretty reasonable! The art pieces in the exhibition were really cool! It was very interesting to see artworks of doraemon with a modern twist and my favorite ones had to be the ones with Takashi Murakami's flower! They also sold some limited edition merchandise outside of the exhibits that were difficult to find anywhere else! My boyfriend and I couldn't help ourselves and bought a puzzle and a magnet that were made based on the Takashi Muramami's Doraemon art! 

Overall, my boyfriend and I had a great time here! The staffs were very helpful and nice and the directions was very clear. If you have a chance to come, don't forget to go to the second floor!

National Museum of Singapore,5,"I love this museum! It is an awesome way to learn about Singapore's history and a must visit! 

First of all, on the day I went there were very few people at the museum. I practically had it all to myself! I checked in and got my temperature taken really quickly. The tickets are a little expensive - $15 for adults, $10 concession - but once you go inside you won't regret it.

I first went to the Singapore History Gallery. There were a lot of cool artifacts, books, maps, letters etc. Lots of interesting stuff about Lee Kuan Yew. Some of the highlights were a rickshaw, replica WWII tank, replica 60's HDB kitchen, and LKY's Rolex watches. Definitely don't rush through this gallery - take your time and see everything. Don't skip the paintings, they are like windows into the past. Great learning opportunity.

Next I went to the Glass Rotunda. It's just like a light show. Wonderful photo and video op and cool animals. Although if you don't go - ehh, you're not really missing anything.

Lastly I checked out the second floor exhibits. The haunted spiral staircase is pretty cool! In my opinion the best exhibitions on the second floor are the Modern Colony and Surviving Syonan. Modern Colony had a lot of old dresses, shoes, etc. Very interesting to me! A museum employee (forgot to ask his name) gave me my own mini tour about how Malay became the national language of S'pore and how LKY united Singaporeans through culture. He was obviously very knowledgeable. Surviving Syonan is my favorite. It's all about the Japanese occupation of Singapore in WWII. You can hear the survivors' stories too.

On my way out I stopped by the gift store. The books are all really interesting, wish I had bought one or two. As I was getting hungry, all I got were two postcards ($1 each, not bad). I didn't go to the museum cafe, but if you are a seasoned traveler like me you would know better than to eat there.

Me and two other girlfriends walked in and we ran around like children exclaiming things like ""Ohhhh look at this!"" ""Oh wow, this is awesome!"" ""What do you use this for?!""
Laughing at the nudie cups and the Obama birth certificate dining platter.

Fish Eddy sells American made Fine China, Vintage dishes, multiple varieties of Mason Jars, tongue-in-cheek themed dishware, cake platters from the 80s and more.

I didn't even know I liked dishware that much. I was so dazzled by the cutlery and mason jars. The bridge and tunnel dining set. Love it. Do I want a wood handled steak knife? Or the European teaspoon? Or should I buy that tiny spoon with the long silver handle for 2.99 that would be perfect for sundaes and eating ice cream?

And we could have easily spent two hours in that store. 
Sometimes I feel as if I am on a treasure hunt. Do you know the feeling of walking into an antique store and finding items that you have forgotten had existed?
Or discovering a new utensil?
Have you been to a store and found a new way to use a familiar tool?
I didn't know a dishware store could be so exciting and informative.
It was like being at a strange museum.

I can honestly say that gradually building up an eclectic -- but carefully curated -- collection of dishes and glassware from these guys has actually changed my eating (and spending) habits since it makes it just a ~little~ more fun to cook and eat at home. 

If you're a local and pass by anyway from time to time, it's always worth stopping in to see what's made it over to the sale section -- the discounts are generous. 

BONUS: Fishs has an amazing network of designers, artists, activists, etc. who make appearances in the store for fun events. Specifically, for the past few years they've had (my #1 hero forever) Amy Sedaris in around the holidays to gift wrap in store purchases aaand it's just something you've gotta make time for if you love Amy and/or appreciate things that are completely ridiculous.",18/7/2018,Retail,True,Promotional content detected,152,866

I would describe the style as if Crate and Barrel and CB2 had a second cousin named Charlie who went into the dish business. Yeah, kinda like that. Fun, cute, kinda over priced, standard but unique enough to say, ""owww dhallling, I purchased this soup spoon in New York, Honey! Isn't it fabulous?!?""

What I'm most amazed with is the staff. They were 100% customer service focused and helped me ship my junk back to Atlanta. I just knew when my package arrived dented and discarded due to mishandling by Fed Excrement, my stuff was broken. NOPE! Those guys know how to pack dishes!

And yet, if I find myself walking down Broadway and passing Fishs Eddy, I can't resist going inside.  Even if I don't need anything.

There's something about the loosey goosey ambiance of the place that makes it relaxing and entertaining.  That's right, they sell plates and those plates are entertaining.  The chunky ceramics that dominate their inventory peal out ""Blue Plate Special!""  It's a casual style that can find a spot in nearly anybody's household.  And there is so much of it, different colors, patterns, funky artwork.

It's great, too, that everything is sold by the piece, so you can mix and match your settings to your hearts content or buy just as many of an item as you need.  In addition to dishes, they have great bins of flatware for just a buck or two an item.  Need eleven forks and seven spoons?  This is the place for you.  Big ol' coffee mug on a saucer for serving your homemade cappuccinos?  You'll probably have about 40 to choose from.  As is common with shops of this nature, when items move through inventory they may never return, so if you see something you want buy it then or come back right away to avoid disappointment.

Fishs Eddy,3,"Fishs Eddy was originally called ""The New Farm"" and was on east 18th street. I had a friend who called them ""Vicious Eddy"" because of the way their higher-end items can gouge you. Today I was there and they're featuring sample one-of-a-kind plates from hotels and restaurants, from about 1880-1930. They're promoting it as a way to put together quirky, one-of-a-kind table settings, but at prices from about $50 to over $500 for a plate, I think I'll stick to the hotel ware. (The way I break plates, I end up with like 3 of everything anyway.)

I've bought lots of the cheap stuff here over the years; I'm a big fan of hotel ware because it's sturdy and well-priced. 

Over the years, they've apparently had some stunningly bad marketing--I've heard from a source--but have nevertheless remained afloat. They have an outlet in Staten Island near the ferry but I've never made it there because, well, it's in Staten Island.

Hands down one of the best dining experiences we've had in NYC! Din Tai Fung lives up to the hype and more -- from its gorgeous location and stylish decor to its absolutely delicious food and exceptional service.

We started with the cucumber salad, which was refreshingly perfect. The famous xiao long bao were a huge hit with my kids -- they couldn't stop raving about how flavorful and juicy they were! As a vegetarian, I was thrilled to find so many veg and vegan options. The green beans with chili oil were perfectly crisp and spicy, and the spicy noodles were truly out of this world.

My son ordered the black pepper beef tenderloin, which he declared ""phenomenal."" But the ultimate standout? The chocolate and mochi xiao long bao with sea salt milk foam -- pure heaven in every bite!

A special shoutout to our server Karma, who gave fantastic recommendations and made the whole experience even better. We had such a blast dining here as a family.

We were seated almost immediately and guided through the menu. The vibe is very much family style, and I feel you can't go wrong with anything. We ended up grabbing a good blend of bites from the Xiao Long Bao (Pork) which were so yummy! Not my absolute favorite soup dumplings, but delicious nonetheless. The cucumber salad was not bad! Super refreshing, but I'd probably pass next time I go. The pork chop and sesame noodles were a standout -- SO well cooked, flavorful, and balanced!! Weirdly enough, the STRING BEANS were my absolute favorite though. The flavor, flash fry cooking style, and garlic was divine. I was blown away.

We ended with a mochi/chocolate dumpling with a warm salted caramel cream sauce on the side and it was incredible. Tasted like a warm hot cocoa hug!

The musts:
-Sweet & sour pork baby back ribs. Fell off the bones. Comes with 6. Could have had another order!
-Spicy pork wontons. The flavors!!!
-Chocolate & mochi xiao long bao - you bite into it and the chocolate starts flowing. Eat them in one bite or expect a mess. So rich and delicious! (add the sea salt cream)
-Sweet taro mochi xiao long bao - a surprising sweet treat (again add the sea salt cream)

Good:
-Pork fried rice
-Espresso martini - unique to the NYC location only (per the menu)
-Cucumber gin martini

Meh:
-Chicken soup dumplings (they were cold - Ive never had a cold soup dumpling)
-Cucumber salad is nothing special.
-Pork buns are a solid mound of flavorless pork

The check in experience is a little confusing at first - especially as a first timer- luckily it wasn't that crowded when we went. 

We had to wait a bit past our reservation time even though there were many empty tables and we were eventually sat. I was confused by the hostess explanation of how we could order via the QR code on the menu sheet or via our server. And then lo and behold we were suppose to also fill out the sheet regardless. Didn't know we were taking a test! 

After being school on Din Tai Fung etiquette we finally we were able to order. Our server spoke in a whisper so it was extremely hard to hear him, guess this is where the paper and pencil comes in handy! But we eventually started to get food. 

Thankfully I came here here for food and not for the ordering process because the differing types of buns and dumplings and noodles made up for the annoyances to get there.

Din Tai Fung,5,"Having been here 4x now, I can say for sure that the green beans are my favorite from here time and time again! 

Each time I come here I always make sure to have a reservation. It will minimize the wait time. The interior is dark, wooden, lamp-lit kind of vibe. Tables are close together yet far enough apart to have your own space from a different party. 

Food: Once again, I strongly recommend  the green beans! They're crunchy and full of garlic! Flavor is on point! 

My second favorite here has got to be the braised beef noodle soup! But you need to eat it while it's hot otherwise it's not good when warm/cold. It comes in a pretty big portion, would share this. Decent amount of beef and veggies. Also add chili oil to the beef if that's your thing :)

My third favorite are the spicy wontons! I tried the chicken ones and the shrimp/pork ones. The shrimp/pork ones were a little more flavorful and juicier which we absolutely loved and were considering ordering another of but we ended up being too full. 

We've also tried the pork soup dumplings, crab soup dumplings, truffle and kurobuta pork soup dumplings, and the chocolate mochi soup dumplings with a side of sea salt cream to top it off. The pork soup dumplings, though standard, were the best ones here. The truffle one while rich in taste, had too much of a lingering truffle aftertaste for us. A little truffle is good but too much can be overpowering! The chocolate mochi came highly recommended and it was good but at the same time, very sweet! 

Noodles with sesame sauce was good but you quickly get tired of this taste. Recommend putting some hot chili oil on it!  Noodles with Spicy Sauce was good! Very flavorful! Also would recommend the pork fried noodles! 

Would not recommend the cucumber salad (bland), seaweed and bean curd salad, or the pork chop fried rice. The seaweed and bean curd salad is refreshing and good to try since it's somewhat different but wouldn't order again. The pork chop fried rice was also pretty bland. 

Their boba teas are also pretty good! Not as sweet as other vendors but fulfills the craving and good to have with the meal. 

Also at this location only is their black sesame espresso martini which I absolutely loved. Hints of black sesame, stronger espresso taste! Mmm!

I loved the dark ambiance once I walked in, with the dim lights and highlights with colorful lamps.

It took a bit for someone to come and ask us for water and take our menu. However, the food came out pretty fast! They probably had one of the best summer rolls that I have ever had. The ingredients were fresh, blended well, and they put their own twist with some crunchy thing that was actually so good! Definitely needed more sauce as we were munching away. 

We were originally going to order a regular pho, but the waiter said we MUST get the wagyu pho if it is our first time here, so we were convinced. It definitely was different from the traditional pho as it was lacking a lot of the ingredients, but the broth was very rich and the meat was so tender and good! It was still very yummy. It definitely felt like a premium pho. 

 The Bun Cha Hanoi also seemed like a popular dish so we ordered it, and I was glad to see that there were plenty of veggies and noodles! I do think there should be more meat given this ratio and it was a bit hard to eat, but everything put together was still very yummy. The portion size was definitely generous and good for sharing.

La Dong,3,"Let's start with the obvious: Nothing in Manhattan (outside of Chinatown and maybe Curry Hill) is authentic to its original culinary culture anymore. If you plucked a native resident from a country like, say, Thailand and plopped them in the middle of a popular Thai restaurant in this borough, they'd cringe at the Westernization of the menu items, then cry at the prices of the items being 10x what they'd pay back home.

We don't have authentic cuisine in Manhattan, just fusion and ""elevated"". It's the only way restaurants can get away with charging the prices they do. And it gives them cover when they're inevitably criticized for authenticity by being able to say it's just ""inspired"" or ""interpreted"" or ""reimagined"" or some other marketing euphemism for ""not trying to be authentic"". You know what I'm talking about.

La Dong isn't authentic Vietnamese food, let alone authentic Vietnamese street food. It serves ""elevated"" versions of street food classics in pretty presentations in beautiful rooms with stunning decor--which no doubt pleases the clientele that skews heavily, heavily white.

The Banh Beo was the best of what we tried, as the fish sauce was on point and the rice flour was the right texture. 

On the other hand, the Banh Xeo was a colossal disappointment. I won't even get into how wrong it is to harden and waffle-ize the wrap into a taco shell (semi-points for being creative, I suppose) because that crime kind of speaks for itself. It was the filling that was felonious. Where were all the veggies and herbs? Why was it so bland? And why was each banh xeo so...effing...SMALL???

For entrees, we figured we might as well check out the classic Pho Ha Noi because if you can't get pho right, why are you even here? The broth was quite umami, and the beef--cooked two ways--was well done. But I couldn't get over the lack of fresh herbs. Where was the basil? Where was the lemongrass? Garlic and chili peppers on the SIDE and not stewing in the stock where they belong? What newfangled devilry is this, at $21 a bowl?

The only reason I'm not ruling out a return visit is that the prices weren't as shockingly high as other upscale-ified Asian restaurants in Manhattan.

Where are all the veggies and herbs that usually accompany an order of bánh xèo? Where are the characteristic crispy fried edges of the bánh xèo?

It also had a bit of spinach and a poached egg, runny yolk and when popped into the broth made it a little creamier. The broth had a nice little kick to it but wasn't overly spicy or salty. Mmm good! 

Every time, the chicken tatsuta-age is a must for an appetizer to share (or not share!). Big bite sized pieces of crispy chicken, topped with lemon juice, and spicy mayo on the side! Every piece of chicken was juicy, not dry, and best when consumed piping hot.

For dessert on the menu (by patisserie fouet), four of us shared the soba pudding and matcha tiramisu. The soba pudding was very light and had a caramelized black sugar base- sweet but not overpowering. If you want dessert that's not too sweet, and tastes close to vanilla ice cream, this is it! 

The matcha tiramisu is every matcha lover's dream. ‍... and so worth taking a lactaid for (lactose intolerance). With layers of mascarpone, green tea sponge cake and topped with toasted rice puffs, every bite was an explosion of very rich matcha taste. You need to love matcha to really enjoy this dessert and I absolutely loved it. It also wasn't too sweet either! 

Overall, I can foresee myself coming back here again and again and am glad they expanded for more space! Service was exceptional as always!",26/1/2025,Food & Beverage,True,Excessive punctuation,328,1792
Raku,5,"Raku is one of my favorite udon restaurants in NYC! Must try if you're visiting from out of town!

I always go for the Niku, gyunan, or the curry udon! The udon has the perfect level of bounciness. You can't go wrong with anything your order here! 


Tip: Expect a 20 min-1 hour wait if you go during lunch or dinner rush. They don't do Resy! The restaurant is small so, this place isn't the best for large parties

Raku,4,"All my friends from New York have raved about this place so I had to come by and give this place a shot! The noodles are SO CHEWY and are hand pulled. Definitely worth trying. 

The flavors of the broth are very rich and thick. The NIKU udon tastes very similar to Korean braised beef broth, which felt a little heavy for my liking. I did order a side of spicy/chili oil which helped clear my palate. NIKU is one of their most popular dishes! 

The cold udon (I forgot name) was very refreshing, something similar to soba noodles. 

Lastly, the Shichiken tasted similar to something in the ball park of chicken noodle soup. If you like chicken noodle soup, you will definitely like this one! There is also 2 pieces of mochi inside, which was fun to eat!!!

The entrance can be a little confusing -- first you enter through a black door, and through the bakery in the front. Make sure to walk all the back and you will be able to find RAKU. Service was great, VERY attentive, and slightly asks you a lot of questions HAHAHA (but  I think it is to ensure you have all your needs accommodated for)",25/10/2024,Food & Beverage,True,Excessive punctuation,204,1094
Raku,5,"wow. this udon was literally the best i've had in my life so far. the texture of the udon was unmatched. it was so soft but chewy and bouncy at the same time. you could really tell it was handmade! the broth was also good! very light and clean tasting~ we got the yasai kakiage which is veggie tempura. the veggies included carrot, onion, eggplant, and bell pepper! it was battered well and not soggy! light and airy! 

we also got an agedashi tofu as an appetizer but we originally wanted their sabazushi (they were sold out) the agedashi tofu was good too! no complaints 

service was good as well. very attentive and accommodating 

the interior is very minimalist and a little upscale! feels refined~

Raku,5,"Really great udon!!! We luckily were able to get a table for dinner without having to wait, so I was excited for that! We started off with a full order (10 pieces) of the karaage. In hindsight, we would have been ok with a half order (6pieces). It was good, but it wasn't the best I've had.

Hubby got the wagyu udon which was very very good! Would def recommend this one! I got the Kani ankake. It was snow crab in thick egg soup. Don't order this one if you aren't a fan of thick egg soup, but it's def a great option if you enjoy! Overall, service was good and the ambiance was cozy like most NYC restaurants. Def worth checking out if you enjoy udon.",20/5/2024,Food & Beverage,True,Excessive punctuation,128,654
Raku,5,"Hands down my favorite udon place! I've been to their other location in Soho many times before Covid and recently this one. This location is TINY. Their outdoor seatings seem bigger than their indoor. I personally like the other location better but the food is still just as delicious . I went on a Saturday evening and waited about 30mins to be seated after putting my name down. You can join the waitlist on yelp actually. 

I always get the tantan udon which is a delicious spicy miso with minced pork and their fried chicken that is cooked to perfection. Their udon is just absolutely the best. So chewy and the broth flavor is absorbed into the noodles so every bite is just *chefs kiss*. This time we decided to also try their pork gyoza and wow we were surprised at how good it was. It was just so juicy and had a good amount of meat filling. 

I love this place. Highly recommend!!!!!",11/12/2023,Food & Beverage,True,Excessive punctuation,164,892
Raku,5,"My absolute favorite spot for udon. I cannot even believe I'm saying this because I don't usually like udon. 
I had ordered their Washugyu Yaki Udon and the beef wasn't even the best part! The udon was! I can just eat two whole bowls of udon with soup and nothing else!!! 
They are usually packed and have a line out the door since the place is super small. (They do have outdoor dining for now) so make sure to come early!",2/10/2023,Food & Beverage,True,Excessive punctuation,81,423
Raku,5,"ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! Raku is my GO. TO. spot for delicious udon when the weather is cold. The chewy, bouncy texture of the noodles here is ELITE, and the broth doesn't feel heavy at all - a win in my book!! A classic to get is the Gyunan, but their Niku also never disappoints, as the bowl is packed with delicious meat toppings. 

I love that they give a refreshing, frozen grape to close off the meal, and the service is super attentive.  Overall an 11/10 and chef's kiss all around!!",2/11/2023,Food & Beverage,True,Excessive punctuation,90,489

Douraku Sushi,5,"First time trying out douraku sushi by Tung lok, their Donburi was awesome! The quality of the food way surpass the price of it. Look at my photo below and you will understand why.

<bora chirashi don> we are usually quite selective when comes to sashimi as we are concerned about the freshness. To our surprise not only the look is appealing, the cut was pretty fresh too! Yumz

<Unagi don> pleasant to find that it comes with an onsen egg and jelly fish salad too. Love the egg as it add on to the moisture of the rice. The only thing that, the unagi is on the slightly saltier side, it would have been perfect if it’s lighter in the marination.

Both dons come with a seaweed soup too! Can you believe it that above order only cost $16? Yes.. it’s super worth it!!!",2021-10-16T02:29:46.419Z,food and beverages,True,Excessive punctuation,145,768

Disappointed with the In-Store Experience on 5 June

I visited the store on 5 June at around 12 PM, intending to place an order at the counter. Despite two staff members being inside, no one acknowledged me or offered any assistance while I stood waiting. It wasn’t until I had to call out to them that I was told to scan a QR code and place my order online.

This was extremely frustrating and felt dismissive. I had purposely come down to order in person, but instead was made to go through the hassle of signing in digitally just to get a pizza. If customers aren’t allowed to place orders at the counter, then what is the point of having one?

The entire experience felt impersonal and inconvenient. I hope Domino’s reconsiders this system and allows walk-in customers the option of ordering directly with staff.",2025-06-07T10:02:31.988Z,food and beverages,True,Promotional content detected,146,819

McDonald's,1,"Advice for those who want fast orders from this place:

Just do Pick Up orders, for some reason they just like to prioritize orders that are pick up rather than dine in options.

Also don’t do any coupon redemptions from this place. They like to always push those orders to the back of the queue. And they also like to screw up the coupon redemption orders as well.

Unless you want to wait for 1+ hours (legit if I haven’t asked for a refund I would probably be waiting till lunch hours), just follow these steps.

Or do mobile orders, they sure love to do mobile orders as there are always 10+ mobile orders done already but left on the counter for like 30+ mins.",2024-03-11T02:32:00.596Z,food and beverages,True,Promotional content detected,125,665

Captain's Table,5,"1st time we are at this restaurant with 2 table booked (22 pax) one week in advance.
Making use of their NDP 95 promo that came in a set comprising Seabass, prawn & spring chicken@$95/set.
We also order peking duck,
fishmaw crab soup, coffee pork ribs, tofu shimeji,redbean pancake,hot yam paste,mango pomelo, heineken, steam rice,coke,chinese tea,braised peanuts.
I am so glad my family enjoyed all the food so much as it were everybody 1st  despite some delayed at the last minute where more diners started to walk-in. The manager offers his apologise & fill our 2 tables with complimentary food which we really appreciated.
I must said:
the steam prawn is exceptionally fresh & nice, the fried seabass is so flavorful, chicken is so yummy & juicy, tofu is crisp & soft, fishmaw is thick with ingredients,
a ""WOW"" to the pancake,
yam paste is thick with gingko nuts, ribs is tender & crisp.
Peking duck come with 2 combi flavour that need to order in advance.
I am not a noodle person but the remaining duckmeat fried with noodle caught me by surprise. Light & refreshing.
As most member of the family are taught to cook when we were young we find all the food are flavourful, not salty nor sweet. We had a bountiful stomach after having our meal. Everybody said affordable & worth.
Menu & price can be located in the website.
Thanks to the manager & his dedicated staff were serving us well.

Captain's Table,5,"disclaimer: they’re a little understaffed, so service and food may be slower for this place. I don’t mind as I like to take my time with food!

Wonderful place to have dinner at - the sunset views are stunning at the correct hour.

Fish maw soup: Very balanced. Just the right saltiness and texture. Have a little sip first before adding in (just a little bit of!) vinegar and pepper to taste the difference.

Stir fried scallops with asparagus in truffle: interestingly good! In many dishes I’ve had, the truffle taste is stronger (and after a while it gets overpowering), but in this dish it was just a hint - a really delicate highlight to compliment the dish as a whole. Asparagus texture was just right - easy to chew but not too crunchy.

Stir fried kurobuta (black pork) in black pepper sauce: very tender!

Peking duck: must order in advance! Make a reservation and order in advance due to the preparation the kitchen must make prior to the meal. I really love the “pastry” they use to wrap the skin for the meal, it’s thin and fragrant. They’ll serve it half with cucumber and half with spring onion. For the second round, you can choose to have it one out of several ways (if I remember correctly : fried rice, stir fried with e-mian, salt and pepper stir fried, ginger/garlic and onion stir fry, or just chopped up and served).

Mango and pomelo was nice and fragrant, not too thick but also not too watery.

Deep fried Red bean pancake: MUST ORDER. Can’t stress this enough; this was actually so good. Exterior was wonderfully crispy without being too oily, and the red bean paste in the middle was fragrant and delicious. Got a “not too sweet” of approval from family members! (ps: you should probably order this dessert slightly ahead of time, not at the end of the meal but maybe before your second last or last dish arrives since it takes time to prepare by hand.)

Star of the whole meal was service staff Simon, who also did the table side Peking duck serving. Very charismatic and charming. Will definitely come back again!

Total was around 300+ for 5 people.

(Do ask them for parking ticket discount coupon if you’re dining in without membership. Gives a 4 dollar discount, equivalent to two hours of parking I think!)",2025-07-05T14:23:30.262Z,food and beverages,True,Promotional content detected; Excessive punctuation,399,2240

Greenhouse Bistro,4,"This is probably one of the most westerly restaurants (the other being the one at Raffles Marina near the second link) in Singapore. Located in Tuas West, this restaurant is located in a 'ulu' industrial flat, amongst factories and industrial buildings.
The Place:
The hugh dining hall was decorated with many posters of food and LED wordings on the walls, which, together with the plastic plants, seem somewhat crowded and tacky. The bar counter was too crowded with equipments and utensils, and was overshadowed by the large posters hanging over it. The decor could improve with a better interior designer.
The Food
I had the truffles olio aglio pasta with New Zealand ribeye. The pasta was perfectly cooked, with a nice degree of al-dente. The truffles oil add a hint of umami to the olive oil-based sauce, without overpowering it. The ribeye was a bit tough, probably due to the lack of marbling of the New Zealand steak, but was well cooked and not dry, attesting to the skill and care of the chef. The addition of black cavier on the steak, although did not add to the flavour, however did enhance the presentation of the dish. The restaurant was having a promotion of Japanese oysters - $1 for each raw oyster. The plump oyster tasted full of briny freshness, and was creamy in textual.
Conclusion

Tenderbest,1,"Extremely disappointing experience at Tenderbest. The service was appalling from start to finish. The cashier was curt and dismissive, showing zero interest in engaging respectfully with customers. Staff behind the counter were equally indifferent, with no sense of urgency or basic courtesy.

To make matters worse, the food was served carelessly — portions were sloppily thrown together with no regard for presentation or hygiene. This is not what I expect from a brand that positions itself as a reputable F&B establishment.

What truly added insult to injury was the payment process. A QR code for online payment was clearly displayed, yet when I attempted to use it, I was abruptly told it was cash only. No signage, no warning — just a blunt refusal and poor attitude. This kind of miscommunication reflects very poorly on the management. It’s 2025 — cash-only operations without proper notice are unacceptable.

This outlet needs serious retraining on customer service, basic professionalism, and operational clarity. Until then, I won’t be returning — and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone expecting a minimally decent dining experience.",2025-06-04T05:31:50.927Z,food and beverages,True,Promotional content detected,180,1145

El Complejo del Barrio Chino es el mayor centro de vendedores ambulantes de Singapur, con más de 200 puestos de comida. Es el corazón de la cultura de los vendedores ambulantes, declarada por la UNESCO (*). Cuenta igualmente con una amplia gama de puestos y productos diversos en la planta baja, junto con un.mercado de mariscos y productos del dia en el sótano. También hay servicios públicos.

(*) La cultura ambulante de
Singapur fue inscrita con éxito
como el primer elemento
de Singapur en la Lista
Representativa del Patrimonio
Cultural Inmaterial de la
Humanidad de la UNESCO el
16 de diciembre de 2020. EI
Comité Intergubernamental
dio su apoyo unánime a la
inscripción de la cultura
ambulante en Singapur...
Cultura de vendedores ambulantes en Singapur: la comida comunitaria y las prácticas culinarias en un contexto urbano multicultural están.presentes en todo Singapur. Los vendedores ambulantes preparan una variedad de comida (xcomida de ambulante》) para quienes cenan y conviven en los centros de venta ambulante. Estos centros funcionan como 《comedores comunitarios》 donde personas de diversos orígenes se reúnen y comparten la experiencia de comer durante el desayuno, el almuerzo y la cena. También se realizan actividades como partidas de ajedrez, actuaciones callejeras y sesiones de improvisación artistica.
Evolucionados a partir de la cultura de la comida callejera, los centros de venta ambulante se han convertido en un símbolo de Singapur como ciudad-estado multicultural, que abarca las culturas china, malaya, india y otras. Los vendedores ambulantes se inspiran en la confluencia de estas culturas, adaptando los platos a los gustos y contextos locales. Hoy en día, los centros de venta ambulante en todo Singapur continúan atendiendo las necesidades de diversas comunidades en distritos
residenciales, recreativos y laborales. Algunos de los vendedores ambulantes más antiguos comenzaron su actividad en la década de 1960. Muchos se especializan en un plato en particular, perfeccionado a lo largo de los años, y transmiten sus recetas, conocimientos y habilidades a familiares más jóvenes o aprendices. Las organizaciones comunitarias, las organizaciones no gubernamentales y las instituciones educativas desempeñan un papel fundamental en la promoción y el mantenimiento de la cultura ambulante mediante programas de capacitación, eventos y proyectos de documentación. Como espacio social que acoge a personas de diversos origenes socioeconómicos, los centros ambulantes desempeñan un papel crucial en la mejora de las
interacciones comunitarias y el fortalecimiento del tejido social.

ROBO-T,5,"Can’t wait to taste their salad bowl, tea and acai bowl. Also wish there’s a few vegan pastries and desserts on their menu!

There’s waiting area to sit at while your salad is being prepared. Or you can preorder it too!

I got my hands on their basic salad bowl.
They’re generous with the sauces. I love how their salad ordering sheet is categorised, so you can choose the veggies and flavours going into your bowl.

They ran out of roasted sweet potato pretty quickly. So I swapped it with potato instead.
I feel it’s a lil too salty for me. But if your salt tolerance is high, you won’t feel it.

There’s staff discount for people working in Surbana Jurong building .

Pig’s Organ Soup,5,"Super nice dining experience.
I recommend people to go try it and I can guarantee you guys won't regret it.
Hidden in an industrial area.
Went on a Saturday late morning.
Not crowded at all!
Super nice uncle!
Super generous portion!
Super reasonably priced!
What else more can people expect?
Perfect!
Ordered a pig organ soup with white rice.
To my extremely pleasant surprise, uncle not only poured some braised sauce over my bowl of what's supposed to be just plain white rice, he also topped it up with a piece of his super flavourful tau pok!
And as if that wasn't pleasant enough, uncle even offered to top up my soup if needed!
I must say this.
This definitely is one of the nicest meals of my life!

Connect71 Cafe,4,"Located a tad bit out of the way from the well-trafficked areas of NTU's North Spine and I've only known this place rather recently. Surprisingly popular among some students and staffs - there is always crowds around lunch time, perhaps the 10% discount of all items on sale for them is one of the main draws.

Discount aside, the offerings are actually pretty good given the price, albeit the Japanese and Japanese-inspired noodle dishes' portion is somewhat smaller than average for most people. The coffee is one of the very bests in NTU and very competitively priced ($3 for long black/espresso after discount). Don't expect the variety like real speciality coffee place like let's say Venture Drive, but they are know what they are doing - the coffee I've had was chocolaty, a bit velvety, and came with right 'body' and thickness.

Due to its popularity, the indoor space is very crowded in lunch time, but the outdoor dining space (next to a rooftop garden) is almost always empty. Some shading (even patio table with umbrella) would do, especially in hot weather.",2025-02-06T13:10:02.488Z,food and beverages,True,Promotional content detected,182,1071

Crave Nasi Lemak,1,"No STAR for all!!!

I have unpleasant experience with your foods and staffs. Firstly, I have encountered few times that I need to wait for longer time after payment made at kiosk.Hence this time,I ordered thru foodpanda as pick up order cos I have bad experience on waiting.

I have arrived 11:20 after ordering as the app stated 11:12 for pick up time.
To my horror, I didn't see a trace of my order. I asked the counter staff when will my order be ready, she shouted oh Foodpanda order.  Coming coming.... I sat quietly and waited awhile n approached them again the lady said 10mins so I walked out and get my other stuffs.
When I went bk,the order still not ready, with no choice as I already paid for the food so I waited another 10mins. After good 15mins, I went to ask again they replied unhappily not ready not ready !! Pardon me,I should be the one who feel unhappy cos I waited far too long!!!
Your staffs seem not organized and take a longer time for preparation.
Once opened the box, the fried chicken skin is burnt and hard due to high heat!!

Hope the management can help to educate your staffs with time management and effectiency.",2025-02-08T16:45:53.033Z,food and beverages,True,Excessive punctuation,211,1145

Hi Noodle,1,第5次来吃，食物的质量明显下降了，下午1点多可能不是饭点吧，土豆丝颜色明显不对，像剩菜，麻婆豆腐味道也只剩下豆腐，没有麻婆味道，肉沫茄子也是茄子吃起来不新鲜，土豆牛腩土豆不错可是牛腩肉比较硬，除了土豆丝，其他菜都是温凉的，不知道是炉子的火不够热，还是菜放的时间太久了，还记得前几次来食物十分新鲜，全都是都是热腾腾的，今天不知道怎么了，感觉差了很多，是换老板了？还是换厨子了？还是换店长了？西部好吃的店不多，希望嗨一碗能保持原有的食材服务质量。,2025-03-23T06:24:31.744Z,food and beverages,True,Too few words (1 < 10); Repetitive content,1,221
