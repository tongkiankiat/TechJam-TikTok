Little Woods Montessori,5,"We are so grateful that our son's first school experience was with Little Woods. We visited 16 Montessori schools to select the best and most authentic Montessori school and Little Woods was the best one. Pro: School Director's teacher learned directly from Maria Montessori in Sri Lanka (the closest lineage one could find), aircon, loving, kind and passionated teachers, fun outdoor space with cars, tricycle and garden, clean, quality montessori equipments, wonderful yearly show for all classes, comprehensive quarterly reports, communication app, regular photo reports).",2024-08-06T10:15:37.546Z,education
Little Woods Montessori,5,"We’ve enrolled our youngest child in LWM once we arrived in Singapore. It’s been nearly two years and we highly recommend. The teachers are warm, caring and well-rounded. My daughter loves going to school each day and enjoys her time there.",2024-07-23T07:29:53.340Z,education
Little Woods Montessori,5,"LWM is a fantastic school.  We did not want a place that would be too heavy with academics on an 18-month-old but rather a place that would teach our daughter how to socialize, learn about the world, make friendships and have the type of school experience every 18-month-old should have.  We got that and more.  Such caring teachers and administrators, a bright friendly atmosphere and a focus on excellence in what they do, makes LWM a great place.  Highly recommended.",2020-03-18T04:03:40.584Z,education
Little Woods Montessori,5,"I had stalled sending my son (second child) to preschool after we moved to Singapore simply because I could not find a preschool that was as wonderful as the school his older sister had attended in our home country. I visited what seemed like every single preschool in our area and none of them ""clicked"" for me. That was until I visited Little Woods Montessori in Gentle Road. From the moment I stepped into the light, bright and beautiful ground-floor converted home - I knew I had finally found my son's preschool! The surroundings are so wonderful for a young child, it really feels like a home away from home rather than a learning institution. I was most impressed that day by witnessing what the children were doing. The activities are so wonderful for the body and mind. My son has absolutely thrived at Little Woods Montessori over the past two years. His fine motor skills are absolutely amazing and his knowledge of the world is beyond his years! The teaching and environment has been so incredibly nurturing. It is wonderful that they get to play outside on the grass playground in the fresh air every day! I have always felt that my son has been in safe hands and the teacher to student ratio is very low so they really get to know your child so well. As a family we have greatly enjoyed the Open House exhibitions over the years and have been amazed by what our son has created. Our only regret has been that we did not keep our son at Little Woods the whole way through until Age 6. We moved him after two years to his older sister's international school for the sake of convenience. At the international school, he is just a ""number"" and I have now realised just how incredibly high the teaching standards and care were at Little Woods! So I would have two pieces of advice for anyone wishing to send their child to a preschool in Singapore: First, you cannot go past Little Woods Montessori for the environment and quality of teaching and care. Second: Leave your child at Little Woods for as long as you can, you will find the standards of teaching and care at the ""big"" or international schools do not compare! We miss Little Woods so much and are very thankful for the incredible time our son has had there and for all of the valuable things that he has learnt.",2020-02-27T03:20:06.241Z,education

BMTC School 4 (Rocky Hill Camp),5,"Tired of staying in the city center? This resort is the perfect getaway!

After a 1h transit from the far East of Singapore, you can disconnect from the world in a place where signals literally cannot reach! Let your mind and body recharge with the relaxing view of the rainforest for as far as the eye can see, and enjoy ready-made meals designed to optimize nutritional content! At night, you can enter a deep, peaceful slumber to the soothing sounds of machine gun fire and grenades.

There are plenty of activities to keep you entertained! From the concrete running track in the middle of an unsheltered field, to the swimming pool that is chlorinated on a regular basis, you'll find yourself in top physical shape in no time! You can interact with exotic wildlife, such as monitor lizards, centipedes, mangrove vipers and even king cobras! You'll also have plenty of abandoned buildings to explore at night, just don't get too friendly with any of the residents.

All these and more, for the low, low price of your hair, your NRIC, and your freedom. Book your stay now!",2025-07-03T04:34:27.627Z,education

BMTC School 4 (Rocky Hill Camp),5,Best resort in Tekong.,2024-07-08T23:44:35.172Z,education
BMTC School 4 (Rocky Hill Camp),5,"I would definitely recommend staying at this resort for all tourists planning to visit Rocky Hill Nature Reserve. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in the deluxe 16-man forest villa as our suite enjoyed a panoramic forest view, as well as a beautiful view of the hotel lobby (parade square) from the balcony. Guests of the resort are sure to encounter some of the exotic native wildlife such as primates, bats and several avian species. If you are lucky, you may also be able to partake in a unique safari experience where the wildlife comes inside the villa itself, offering you a more intimate and unique experience. However, guests are advised to hide any snacks inside their state of the art metal finish wardrobes. Speaking of food, the resort offers a more pleasant dining experience than the Tekong Riviera Grand Hotel, but you may find the chicken a little… medium rare but also quite dry and stringy. additionally, the fried rice or noodles are occasionally dripping with oil… how generous! despite some minor drawbacks, the bistro here certainly offers a finer dining experience than the dining halls at Ladang, and i must commend the variety of assorted free-flow beverages provided. Guests can also look forward to enjoying the weekly yacht service which shuttles them between the main island and the resort. The hotel staff are also not exactly friendly and shout at guests from time to time, but were still marginally better than what i expected before my stay here. Despite the apparent poor service of the staff, i still grew to see them with much endearment, and so did i enjoy sharing a suite with my fellow guests. Overall, i would say this is truly a unique resort concept, especially for those looking for an immersive ah boys to men experience.",2024-06-22T14:00:38.977Z,education

BMTC School 4 (Rocky Hill Camp),4,"School 4 is around 4km away from the rest of Tekong Resort's schools. Travel time depends on how fast your tonner driver wants to go and whether he cares about passenger comfort when going over the 1001 speed bumps on Tekong Highway.

Here is the place where you really feel like you're in the army. You will hear the glorious sound of gunfire day and night. You will also be close to nature and experience real-life combat when you have to fend off monkey raids. If you're lucky, you might even come across a pangolin.

Despite its remote location, Rocky Hill has everything you need - well-equipped medical facilities, a swimming pool and the best food on Pulau Tekong. Like the other schools, you will also have a complimentary 5-day outdoors experience, where you can bathe in the organic and natural mud of Pulau Tekong.

And to recruits, if you end up here you can give up on your M1 subscription. M1 never works here.",2023-05-08T06:09:44.914Z,education

Since you’re far away from the ferry terminal you’re treated to lovey unobstructed views of tekong scenery and a great big blue sky though personally the workout program for guests have us facing the ground more than the sky.

If you survive this, you'll survive anything the world throws at you.

Don't go toilet alone btw, call your buddy to follow you.

Basic Military Training Centre,5,"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ""Best All-Inclusive Bootcamp Experience in Singapore!""
Where else in Singapore can you get free food, free transport, free lodging and still get paid for showing up? That’s right — welcome to NS, the country’s most exclusive all-male wellness retreat (ladies, your turn is coming 👀).
Think of it as a 2 months-long all-expenses-paid bootcamp:
Meals provided (portion-controlled for maximum gains!)
Transport included (you will march to your destination)
Accommodation in charming shared rooms with authentic military décor (read: bunk beds and no aircon)
Fitness plan so effective, you’ll never need a gym membership again.
Weight gain? Not possible. You’ll lose calories just from standing still under the sun.
The staff (affectionately known as sergeants) are super hands-on and very vocal with feedback. Sometimes they yell, but it’s only because they care... deeply about uniform standards.
Highly recommended for anyone aged 18+ with a strong sense of patriotism, or at least no legal way to say no.
Pro tip: Always carry a water bottle, and never — never — ask “Why?”. Just say “Yes, Sergeant!” and everything will be fine.",2025-07-04T08:04:50.616Z,education

MindChamps PreSchool @ Pasir Ris,5,"Our son has been attending MindChamps Pasir Ris for the past two months, and our experience so far has been very positive. As a first-time mother who practiced full-time caregiving for the first 18 months, transitioning to preschool was a big step—not just for our son, but for us as well.

While he still cries at drop-off, he now verbalises that he enjoys school and adores his teachers. We’re especially grateful for Ms Banu, Gu Lao Shi, and Ms Pearlyn, who have shown great patience, care, and attentiveness. Their nurturing approach has made a meaningful impact, and we’ve noticed our son learning to respect both authority and his peers—something we truly appreciate.

The recent parent-teacher conference only reinforced our trust in the school. During the 45-minute session, Ms Pearlyn and Ms Banu took the time to understand our concerns and worked with us to brainstorm practical, thoughtful strategies tailored to our son's needs. It was clear they see him as an individual, and we felt genuinely supported as partners in his development.

The school itself is clean, very new, and well-maintained. We also appreciate the emphasis on sensory play and Chinese language exposure. A big plus: our son hasn’t fallen sick once since he started, which speaks volumes about the hygiene standards in place.

One small point of feedback would be the lighting—it tends to be on the cooler side, like in an office. We hope there might be a way to introduce warmer lighting in certain areas to create a cozier, more relaxed vibe.

Overall, we absolutely recommend MindChamps Pasir Ris. The teachers are dedicated, the environment is safe and enriching, and most importantly, our child is learning and growing in a space where he feels seen, supported, and secure.",2025-06-05T03:18:08.362Z,education
MindChamps PreSchool @ Pasir Ris,5,"We recently enrolled our child in the playgroup at the Pasir Ris Mall center, and it’s been such a positive experience so far.

The teachers have been incredibly patient, caring, and clearly take pride in what they do. They work so well as a team and create a warm, welcoming environment for all the children.

We really appreciate how they bring in extra support when needed and keep us updated on our child’s progress—it’s reassuring to know that they’re so attentive and proactive. I am writing this after just one week of school,  we can see our child slowly settling in and adjusting to the new routine, which brings us a lot of comfort.

MindChamps PreSchool @ Pasir Ris,5,"My 21 month old daughter has recently started PG with Mind champs at Pasir Ris and had a great experience with the school. We actually enrolled her into another premium school previously but felt very uncomfortable with the school just after 2 days as we felt the teachers were “too busy” and too overwhelmed to care for her. It felt like she was just one of the numbers in the class. The experience left me and my husband very heartbroken as we were disappointed to see our precious child being neglected at school. However, the experience with Mind champs Pasir Ris mall was a total positive change. Ms Banu (English teacher) Gu Lao Shi (Chinese teacher ) and Ms Kwee Xin (music teacher) were extremely caring and dedicated. They made sure to help my daughter feel at ease, welcomed and gave her the necessary care and attention she needed, even helped to feed and try to finish her meals when she was not adept at using the spoon (the previous school wouldn’t bother and would just remove her food once the time was up if it wasn’t touched ) . We as parents feel blessed and grateful that we found this school under Mrs Koh and Ms Pearlyn’s leadership where they hire teachers who genuinely love children. Our daughter almost immediately loved her teachers and would even tell us that she wants to go to school just after 1 week of starting.

MindChamps Performing Arts PreSchool @ Changi Business Park,5,"Mindchamps @ CBP has given us parents a peace of mind for the 5yrs that our child has been with the school from PG-K2. Our child  has always enjoyed going to Mindchamps and looks forward to interacting with his classmates and teachers.

The teachers throughout his Mindchamps journey has been nothing but wonderful. Caring, loving and with a passion to nurture, our child has blossomed in the time he has spent with them. The school environment is very clean and hygienic, school culture warm and welcoming. The outdoor area is a major plus point for us when choosing a preschool as we very much wanted outdoor play for our child. The outdoor space also doubles up as learning venue for a different kind of exposure and learning experience for the kids.

The Mindchamps programmes are very interesting and we appreciate that they encourage exploratory learning with the kids. Themes are set through each term with activities focusing  around the various themes. Lessons as I hear from our child are interesting, lively and very enjoyable. It’s a brilliant way for young minds to learn. Kudos to the teachers for always going the extra mile to creatively impart knowledge.

Feedback from us parents are taken seriously and always addressed promptly which is something we appreciate a lot. Parent teacher conferences are held periodically on top of the updates we get on our child. This is always welcomed - afterall it is a partnership between us parents and teachers.

It is hard to say goodbye to such a great preschool. Our son speaks very fondly still of his preschool days and has asked for frequent visits back. It has been one of our best decisions to enrol him in Mindchamps!",2023-03-08T12:59:31.992Z,education
MindChamps Performing Arts PreSchool @ Changi Business Park,5,"MindChamps CBP has a team of dedicated teachers led by Principal Anu- who put in their hearts to nurture young minds.
Our experience with the school, has been nothing but amazing- right from highlighting details about the child’s progress and potential, to encouraging the child with patience every step of the way-the teachers have always had and have ‘the child first’ policy.

Aside the learning and thinking skills imparted, when combined with dance and drama (also an integrated part of the curriculum), truly ensures that the child is blossoming comprehensively- and what’s more, these are not empty words- we can vouch as a first hand experience of this with our child :).

Asides this, what we also really like about the infrastructure/ space of this school - is that unlike a few other preschools which are located in malls etc- this one has a playground- which is really great as the kids can get to be in a more “natural” environment while the teachers oversee all the play activities.

Finally, a very important factor in considering MindChamps CBP has always been how welcoming, engaged and receptive the whole team is right from the start- they always allays any concerns and address any questions the parents may have and this give us the confidence to know that our child is in a safe and conducive environment geared for growth.",2023-03-05T06:23:20.679Z,education

MindChamps Performing Arts PreSchool @ Changi Business Park,5,"Wonderful preschool! As a working mum, the staff and teachers at Mindchamps CBP make it so easy for me to juggle work commitments without having to worry about my child's well being and development.

Perfect outdoor and indoor location where kids have a dedicated area for waterplay and their own playground! This was important to us as we wanted our child to spend time in the sun too! Teachers also incorporated learning in the outdoor play to help kids to truly understand concepts.

Teachers are prompt in responding to parents and always see themselves as a team with parents. This is a wonderful way of raising kids. In PG and Nursery, the focus is very much on social skills and interacting well with others while still keeping up with academic developments. In kindergarten, teachers focus on building independence with the kids and preparing them for primary school. Mindchamps CBP also has drama, ballet and music classes so kids are kept actively engaged in their interests.

Food menus are shared with parents in advanced so you know what your kids are being fed. Always lovingly cooked fresh and kids also have sessions where they try their hand at preparing simple dishes.

It was a Friday, they took down our inquiry as the principal was not around. Shortly after we received a response from the principal and arranged for show around the school. We thought it was a small compound from the outside but we were wrong, as the school went through a renovation in 2018/2019 to expand its facility. The principal explained and shared patiently what we asked as we were anxious to find a school for our daughter. She assured us that the teachers have been working with them for many years as we do not want to stress our child with high teacher turnover. My daughter cried for 1st month as she was unfamiliar with the routine, fast forward 5 months later she is enjoying school everyday. The teacher will update us if they notice if my daughter was feeling unwell, recently she had an ear infection. We felt that we picked the right school for her as the teachers’s care and attention were most important. Recently we celebrated ur daughter’s birthday at school, we are surprised that teachers and principal coordinated with us as we like to have unicorn-theme (we supplied the balloons) and our daughter was thrilled when she saw the decoration. She was over the moon! To the teachers, this is one of the many celebrations they had but it meant something special for us as we didn’t expect that they were so supportive.

I have a mummy friend from another childcare whose son hospitalized because of pneumonia, she said it is common, I was surprised to hear because my children seldom have flu attending the school here.

I know of my son's classmates who left this school because they shifted house and told me how they miss this school because the new school teachers lack the dedication to communicate with the parents and cant handle the kids, always calling them to pick the kids up for small issues, disrupting their work.

This childcare has very good dedicated teachers, good communication between parents and cleanliness. My children fall sick minimally, accidents almost never happen, its very important, so I can focus on my job.

Little Gryphons Montessori,5,"If you're looking for a school where your child will develop both valuable academic and life skills while building meaningful friendships, and looking forward to going to school every morning, look no further.

My son has been attending Little Gryphons Montessori since he was 3 years old. He's now 6 and preparing to say goodbye to the school and the friends he's made over the years. Looking back, I can say for a fact that I have never once regretted enrolling him at Little Gryphons (LG).

This is a school rooted in strong values, with lots of warmth and plenty of heart. It offers a safe, nurturing environment where children are encouraged to become confident, independent individuals. The transformation is evident — children who once arrived shy and unsure gradually blossom into bright, curious, and expressive little people who aren’t afraid to ask questions or share their thoughts. This is a testament to the school’s thoughtful unstifling approach and the positive influence of its teachers.

The school itself is well-maintained and spotless, with high-quality, mostly wooden materials that provide a calm and enriching environment for the children. I'm especially fond of the spacious layout, which emphasizes togetherness.

The teaching staff are nothing short of exceptional — nurturing, patient, and kind. They succeed in the challenging feat of making learning enjoyable for today’s children. A notable sign of the positive culture at LG is its low teacher turnover — in three years, I recall only one teacher being replaced. That level of consistency and stability speaks volumes, and is crucial in the children's development.

A heartfelt thank you to:
- Teacher Jameema, for your genuine interest in the children, your unwavering care, kindness, and dedication;
- Teacher Jess for sparking a genuine interest in Mandarin among the kids;
- Teacher Letchimi, for your irresistible bubbliness and bright energy (never change! :-));
- Peh Laoshi for your sweet, calm demeanour;

And of course, a big shoutout to Jacqueline and Terrence for setting up such a wonderful school. Little Gryphons was everything I hoped for when I was searching for a place where Adrian could thrive. I couldn’t be more proud of the thoughtful, curious, and happy little man he’s become.

To the whole Team LG: Keep up the excellent work. You’re shaping young lives in the most beautiful way - we will miss you all dearly!

Little Gryphons Montessori,5,"My experience of Little Gryphons:

In January 2018 we enrolled our daughter of 19 months to Little Gryphons Montessori School.

As a working mummy, with a new baby on the way, we knew she would be needing some extra interaction with other children and wanted to settle her in before the baby arrived.  As an expat in Singapore this is not a decision we took lightly as in the UK usually we would wait a few years before play groups and any form of education began.

We visited with Little Gryphons and spoke to several teachers who talked very thoroughly through their Montessori approach daily routine and activities. After sitting down and talking with the teachers we were bowled over with the LOVE, PASSION and DRIVE expressed by all of them.

We left the meeting feeling overwhelmed and truly confident that this was the right descision and perfect school for our daughter.  She started off on 3 mornings a week from 9:00AM – 12:30 AM.  Now nearly 3 yrs old we have increased to 4 mornings as we can’t keep her away!  She is progressing with leaps and bounds (literally).  She smiles every day, sings all day long and her vocabulary is amazing.

While there is a stairway up to the school, it is really not an issue. Once though the door it opens up into a beautiful warm, CLEAN, colourful friendly environment with lots of wonderful artwork and pictures all over the wall.  All of the toys, books and school equipment is of the highest standard which to me this seemed to lack in some of the other schools we had visited.

You are met every morning by a very friendly face and my daughter can not wait to go in to learn and play with her friends.

The teachers here truly do an EXCELLENT job in making sure all the children are happy and extremely well looked after, without failing to follow up with mummy via text messages if there is any concern at all.  On a weekly basis you are sent updates and photos of how they are getting on which also gives you a nice insight into their morning activities.

Little Gryphons Montessori is true to their mission and I can definitely say we could not be happier with the experience they provide …

“Our goal is to provide a safe, loving and supportive environment for children to grow and learn in. We aim to foster creativity, encourage curiosity and instil within children a behaviour of independent learning and self-confidence in order to have an enduring and positive impact on the child’s life.”

Woodlands Secondary School,5,"I am really proud to share that I was a woodlander even today. The school leaders and teachers nurtured students who wanted to strive regardless of their background.

The school provided students with several opportunities to participate in competitions and programmes based on their ability instead of just academic performance in tests and exams.

I learnt several life skills, which are  quintessential in my character development till today by being a Peer Support under Mrs Lim, a Camp instructor under Mr Gary Ong, and leadership and values under Mr Thiru. The school provided several learning and life experiences for students like me, who never would have been able to do so unless I was the cream of the cohort in other top-tier schools. I genuinely believe that the school’s holistic approach does its utmost in packaging every student with the knowledge and skills as leaders and better citizens as they graduate from the school as a gift to society.

Every paper my child brought home was clearly labeled with her name and what she was learning when she created it, and the food and uniform items she took to school each day came back neatly with her every afternoon.

My child was always happy to go to Lumiere each day, and I'm extremely grateful for everything Lumiere taught her and exposed her to. As a result of her time at this school, she has excelled from a very young age. I highly recommend Lumiere Montessori House!

Lumiere Montessori House @ Serangoon,5,"Our boy started at Lumiere at the end of March 2022. Unfortunately, we did not have a good experience with an earlier school and we were a bit wary! But right from the start,  the teachers were very approachable, supportive and reassuring!  Within such a short span,  I can see noticable difference in my son in a lot of areas. For instance his communication skills- he is much more articulate, has picked up another language (sings Chinese songs),  is learning to interact slowly with other kids (which was very difficult for him ) and most importantly enjoys the pre-school experience itself!! He speaks fondly of his teachers and all the fun activities that they make him do! He is starting to make friends at school and looks forward to spending time there.  Thank you so much Ms Serene,  Ms Bridget,  Ms Yvone,  Ms Karena and all the rest of you for making such a positive impact on him in such a short span of time. From crying to go to his earlier school to actually looking forward to coming to Lumiere,  this is quite a shift!!
I can't wait to see how much more he will evolve over the next couple of years in his journey at Lumiere with all of your support.  Look forward to our full day partnership moving forward.  Heartfelt gratitude for all your care, support and nurturing! Hope that you can make a similar difference with many more kids and their families! For parents looking for an amazing preschool experience for their little ones, highly recommend Lumiere.",2022-06-06T01:42:25.087Z,education

Lumiere Montessori House @ Serangoon,5,"As a 32month old child, our son joined Lumiere. We were convinced he’d take a month to settle in. He was excited to go to school after 2days!! Such was the start enabled by the loving teachers and the nurturing environment.

That same fun, passion and excitement has continued for the next 40 months. As he prepares to graduate from K2, as parents we feel extremely fortunate and thankful to Lumiere for providing him with a happy environment, fun learning, pleasant manners and important great friends for life

There are many views and models for Early childhood learning. We think that Lumiere has struck the right balance between activity-based learning, contextual learning and life-skill development. It is easy in Singapore for people to be overly focused on preparation towards p1, but then that becomes the destination without enjoying the journey.

Lumiere’s teaching models, self-sufficiency emphasis and pedagogical processes enable the journey to be so positive that kids have high levels of aptitude, good attitude and are full of receptivity

We’d encourage anyone out there looking to explore holistic early childhood preschools for their kids to consider Lumiere. Very happy to chat and share our experience as well. Our child and us would continue to stay in close touch with the wonderful school.",2019-11-13T14:05:09.535Z,education
Lumiere Montessori House @ Serangoon,5,"My twins have been attending Lumiere for the past 3 years (2017 to 2019) and they will be going on to P1 next year. We are very sad indeed to be leaving Lumiere as the teachers have provided allot of support and help as both of my boys are on the spectrum ( albeit Mild). The teaching is very well rounded so not only do they do the usual academic but they also emphasize on character building lessons and activities.
There is the annual charity drive whereby kids learn empathy and to give back to the community.
The school takes in kids who are on the spectrum ( to a certain degree) and the teachers have the supreme patience and are able to handle and teach my kids some self regulation and self awareness. Their 1 to 1 lessons in the afternoon helped initially with the behavior and subsequently it was to strengthen their academic background.

Thank you to all the teachers, Ernie, Serene, Aileen, Anisa, Sarah and lao shi ( chinese teacher) for all the patience and love shown to the boys. Aidan wants to stay in Lumiere FOREVER ( that's what he said).

From the moment i stepped into school, for the campus tour, i loved the environment! It was as though my heart found peace with a school that i can send my son to.

Just as a new mom, i was worried about sending Asher to a school for the first time. However, the teachers in Lumiere are unbelievable :) The way they showered him with love and care, i had no doubt that he was in good and safe hands!

We are always greeted with open hands and lovely smiles every morning and the teachers are always willing to have a chat with me when i need it.

Ms Serene, the school's principal, is awesome! She is so willing to hand hold a kid, not just during the start of school, but throughout the whole year. I'm so so impressed that she thinks for every student, notes down what she can do to help them grow.

This preschool is much more than a preschool, it's a family! The teachers are like moms to the kids! The school is full of infinite joy and laughter!

When all is said and done, the school is great and as the saying goes “Never judge a book by its cover”, we covered a topic of the school’s bad reviews the other day and a classmate of mine had told me that people tend to look on the negative sides of the story rather than the positive ones, and trust me, at least eighty percent of the reviews are reporting on the same case",2025-04-23T15:46:46.015Z,education

East Spring Secondary School,1,"Went to this school, clerks were LEGIT RUDE  especially the difficult plump angry bossy bespectacled Malay lady with tudong. The Malay lady always picked on me when I did wrong or even times when I was polite and did no wrong, and once insinuated that I lacked manners (Which was not true at all as I was passive and well-liked by all staff and have never offended any staff before) when she’s the one who ignored me and my mom to chit chat and tend to others after giving us the consent form and even after we have done signing and filling up when my mom came to fetch me as I was ill at the same time my mom was rushing me as she had to go toilet since we have been standing and waiting for 4 minutes just for her acknowledgment after we were done, so I had to help my mom to end it quick and leave, I prompted her “Hi, excuse me” only to be ignored first while she cut short her conversation with the others before turning to tell me in a long whining tone “What is it? Done already? That’s all. Next time wait, don’t interrupt. Have some manners” in front of my mom. Hello! How about you be considerate, responsible and reasonable? My mom has an urgency and I was already ill and all you needed to do was to collect the form and dismiss us while chatting, or better you wait for our form first before you chit chat with someone else! And there was once I had to hand in another form from 9am to 5pm, but since I was busy in the morning, I went at 3pm, only to be scolded by her for being so late when I was within the time limit and not even late or last minute. So I don’t appreciate such treatment. There have been so many bad rowdy unkind students, how about lecturing them? When I kept quiet, also got lectured. Everything also cannot? As a sickly person I dreaded having to go to the general office to be treated like that before getting fetched home. Well done now, I’m hurt by this on top of all the bullying by my schoolmates because of me being a shy passive teachers’ pet unlike the average teenagers. I hope you get fired from this field, or get back the same treatment by someone. One of my biggest regret in life was to enrol in East Spring Secondary School just because my parents made me as it’s right next to my house and like I said I was passive and agreeable with no opinions myself.

I have graduated from here back in 2014. But I think I had enough to say something about this school. I recently came to realization that my current classmate also graduated from this school as well and she withstand the same bs experience here as well (She graduated around 2021.)

At first, I thought it was just me who had a negative experience. But it's not just me.

I endured years and years of hardships in this school. It seriously took a toll on my mental health. Almost anybody who goes in sane and normal also become abnormal. Been bullied... Nobody helped. Been sexually harrased by other classmates, still nobody helped. Teachers also don't give a shit. They cared more about grades than your well-being, with a bit of favourtism at play. The functional daily structure and system in this school was crappy and cheapskate. Everyday, the mantra was about resilience, as part of their school values. Like hello?!?! NOT EVERYTHING NEED TO BE RESILIENT, OKAY? There's this thing called human rights and being treated like a normal human being. Only when I graduated and moved on to poly, then I was referred for counseling.

At first, I thought I must be the only one feeling this way about this school. Turns out it's not just me. Last week, I found out my friend also graduated from here and her experience was hell too.

NannySOS Confinement Nanny Agency,5,"Aunty Agnes has been providing valuable support in caring for our baby since her arrival. She is meticulous and keeps a watchful eye on the safety of our baby. She is also very experienced and generous with sharing tips about caring for newborns. As we are first-time parents and knew little about handling babies, Aunty Agnes was patient and comprehensive in teaching us how to look after our baby. We learned a lot from her - from bathing, carrying baby in different arm holds to feeding.

She also takes the initiative to make our lives easier - for example, she vacuums our home, places a disposable bag in the toilet for mum to put her used sanitary pads in, records the date of opening the formula milk tin as we don't keep the powder for more than 2 weeks, packs the bag for our polyclinic visits without being reminded to do so, mops the kitchen floor after every cooking. We enjoy the meals that she cooks as well.

Thank you, Aunty Agnes, for making our confinement experience a pleasant one! We are thankful for your help!",2025-08-03T11:06:47.423Z,education
NannySOS Confinement Nanny Agency,5,"Auntie Lilian was such a great help with our first child, she took care of him like her own. Thoughtful and observant, she anticipated my needs and made sure I always had bottles and pump parts washed and ready ahead of my schedule.

Even though we ordered confinement food for lunch and dinner, she was more than happy to cook extra dishes to make sure my husband and I have enough to eat. She also made sure I ate well for breakfast and would cook oatmeal porridge and make a very good ginger milk drink!",2025-08-01T09:30:50.384Z,education
NannySOS Confinement Nanny Agency,5,"We contacted a few different agencies and Juztin from NannySOS was the most efficient with his response. Communication with him was also very easy via email and WhatsApp. We got the package that includes the herbal tonic from Heng Foh Tong medical hall. They gave a generous amount of herbal soup and red date tea which are personalized to mummy (they sent a questionnaire beforehand to find out more about mummy's condition), as well as herbal bath packets. They also gave a complimentary slow cooker pot which was very well used for the whole confinement period. All in all, it was a very fuss-free experience with NannySOS.

Nanny Ah Yiew was a joy to have! She is highly professional and very experienced. The one thing we really love about her is that no matter how fussy the baby is or how tired she is, she's always smiling and positive. If she was ever frustrated or upset, she never showed it. By watching her, it also taught us how to be patient and not frustrated when the baby is crying and screaming. She also picked up the baby's patterns quickly and shared with us possible reasons why baby is upset eg. tired, gassy, hot so that we can quickly and effectively calm the baby.

She was also very knowledgeable in taking care of mummy. Once she knew our food preferences, we had great food every day, three times a day. Sometimes also with dessert. She advised what mummy can eat week by week, and also because our baby had jaundice there were certain foods mummy had to avoid. She kept the kitchen clean and neat, even better condition than it was before she came, haha. She also helped with cleaning around the house and laundry.

If we have a second baby we will definitely look for Ah Yiew again. Thank you NannySOS and Ah Yiew!",2025-07-31T04:55:26.996Z,education

She took such wonderful care of both me and my baby – I was able to rest well and eat so nutritiously under her care.

Aunty Candy is an amazing cook. She prepared different dishes for every meal, every single day, throughout the seven weeks she was with us. Each meal was a delight, and I looked forward to them every day.

Thanks to her, my baby is thriving and growing so well. She helped him get into a good routine with a consistent daily schedule, and he is now sleeping longer stretches through the night.

Most importantly, you can truly feel the passion and love she has for her work. She holds herself to such high standards, and beyond that, she brings so much joy and positive energy into the home. My family and I have really enjoyed having her around, and we are so sad that she will be leaving soon.

NannySOS Confinement Nanny Agency,5,"This is our 2nd time engaging Confinement Nannysos , and we are grateful to have Auntie Lilian as our confinement nanny!:)

Having Auntie Lilian is like having your own auntie at your home who cooks delicious dishes and red date tea with extra herbs to help nurse you back to health🥹 i barely drank my red date tea during my 2st confinement, but drank much more this time! Auntie is also very sincere, very real, that she allowed me to drink warm water, though she emphasized that the red date tea is still the preferred drink. Auntie also made her own brown rice ginger tea for me! As a tea lover, i absolutely love drinking this even though i only get to drink this as a late evening drink 😄 (though the best drink is still the red date tea)

Auntie Lilian treats my fam as her own; like steaming food for my 1st kid who has been coughing very badly; and its very warming to see. Auntie Lilian also shared her recipies with us, which i love her red bean pulut hitam dessert and brown rice and ginger tea and ginger milk drink🤤🤤

Auntie is also constantly learning and trying out new recipies and i am a happy food guinea pig😂 Auntie also showed me that i need not include any alcohol in my confinement diet to help me with my recovery, and i am happy because i do not drink (alcoholic drinks). I really enjoyed Auntie's cooking!

Auntie is really experienced, and i like that Auntie is constantly learning! Auntie told me about cold compression when i only heard of hot ones, and even reassured me on things i never experienced with my 1st born. I am happy as whatever auntie told me about my bb, was confirmed by the LC/PD.

Auntie also encourages latching and shares her knowledge willingly with us.

I like that auntie treats my boy like her own grandson :) So definitely thankful for auntie's help in taking care of both myself and my boy☺️❤️ even the massage massuese, from a totally unrelated company, commented that auntie Lilian is very good cos my bb seldom cried when she is here to do my massages! Auntie really loves kids 😊

Thanks Juztin for sending Auntie Lilian to us 🙏 and very glad to have extended Auntie's tenure with us and was thus able to enjoy more of Auntie's cooking and help in taking care of my boy and us😄 thank you Auntie Lilian for taking care of us❤️",2025-05-02T05:07:37.045Z,education

She also gets along well with all my family members as well as my first child, who enjoys her cooking. Even though baby disrupted her rest hours and nighttime, Aunty Janet has never once show any frustration and still be in her chirpy and energised self.

NannySOS Confinement Nanny Agency,5,"We came across NannySOS online and decided on them as their comms seemed more sincere and less commercialized than other bigger agencies. The confirmation process was super smooth and Juztin was always responsive to our enquiries.

We are thankful to have been allocated Aunty Agnes as our nanny - as first time parents, she has been nothing but affirming, encouraging and meticulous. Re caring for baby, Aunt Agnes is careful and on the ball - she supported us in tracking baby's feeds, provided advice and encouragement to normalise and acknowledge our worries, and is responsive to baby's numerous cues. She was also there for every dr's visit and somehow keeps up a much-needed aura of positivity even when we are all tired. It is also clear that Aunt Agnes loves children - it was reassuring to see her carrying and talking to baby when baby is fussing, and baby clearly calms down with her presence.

Aunt Agnes also took great care of us parents and the household. She prioritises our dietary preferences without compromising on confinement needs, and is super organised with a daily schedule of mealtimes and confinement bath preps. She is also clean and organised in both the prep works and cleaning up. As an experienced nanny with families in Singapore, we were also surprised and thankful that Aunty Agnes is knowledgeable about commonly bought + effective medications, baby items and where to get certain groceries locally. This provided us with a much needed peace of mind and support in this challenging period. When we started learning and taking on more of baby's routines under Aunty Agnes' guidance and supervision in the last 2 weeks, she is also encouraging and supportive and would suggest different methods for us to try out to see which works best for us.

Overall, we had a great period of rest and recovery with Aunty Agnes' care and presence. She does not impose traditional confinement practices (e.g. no hair washing), prioritises our needs and comfort, and takes meticulous care of baby and the household. She has been a wonderful source of support through the sleepless nights and dr's visits, and we feel more confident now to manage baby's care :) Thank you Aunty Agnes and NannySOS!",2025-03-26T03:53:44.752Z,education

NannySOS Confinement Nanny Agency,5,"This is our second time engaging Nanny SOS for their confinement services. We had a different nanny (Lilian) assigned to us this time, but the service was just as great as our experience the very first time. Both nannies that were assigned to us have over a decade of experience and a wealth of experience, giving us the much needed ease of mind.

Lilian was patient, and took a lot of initiative in tasks. She carefully observed what I needed and prepared them ahead of time. For instance, I have a habit of expressing milk from one breast while feeding the newborn on the other. She’ll ensure that the Hakka is ready whenever she brings my baby into the room for feedings. She also checks in regularly on my intake of red date tea and replenishes it timely.

She’s also flexible, on days that I am unable to cook for my older son she offers to cook a separate portion with less ginger so it’s toddler-friendly.

In the hours spent with her over conversation during meal times, I find her to be a sincere nanny who truly enjoys taking care of little ones.

Nanny Ah You checked in on my wife from time to time since she became pregnant with our second child earlier this year.

She once again took good care of my wife, enabling good healing and sufficient rest.

She insisted on preparing the herbal bath for my wife even though my wife wanted to skip it due to the cumbersomeness given our limited bathroom space.
She was especially helpful this time also in training our fresh Burmese helper, coaching her in newborn care and also teaching her many Chinese recipes.
Nanny Ah You is genuinely passionate about children - she is gentle and meticulous with caring for our second newborn, and also interacts lovingly with our toddler.

As she is so reliable - we were comfortable leaving her with our newborn to steal some quick couple dates in our second month.

After I recovered, she imparted her skills of how to take care of baby to me. This was a huge relief.

Under her care, I was able to recover very quickly. She empathised with my low morale because of pain after birth- she was not overly strict, taking over the night duty and encouraging me to get more rest.

Most notably, she has a strong passion for cooking, whipping up absolutely delicious and nourishing meals for my family. She even shared her recipes with my family members when they asked! She brought alot of cheerfulness to my household and we will miss her very much.

The Little House (Montessori),5,The best kindergarten in Singapore 🥰,2025-08-13T04:00:55.946Z,education
The Little House (Montessori),5,"TLH is truly a preschool with a difference. We were sad when our son's previous school closed and we had to find a new school for K1. However, it turned out a blessing in disguise because we found TLH. Despite visiting 12 other well-reputed preschools, I'm so glad we chose TLH.

Mrs Katherine, TLH's founder and principal, has a strong vision for the school and how it runs. She is also the most on-the-ground principal I've seen! From being at the gate every morning to welcome the kids, to teaching them, and engaging parents at dismissal/coffee mornings I'm assured her high standards are kept. One thing that struck me when I first walked into the school was how the kids were calm, happy and engaged. I see the philosophy of the school in every aspect of how it is run. Even when I've faced challenging behaviours with my kids, Mrs Katherine has given me advice from her extensive experience and tried-and-tested philosophy.

Mrs Katherine and her teachers also make the effort to know each child individually. During parent teacher meets (and throughout the school year in fact), they share insights that would only come from spending enough time with my child and interacting with him meaningfully.

Many schools claim to develop the child holistically. TLH truly does this and in unique yet effective ways.

My son's previous preschool never brought up his gross motor skills as a concern. At the first parent teacher meet with TLH, they told me it needed working on. I was initially in doubt as I saw him to be adept in the area, especially as we invested time in outdoor play every day after school. However, besides daily outdoor play, TLH also has the most creative races/obstacle courses that train different muscles. A year later, my boy started martial arts outside of school and surprised me and the coaches with his agility. When I asked him why he was so good at the exercises, he said it's like what they do at TLH!

They have weekly cooking sessions where the kids are given the chance to do everything themselves, even when cutting, grating and stir-frying! Since then, my son started having an interest when I bake at home and independently helps me out.

My son was exposed to science experiments in TLH too. On multiple occasions, he was able to explain how something worked when even my older P2 daughter couldn't. Again, he would cite TLH as his source of knowledge 😄

I find some preschools charge exorbitantly, and I really don't like how that is amplified during the usual year-end concerts. For TLH, I've always felt their pricing was reasonable, whether in term fees or add-ons. They do not charge extra for their year-end concerts, but instead make it a team effort, where the kids and teachers create the props, costumes and backdrops themselves. That said, if you are the sort of parent who likes perfectly polished concerts likened to watching The Sound of Music on Broadway, this may not be for you. Instead, we look forward every year to performances that allow kids to be kids, and are planned, practiced and performed with much ownership from the kids themselves.

One common misconception about montessori schools is whether kids would be able to transit to mainstream primary. My son who is naturally not the most studious, has had an easy transition into Primary school. In K1, he used to not be able to concentrate on work for longer than 10 minutes. He is now able to concentrate and finish 4-5 pages of homework, and still go on to study for tingxie. He is able to follow the structure of formal schooling yet have the confidence to answer questions when he wants to.

Just in case this is all sounding too good to be true - we as parents get no benefit out of writing good reviews for the school. It is testament to how much we love TLH. Mrs Katherine and her team have been a God-send for our family! Thank you, TLH!",2025-02-13T08:12:44.521Z,education

She supervises students and teachers in the school every day. She knows the operation of the school very well and is very strict about everything, which is also part of why I like this kindergarten. She is very experienced. When you don't know how to help your child, just approach her and she will be happy to guide you. Her teaching methods are very effective.

I also experienced first-hand, her quick diagnosis and suggestions whenever we sought her advice throughout my kid’s journey in TLH. Even though I’m not a first time parent, I must say I learnt a lot from Ms Katherine and her strong team. Very impressed with the low turnover rate of the teachers and the love and dedication that the teachers showered on the kids. Out of all my kids, the one who attends TLH is most willing to try to speak Mandarin at home, thanks to the school’s way of learning.
There is a lot of emphasis on parents and school mutual support which I believe is necessary in educating a child. My kid is already saying that she wants to go back to her school as and when she can when she’s in primary school next year as she misses her teachers and friends!

The Little House (Montessori),5,"TLH is an outstanding preschool! I highly recommend it.
The principal (Mrs. Katherine) is also the founder and owner of the school. This means that she has final say of how to run the school and sees ideas thru to implementation. It is extremely valuable to have consistent leadership. She anchors and ensures that the school is run up to her high standards and principles, and based on sound research of what is best for children.
The children are taught to be socially aware, responsible and considerate. These and other good habits are inculcated from day one resulting in the school having a calm and cheerful atmosphere. It’s like a home away from home. The school motto is “help me help myself”. There is a focus on confidence and initiative in the context of community. Mrs. Katherine is the model of a skilled and confident person. What better way to teach confidence than to exemplify it authentically! The teachers she selects are of high quality and quite a few have been at the school for many years. This means it’s a stable environment for the children. My child often tells me how much he loves interacting with his teachers. It is a language-rich environment and I have never heard the teachers speak bad English or Mandarin.
This is a mixed age Montessori school. Older children are paired with younger ones and the kids learn social graces within community, not simply in theory. Older ones learn patience, leadership and kindness towards younger ones. Younger ones experience this and have confidence that one day they can in turn be in that role, rather than all children waiting on adults to serve them. All kids learn that they are active, useful and integral parts of their community thru everyday interactions.
When I went for the school tour a few years ago, I was really caught off guard by 4 children coming up to me to see if I wanted a drink. They were going to pour water for me and host me! It is a true testimony as to how TLH respects children as individuals, believes in their abilities, and empowers them, to the point that the children were not unduly afraid of me, and saw it as their responsibility to host me, the guest in their school. I had visited 10 schools before deciding on this one and even my 1st runner up school is a far cry from what happened during my tour here. The other schools basically told the children to not disturb the adult talking with the principal and go do their own thing. Whereas at TLH, while no one interrupted the conversation, the children were instead encouraged to step up. They are not treated like a distraction to the “real work” that only adults do, but they are empowered to play key roles in the “real work”. Imagine the feeling of accomplishment and personal value they feel, and how eager they would be to step up and take initiative again! It shows me how the teachers view the children and their abilities, and natural opportunities that can be seized to build the kids up. To me, these are very well trained and intelligent teachers, and I would be safe to partner with them for my child’s learning journey.
There is an individualised learning plan for each child. Academic lessons like math and reading are done 1-1. The fast learner does not have to sit in a bored classroom learning what he already knows. The slower learner does not have to feel shame and be discouraged to try their best. The kids abilities are intimately known by teachers because of this 1-1 interaction.
There is cooking every week where the children themselves get to cook! One of life's greatest sensorial  experience. And they learn counting, fractions, mass and volume, chemical reactions, new vocabulary and all that academic stuff without even realizing it.
Montessori schools are meant to be so much more than just Maria Montessori's materials. It is the entire ethos and community life, seeing thru children’s eyes and respecting them as valuable individuals. TLH is a Montessori par excellence.",2023-04-01T16:12:23.323Z,education

The Little House (Montessori),5,"This was the first kindergarten I viewed after we moved to sunset area. I stepped in an old fashion glass door and got a warm welcome from Mrs Katherine. She enthusiastically walked me around while introducing how the classes would be carried out etc. We walked to the outdoor area, kids were happily playing in the small garden. There came a little girl, she saw me and came close to me. Before I realised, she poured me a glass of water from their snack station, where I saw a tray with couple of glasses stacking up, a jar of water and bananas neatly laying on top of it. That was it. I cancelled all appointments with other kindergarten and enrolled my boy.

My boy was then 4yr8month, he enjoyed going to TLH so much. Every week he told me a new science experiment; a new country with either its language or food; a new role-play with manner; oh yeah, a new goodie he made under the instruction of teachers. I was very impressed. The teachers made it all seemed so effortless, yet meaningful.

I remembered those days, parents gathered outside of the glass door where the kids lined up and got checked before going in school. Teachers welcomed kids with the brightest smile and funny talks. Mrs Katherine stood at her most comfy tree pose and chatted with us, we all started our days with lots of joy and laughter. Of course, most importantly, we knew our kids would have a wonderful school day at TLH.

How can I not mention the year end concert? It was fascinating. Nothing fancy but full of love and warmth. Teachers and kids designed their own stage, no one needed to wear special clothes or make-up. Kids chose what they most comfortable with and what they want to perform. They gave it their best on the stage. It was a pure joy for parents to see the how much their confidence have grown over a year. 2020, the pandemic hit. Teachers in TLH managed to gather all students single performing clips and created a long video. It was heartfelt. Still it seemed so effortless but meaningful.

We strongly recommend The Little House Montessori. It was the best decision to enrol our boy there. Everyday in his primary school life has benefitted greatly from his experience at TLH. Thank you all the lovely teachers in TLH.",2021-06-14T04:29:34.324Z,education

Even though she has been in the industry for 20 years, and can hire more teachers so that she can be more hands off, she still opted for a hands on approach to teaching and interact with the kids as if they are her own by choosing to teach herself.

In her lessons, I can tell that she genuinely cares about the students' well being that goes beyond dollar and sense. The students love interacting with her and looks forward to her lessons as she takes the effort to build strong relationship with the students.

For weaker students, she also takes the time and effort to encourage them, while spurring the classmates to do the same also.

Every year, no matter how busy she gets, she makes the effort to know the incoming orientation class as well, so that she knows everyone by name. We are privileged and thankful to have worked with someone like Susan over her tuition centre journey.",2022-09-03T05:09:08.999Z,education

At our request, she keeps a log of activities for the day so that we are not left out of the loop.

Additionally, because there aren't so many kids around, the environment is kept clean and baby has had good health since being put in the childminding program. This is a huge burden off our shoulders.

Every evening, he shares about what he learns - going beyond the academics but also things around the world. Special shout out to his teachers Wu Lao Shi and Ms Adrea who is so patient with him when it comes to learning Chinese and music 🎶

Special shout out to his form teacher Ms Franny. She pours her heart into the job and I see her on weekend birthday parties and kids’ play dates. It is no surprise that she was loved and moved at the K2 graduation earlier… it’s almost like her graduation too as a 2nd mummy to the class. Don't be deceived by her coloured streaks and her tattoo - she’s puts her ALL in the role as an educator, disciplinarian, and most importantly friend. The kids know it too - my boy called her “his best friend” until the other boys bribed him away with Pokémon cards.

Agora Colearning,5,"I have done the rounds of pre schools in Singapore over the past 7 years. I have looked for a preschool that actively cares and listens to the child, never leaves a crying child assuming they’ll ’just be ok’ and a preschool where smiling teachers wholeheartedly nurture the children. Agora is the place! From the first day to the last, the team do everything they can to help the child settle, feel comfortable, develop relationships with all staff as well as other children and their parents. A special mention to Ms Eka, Ms Bell and Ms Pari who have done everything they can for my son - and for me too! Their warmth, consistency, effort, sense of humour and care has been the best model my son could have seen a pre school to be. Sometimes evidence of this is hard to prove in preschools, but I have seen first hand over a year how effective the whole team are at making children feel welcomed, safe and essentially HAPPY. I have learned so much myself from them even though I used to teach myself - it really is colearning! There really isn’t anything like Agora in Singapore - it suits everyone from locals to expats and everyone is treated exactly how they should be - it’s a beautiful hearty place to start your education journey with your child and I can’t recommend enough. Thank you Agora and to the special teachers - you have made me look at my son differently, made me slow down my parenting and given my son space to be whoever he wants to be. He’s only had positive experiences at the centre and that alone is amazing. Even the children are all wonderful - I’ve seen so many progress right in front of me and it’s purely because of the teachers. And to Ms Claire who runs the centre - you are as I’ve told you, an ANGEL! You shine bright and take everyone with you - how magical.

Agora Colearning,5,"A Day at the Beach
This morning, the teachers and management team at Agora brought all the Play Group students to the beach. Despite the very young age of the children—some as young as 18 months—the teachers took wonderful care of them throughout the outing.
Their dedication, commitment, and tender love were clearly shown. The children had a great time by the sea, playing with sand and enjoying the fresh air. Although it rained earlier, the children stayed dry thanks to the team’s thoughtful planning and alternative arrangements.
It was heartwarming to see the children and teachers so happy, though a little tired by the end. These outings always create special bonding moments between teachers, parents, and children.
Though not the first time Agora has organised such a trip, it was once again a successful and memorable experience.

Thank you, Agora team!",2025-06-06T06:52:55.538Z,education

Agora Colearning,5,"Aisyah and team are impeccable. We recently celebrated our son’s 1st birthday at Agora Co-Learning Space and honestly, we couldn't have asked for a better experience. From the very first message to the last moment of packing up, Aisyah went above and beyond for us.

The attention to detail was insane — every corner of the venue was thoughtfully arranged, the setup was beautiful, and the whole flow of the event was seamless. She helped us coordinate with vendors, gave honest recommendations, and even secured better deals for us. What really blew us away was how she handled things after the event too — one of the vendors arrived late (not her fault at all), and yet she still gave us a discount just to make sure we were happy. That kind of care is so rare.

Aisyah was also incredibly accommodating throughout the planning process. We had a lot of specific requests — from kid-friendly setups to ensuring the space worked for elderly guests — and she just handled everything like a pro. She even gave us a really fair and affordable package without compromising on quality.

And here’s the kicker: she’s pregnant and still stayed till the very end to help us pack up. We tried to stop her but she just smiled and insisted. Truly someone who puts her heart into what she does.

Thank you Aisyah and the Agora team for making our little boy’s first birthday so special. You really made our dream event come true. Highly, highly recommended — and seriously to the bosses, give this woman a raise!",2025-04-30T01:29:00.396Z,education

Agora Colearning,5,"As a parent of a neurodivergent child, finding the right preschool felt like an uphill battle. My son, who has sensory and learning challenges, struggled to adapt in previous schools that simply weren’t equipped to support his unique needs. After multiple attempts, we finally found Agora, and it has been nothing short of transformative.

From day one, his teachers have provided not just instruction but deep, intentional care. They have taken the time to truly understand his emotional and learning needs, tailoring their approach to ensure he feels safe, valued, and capable. Their patience, creativity, and commitment have helped him make progress we once thought impossible. He is now more engaged, more confident, and most importantly, happy to go to school each day.

At the heart of Agora’s philosophy is its incredible head of Early Years director, Miss Claire. She doesn’t just manage the program—she listens. She understands that every child is different and ensures that each one is nurtured in a way that respects their individual journey. Her leadership fosters an environment where children are not just accommodated but genuinely celebrated for who they are.

Agora is more than a preschool; it is a community that embraces diversity with warmth and sincerity. If you are a parent searching for a place where your child will be seen, heard, and supported, I cannot recommend Agora enough. I encourage you to visit, meet the wonderful educators, and see firsthand the love and dedication that make this school so special.",2025-02-07T13:03:47.271Z,education

Agora Colearning,5,"I recently booked the event spaces at Agora Colearning for my daughter's 2nd birthday. It was a great experience overall from start to end.

1. The events manager Aishah was very prompt and helpful from the moment I reached out to her. She was able to answer my questions and provided advice/suggestions to make the event a more meaningful one for my daughter and guests. It made the whole planning for the event a fuss-free and pleasant experience.

2. The playspace that I rented was very spacious and clean. It came with 3 playing areas for the kids - mini playground, baby gym and kitchen play area. These areas kept all the kids entertained for the duration of the party.

3. There was still plenty of space left for tables and chairs to be set up for guests to sit and dine. Overall, the whole area wasn't cramped and was good for our party size of 30+ guests (both kids and adults).

4. One advantage of working with Agora was their tie ups with their vendors. I did not have to go through the trouble of finding my own vendors. Through the recommendation of Aishah, I engaged a balloon sculptor, bouncy castle and a face painter. Both vendors were not only prompt to come early but were excellent in their services. The kids had so much fun face painting and getting animal balloons.

5. Accessibility was easy even though it was located at Harbourfront Centre. Plenty of parking spaces within the building.

All in all, I would highly recommend working with Agora and renting their spaces for kid's birthday parties.

Would love to show photos of the venues but all the photos have images of my child and the kids of the guests. Apologies due to privacy issues.",2024-08-07T00:51:52.866Z,education

We would like to extend a special thanks to our N2C teachers: teacher Candice and Chen Laoshi for their genuine love and care for the kids, and thoughtful encouragement on how to help the children on becoming strong students as well as great people with good values/manners.  Our son is always happy to go to school, learns so much from the teachers, and will share what he picks up from school with us back at home each day.

The recent SG60 National Day celebration and performance was a great example of how much time and effort the teachers put into their preparation.

Students don't really get what they signed up for. Classes are combined often because of business or cost cutting measures. Management is deceitful; workers owed many months' pay.

Over time, we've seen remarkable improvements in her English and Chinese language skills, and she has developed so many positive habits that we hadn't even taught her at home. From practicing good hygiene to learning how to change her diaper, take on and off her clothes, and put back items where she takes them, to even using her hands to block her mouth when coughing—these are life skills that go beyond the classroom and show the care and thoughtfulness of the teachers.

Our daughter is genuinely excited to go to school every day, and it's heartwarming to see her so happy. The environment here is truly child-friendly, with a spacious, well-maintained outdoor playground that she absolutely loves. In fact, it's her favorite spot to play when we pick her up after school. She also talks about how delicious the food is, and we couldn’t agree more—it smells amazing every time we pass by the kitchen during drop-offs.

The teachers go above and beyond by taking photos to update us on her activities, giving us a better understanding of her school life and allowing us to feel more connected to her development.

Lorna Whiston Preschool (Hort Park),5,"My 3yo daughter was enrolled into LW before they moved to current Hort Park location, so I was lucky to experience the school in both environments. I remember back in the black and white house, every time I passed by the school playground around 5pm, I saw not only the kids having fun, but all teachers there with the kids, running, chasing each other, laughing, and very engaged. I could see the teachers truly enjoyed being with the kids and love what they do.

My daughter was shy and resistant of going to school before LW. We thought it was just her personality. However since she got into LW, she's been super excited to go to school every day, and whenever I asked her, she would say she ""Love the school and the teachers"".

The school also has a lot more fun filled classes throughout the day, a lot more than usual preschools. They have dedicated teachers for each of sports, music, art, speech and drama subjects, and dedicated space for each subject. My daughter always had so much fun in school that I didn't mind keeping her there for the full day till 5:30pm. She probably wouldn't have had equal amount of fun and engaging activities in a social setting if she comes home earlier.

Still, on top of all the amazing resources and hardware, what's important to us as parents, in the end, is the team working in the school. Despite the fact that they lost their own outdoor space, the teachers mostly remained the same, and most teachers have been there for many years. Tbe fact that they cared so much about the kids and loved their work, made me decide to stay with the school after the move.

I believe hardware is easy to get. But consistently loving teachers as a team, that the kids are looking forward to seeing everyday, is hard to get by. I would strongly recommend this school to anyone who cares about the above factors as much as we do.",2025-03-29T15:38:51.226Z,education

Given LW’s background they are naturally strong in English but I feel that their Chinese curriculum is truly amazing and most of their Chinese Teachers (Native Chinese) are fairly long tenured & experienced. My 9 year old boy started at LW PG at 1.5 yrs, and most of the Chinese teachers then are still around. My 6 year K2 girl is graduating this year and she is able to read many Chinese books by herself which I was personally quite impressed by. She was even able to read most of the common words 米小圈 which completely surprised me. We have not sent our kids to any Chinese enrichment programmes while they were at LW and my boy has been able to cope well after in Primary school. I really attribute that to the strong bilingual environment and strong academic foundation that LW has given my children.

Books are readily available in the classrooms and there are reading programmes. Children also get to bring home 2-4 books every week to read. LW has also done a great job inculcating a love of reading in my children.

Aside from academics, I think their biggest strength is that they have a good balance between play and learning. The children also have a lot of time to play and express their creativity.

Posso Preschool @ Jurong East,5,"Absolutely recommend Posso JE Infant Care! From the first school tour where we were introduced to Chen Laoshi, the in-charge for infant care, we were met with kindness, professionalism, and a genuine sense of care for the infants. The infants there looked so happy and it was so cute that they were welcoming to visitors too!

My boy was there since he was about 5 months old and everyday he is excited to attend school and we can really tell that he learnt a lot of social and developmental skills in school! Chen Laoshi leads a team of 4 other teachers who are all knowledgeable, attentive, and patient with our boy. It is clear they truly have a deep passion for working with infants, especially Chen Laoshi.

The teacher to infant ratio is about 1:2 or 3 at currently, the environment is warm, clean and comfortable for the infants, and there is even an indoor swimming/jacuzzi pool for the infants to enjoy! Whether it's feeding, sleep routines, or playtime, every detail is taken into consideration, and we can see the positive impact it’s having on our boy’s growth and happiness.

Communication is excellent too whether it’s daily updates, or quick responses to any questions we have, we always feel well-informed and reassured, especially by Chen Laoshi who really goes out of her way for the well-being of the infants.

Our boy has sensitive skin and is prone to eczema acting up, and the teachers have all put in extra effort and care to applying the creams for our boy diligently and making sure his skin is well maintained and clean.

Overall, we are truly grateful for the teachers' exceptional dedication. Our boy has promoted to Playgroup now and still misses Chen Laoshi, the teachers and friends over at Infant care! :D",2024-11-13T03:45:42.142Z,education

Brighton Montessori HarbourFront,5,"Our son started at Brighton in September 2023 at 20 months in Pre-Nursery and he has really flourished from his experiences at Brighton! He was blessed with having caring teachers who nurtured him and took the time to know and care for him.
We also saw great changes come into place once Ms Fairuz stepped in as principal last year. I was thoroughly impressed that she listened to our concerns about nap times for N2 and made appropriate changes to the schedule accordingly.
There are great family days, they involve the parents with learning opportunities for the parents to come and spend time as the teacher with their children, as well as opportunities for parents to see what the kids do at school.
The teachers my son had, Ms Tiffany, Ms Ong and Ms Mandy, made learning fun for him and we can see how eager he is to learn which is so beautiful ❤️ thank you teachers for your time and devotion! We so appreciate you.
They also try and make the best out of the facilities they have and ensure the kids get enough outdoor play as much as they can.
Thank you team HFC Brighton Montessori!! We’re keen to see our younger son experience this too later this year!",2025-04-16T13:06:48.258Z,education
Brighton Montessori HarbourFront,5,"After the new principal arrived, there have been remarkable changes in the school. A wide variety of interesting activities have been added. Now, parents can be more deeply involved in their children's class affairs and personally experience their children's classes, directly understanding how they perform during class. Some parents even have the opportunity to come to the school and act as teachers to give a lesson to the children. All these measures are of great significance. In my opinion, if the class size can be better controlled, it is likely that children will have a better teaching experience, and the quality of teaching will be further improved.",2025-04-11T11:47:29.201Z,education

They create a nurturing and supportive environment where each child feels valued and understood. Our daughter has thrived under their care, growing in confidence and joy every day.

The campus location is great and safe (at the marina thus minimal traffic and super simple pick up/drop offs), superb natural light in the school (instead of those fluorescent lit dingy hole in the wall schools/classrooms), big outdoor play area, stunning views and extremely attentive staff.

Coming from MindChamps, I was honestly not expecting a huge change given that my son already liked school. But ever since we started at JG, he has been begging to get to school early for breakfast (he is not a morning person at all but wakes up without a fuss) and sometimes even requests to return to school after school ends.

He has become more outspoken, confident and happier overall. Biggest plus being that he is exhausted and knocks out early every night.

We have been through several schools but nothing compares to JG. Can’t wait for my younger son to join his brother there.

I really appreciate that my children are in good hands each day with teachers who love and care for them deeply and they effectively communicate through regular updates. From my conversations with my children, I understand that teaching does not happen only through a one-way instruction but through play and facilitated discussions to help the children question and discover truths for themselves.

"School of Science and Technology, Singapore",3,"This school gives visitors the feeling of a stifling shell—functional, but missing the heartbeat of a caring culture, shared identity, and sense of belonging. A soulful school feels like a home, not a well-equipped hotel: its walls, corridors and notice boards radiate kindness, creativity, and connection—through student art, heartfelt reminders, photos of CCAs, community projects and signs that reflect who they are and what they value. These visible cues matter deeply, especially during the teenage years, when holistic development depends not just on academics, but on feeling seen, safe, inspired, and encouraged to care for others. I was a bit surprised to see nothing of these which are commonly observed in many other schools in Singapore.",2025-08-16T08:10:33.436Z,education

Suggestions for new dsa test : check their responsibility. Send a teacher to their primary school and watch them. This allows the teacher to assess the student, and they will know if they're a suitable candidate.
Teachers also needs to take matters in their own hands if a student reports a student for not doing their pt. I do know we, as teenagers, are expected to be more responsible and settle it out on ourselves.

In his Senior thesis, he was allowed to choose a topic of interest, that is, increasing the social virality of his Youtube channel. In the course of this, he was able to develop his research and communications skills. Second, ICS has sufficient module offerings to allow my child to grow his giftings. For example, being part of the School Yearbook team, he was able to hone his photography and editing skills. As a result, he was able to intern, upon graduation, at a photo studio.

The entire staff see their work as more than a job and more of a calling - they are passionate educators who are truly shaping and encouraging our children to be little world changers. The caring community, intentionality in character building, and individual attention are beyond compare. We didn’t know how our family would adjust to SG, but largely due to ICS, we are loving it, feel connected, and hope to stay long term! ☺️",2023-04-25T08:13:33.709Z,education

Felt she was hardworking and caring though, and perhaps could make a good Mandarin teacher.  But, learnt later that inappropriate remarks were made to the children, that could terrify or scare them (about throwing them out, etc)..
Seriously inadequate carpark facilities, esp after merger with GreatWorld branch. Imagine total of more than 100 children, in a facility with only 8 outdoor lots (no shelter), out of which, 6 lots are located dangerously close to the canal, and laden with uneven or broken concrete slabs and stones all around (my child fell at a lot and got injured once).
Despite numerous reminders not to throw anything, they still lost some of my child's work and craft done at school (6 out of 8 items I tried to get, were lost, guess thrown away) :(
Overall, not worth the high fees, as even the government or government-related centres had teachers who spoke and taught better Eng, and who displayed more sincerity.  Here, no viable action was done to rectify the issue of the lack of Eng standards in a kindergarten level teacher who taught Eng and Math, and not a single word of apology was given to address the fact that changing school in the middle of the final yr of kindergarten posed so much hassle to us.",2020-06-09T06:37:39.650Z,education

To be honest at first I really disliked the lessons and couldn't understand much. But Mr Eio was helpful and helped me to understand the things that I couldn't understand. I must say that you have to take charge of your own learning and go up to him with questions. Don't wait silently without understanding anything, which is what I was like in the first half of my lessons with him. He was willing to stay back with me when I had questions and encouraged me alot

I was a F9 student throughout sec 3. Got D7 for my prelims. For my Olevels I got an A2. I must say Mr Eio is not some kind of a magician to help you instantly change your grades. You have to put in the hard work yourself. But he certainly was a very big help and helped me to achieve my results. His encouragement meant so much each night and it gave me the motivation and drive to make him and myself proud. He helped me understand the concepts better for every question I asked

100% recommend. I would have expected to get an A for my Amath. Was even considering dropping it. Mr Eio can be strict sometimes, but his lessons are engaging and fun. You will definitely enjoy it.

"Simon Eio Learning Centre - Primary, Secondary and JC Math & Science Tuition @ Clementi",5,"The centre as well as its teachers have accompanied me throughout my secondary school years. Their close guidance and teaching methods are one of the main reasons why I am able to understand and grasp concepts much quicker than my peers in school which facilitates a deeper understanding of the topic and subject as a whole. The teachers are very open and dedicated to helping my classmates and I whenever and wherever we may have had problems with our work, making the learning process much smoother and less frustrating than it would have been without them. It is thanks to them that I am confident in scoring well in my O levels.

Mr Eio has each lesson curated by him to provide the fastest path to understanding the topic in both E math and A math, distilling the learning points of the topic at hand through his years of experience teaching and allowing us to learn it deeply before tackling harder questions. It allows students like myself to have a good perspective on what the topic actually is without getting scared by the more difficult problems that the topic may have to offer, allowing me to score more marks during the exam as I am able to rely on the few important question processing steps that he has emphasised during lessons.

Mr Lim makes learning easier by giving many real life examples and applications of the sciences that we are learning in class, making information stick and making it easier for me to retrieve information during exams. He plans his lessons meticulously and has a plan for each stage of learning that we are in, whether it be in studying or revision. He goes the extra mile by sorting through years and years of past year papers from other schools and picking out the most interesting ones so that we are better equipped to answer whatever questions come out for the exams; which can be quite erratic as is the nature of the science exams, which is why his extensive combing is much appreciated

Bright Notes Pte Ltd,5,"Ms Sharon is an excellent piano teacher, probably the best I've had so far in my 15-year music journey. As a grade 8 student, she pushes me to master pieces to a high level of technicality and musicality. I often feel like I'm receiving conservatory-level lessons every week! She demonstrates the Grade 8 pieces for me with proper technique and allows me to record it so I can practice at home. With this, I’m able to overcome difficult passages at home. After class, we engage in musical exploration where we take a look at other pieces outside the syllabus, and she is more than happy to play them for me. Ms Sharon has the capacity to teach students of all ages, from toddlers to young adults like myself.

- Had lessons that overlap with other students' without compensation
- Tried to guilt-trip me into letting matters (such as lessons overlapping with other students' slide) by insisting that my lesson fees were reduced (She charged me $90 a lesson for diploma level, and I found a far more professional and sincere teacher charging less than that lmao)

Masterminds Montessori Kindergarten,5,"We cannot express enough gratitude for the incredible experience our three children have had at Masterminds Namly. This school has not only become their second home but has masterfully prepared them for their academic future in ways that continue to amaze us.

The academic foundation our children have built at Masterminds Namly is truly remarkable. The school's approach to preparing students for future educational success goes far beyond traditional kindergarten curriculum. Their bilingual program has given our children fluency in both English and Chinese, providing them with invaluable language skills that will open doors throughout their academic careers and beyond.

What sets this school apart is how seamlessly they blend rigorous academic preparation with the caring, loving environment that makes learning joyful. The teachers are not just dedicated educators—they are visionary professionals who understand how to build critical thinking skills, foster independence, and instill a genuine love of learning that will serve our children for life.

The multicultural environment enriches their academic experience immensely, exposing them to diverse perspectives and ways of thinking that broaden their intellectual horizons. Our children's confidence has grown exponentially, not just socially but academically—they approach new challenges with enthusiasm and the tools to succeed.

Masterminds brilliantly prepares children for future academic success by developing self-direction, problem-solving abilities, and intrinsic motivation. Our children have learned to think independently, manage their time effectively, and take ownership of their learning—skills that will be invaluable as they progress through their educational journey.

The thoughtfully designed quaterly field activities reinforce classroom learning while developing real-world application skills. These experiences teach our children to connect academic concepts to the world around them, fostering the kind of critical thinking that top schools look for.

Under the leadership of their incredibly principal, Carol, the school maintains academic excellence while nurturing the whole child. The curriculum is rigorous yet age-appropriate, challenging our children to reach their full potential while building the strong academic foundation they need for future success.

We owe this school and its remarkable teachers so much. They've given our children the academic tools, confidence, and love of learning that will carry them through elementary school, high school, and beyond. When we see how well-prepared and excited about learning our children are, we know Masterminds Namly has given them the greatest gift possible—a strong start for lifelong academic success.

To any parent seeking academic excellence combined with genuine care: Masterminds Namly delivers preparation for the future while making the present joyful. Our three children are not just ready for their next academic steps—they're thriving.",2025-08-13T05:19:50.464Z,education

Modern Montessori Bukit Batok - MMI,1,"Very belated review.. If I can rate them zero, i totally will. My child was transferred here from another MMI during Covid,unfortunately rhat few months was the worst time of my child's pre-school life and for us too.
Firstly, principal n teachers didn't follow Covid rules of masking up. When asked, they gave ALOT of excuse n were very defensive.
Principal was obviously showing bias towards my child when we complained and she gave a super bad attitude to us and the child. What kind of educator does that!? We spoke to a few parents and they were also not happy with them (for their own reasons) but they decided not to pursue since their child has just a few months to graduation. Same for us, but it was too hard to bear.

Not going through long story here but since there were some issues with the principal, we went down to talk to her. she  spoke to us from inside the center, through the window. After while, said the kids were sleeping so she stepped out to talk but started shouting soon after n then stormed back into the center n slammed the door on us and left us standing outside the school! Seriously?? The principal?? Why did she do that? Because she couldn't defend her own mistakes anymore n decided to hide away?

We even spoke to head office and when we thought head office is making some actions, all they said was, the principal had been with them for many years.
So what does that even mean?? They said will speak to her but nothing came back to ua. Honestly, we were so upset that we even contemplated to go to ECDA but decided not to in case it affects my child.
Despite us not not bringing this further, the principal & some teachers showed prejudice towards my child. It's obvious in many little ways.

And I finally decided to review them after so many years, is because my child only recently asked me why did she change to Bt Batok & said she hated the school. The principal n a teacher would look at her and frown at her for no reason. The teacher even asked my child why is she frowning at the teacher?
Again, seriously??? Why would a child frown at the adult, if maybe in the first place, the adult frowned at the child??

If the principal or teachers have an issue with the parents, or they are not happy with the parents making comments or complains about their double standards, then please speak to us. They SHOULD NOT do that to a child, AS AN EDUCATOR. In the first place, if they had done right and not done double standards, there wouldn't be any issues for anyone. They are not even handling rhe situation as a professional.

In short, that short few months of school change was a TOTAL MISTAKE and it has totally ruined a small child's preschool life. In fact, it has ruined ours and our view of MMI too.

If any parents like to know the story, I'm happy to speak to you.

We had the privilege of experiencing 2 principals and both have been super hands on, which is important to us as they walk the talk. In the morning and evening, principal Ms Ima is there to greet and send off the children. It is also easy to communicate with her and to review my child’s growth thanks to her presence at the center.

Teachers here are thoughtful and sincere in their care and teaching of the children. They have the child’s development at heart and this is hard to find as I believe most teachers are hit with a fatigue given the general shortage of teachers now.

For example, even during school trips, Ms Deborah goes above and beyond to prepare for any mishaps (e.g. preparing extra uniforms for the children), which I really appreciate after a child (mine) went wild to play in the rain.

I’m not sure about other methodologies but the Montessori method has greatly taught my son independence in his conduct at home and I’m super grateful for that. Can’t wait to send my daughter to MMI Bukit Batok when she turn 18 months old!",2024-01-25T13:44:18.686Z,education

Nurtured Nest,5,"Nurtured Nest holds a very special place in our hearts. My daughter spent nearly three years there, and those years laid a truly beautiful foundation for her—socially, emotionally, and intellectually. She made friends for life and experienced a nurturing environment that continues to shape her even after our move to Canada.

What impressed me most was how seamlessly the teachers at Nurtured Nest instilled a sense of discipline and individuality from such a young age. For young girls in particular, it’s so important to learn that their voices matter and their opinions are valued—and this was deeply embedded in the school's ethos. Remarkably, the confidence and curiosity my daughter developed at Nurtured Nest helped her transition smoothly to her new school, where she continues to thrive.

Beyond the children’s growth, the school embodies the multicultural spirit of Singapore. Every festival—whether Chinese New Year, Hari Raya, or Diwali—is celebrated with equal joy and inclusiveness. As parents, we were welcomed as part of a larger extended family, and I still fondly remember looking forward to each of these celebrations.

Choosing Nurtured Nest was one of the best decisions we made for our daughter. I would be more than happy to connect with any prospective parent who would like to hear more about our experience.",2025-06-30T17:00:10.947Z,education

Nurtured Nest,5,"Our two young boys attended Nurtured Nest from around 17–18 months old and spent several wonderful years there. We initially chose NN because of its focus on outdoor play, child independence, and its warm, community feel—and it delivered on all fronts.

One of the selling points for us for us was the small class sizes. Our boys were in groups of just 6–12 children, not in a room of 30. This made a huge difference in the level of care and attention they received. Every morning began with outdoor play—rain or shine. On rainy days, the kids were bundled up in raincoats and boots, and we absolutely loved this commitment to outdoor time and resilience.

The small size of the school means the staff can really tailor care to each child. Toilet training, for example, was handled with patience and support. All staff knew the children and families well, which created a strong sense of connection and made for a gentle, nurturing transition into school life.

Healthy, varied meals are provided, and the children are introduced to cooking activities from as young as 18 months, which they loved. Forest school is also introduced to the kids around 4.

As a relatively new school, Nurtured Nest had a few teething issues in its early years—mainly around communication and some staff turnover—but to their credit, these were acknowledged and addressed. So please read old reviews with compassion, building a school is no easy feat! The team clearly puts a lot of thought into ensuring staff align with the school’s ethos, which takes time and required hard choices but pays off.

Our children were very happy there, and we were genuinely sad to leave when we relocated. Nurtured Nest gave them a beautiful, nurturing start to their educational journey, and we’re incredibly grateful for that.",2025-06-06T00:22:05.912Z,education

Nurtured Nest,5,"I was most fortunate to do my practicum placement at Nurtured Nest Preschool for 1 month in the capacity of a teacher-in-training while I was pursuing my diploma in Early Childhood Care and Education. The team of teachers are passionate for the children’s learning, social emotional well-being, and most importantly— FUN! The activities organised for the children are catered to their interests and needs, and are very much authentic learning experiences which engage the children’s 5 senses, and gives them plenty of opportunities to play and work with one another in the great outdoors. It is not your typical preschool where children are forced to sit down and listen to a static, academic lesson from a whiteboard, but instead a play-based school where they are fully immersed and engaged in their learning. Children spend lots of time getting messy and dirty in the sand and rain (with raincoats and boots of course!), creating masterful artworks with paint and loose parts and glue, or simply just having a picnic in the grass patch behind the school. This is not just a great school for young children, but for any potential practicum students who are looking for a unique, vibrant, and out-of-the-norm preschool as an attachment centre. Cheers to Sheena and the team for their hospitality, care, and professionalism as they accommodated me for the 1 month I was attached there.

The school really strives to create the best possible learning environment for the children, by continuously innovating, never getting complacent and always bringing new ideas and projects to life.
During her time at NN, our daughter has been exposed to a multitude of activities (mandarin, music class, ballet, musical show, art and craft, forest school and more) and has been continuously stimulated and engaged in new endeavours.
The management team as well as team of educators have always been very approachable and always very responsive and sensitive to every single query or concern we had.
We will always very fondly remember our daughter’s time at Nurtured Nest and look forward to enrol our youngest child as well.",2023-07-10T02:59:22.835Z,education
Nurtured Nest,4,"Our child attended Nurtured Nest for more than a year. I would give it a 4.5/5, and since there is no half star I’m putting a 4/5 here in Google Maps.

The good: Although the school itself is small, it has a beautiful backyard with a garden, pond, sand play, etc. where the kids can enjoy themselves during outdoor time. We value outdoor time for our child and NN provides lots of this during the day, sometimes even when it rains (the children are required to have raincoats and boots). We also resonate with the Reggio Emilia approach which the school follows.

The reason for half star: The school is relatively new, and still faces some challenges operationally, like turnover of teachers. However, I want to emphasise that through the challenges they faced, they never failed to provide loving care for the children.

Overall we are happy with the experience NN provided our child.",2023-07-03T02:38:13.096Z,education

My younger child now has the same privilege to be cared for by the same team of dedicated teachers (Luo Laoshi, Teacher Ram & Teacher Kavitha).

Curriculum wise, I had my concerns initially like most parents - shd I pay more for better academic focus? That's always the scale that most parents would weigh, but my concerns were allayed as I've come to realize that MFS is a good balance of both affordability and quality. My elder boy enjoyed learning through the various inquiry projects - there would be different themes each term and the teachers put in a lot of effort to pique children's curiosity via hands-on activity, parent engagement,  relation to current affairs and relevance to primary school. The teachers also took many pictures of my child in action and I can easily view the pictures weekly in the parents portal to see what they've learned in school. My boy excelled under this system and is now doing well in primary school with strong foundation set during the 2 yrs of his time in MFS.

Apart from its team of caring and competent teachers, the centre's layout is also a plus point. The classes are split into 3 different bays around blk 258/260, so cases of hfmd, and even covid were kept to a minimal.

Many parents who sent their children to this centre also echo my same view and thus I'd not hesitate to recommend this centre to my family, neighbours and friends.",2022-04-29T00:40:14.571Z,education

数年後の本帰国を見据え、お友達同士の関わりは日本語中心で行ってほしかったこと、見学の際人懐っこく話しかけてくれた園児たちに魅力を感じ入園させました。良心的な価格と年少以降お昼寝がないことも重要でした。
7校見学した末こちらの園に決め、実際通ってみた感想は、「行事が多く楽しい！」です。

Arts Junior Montessori Preschool,5,"Hi
I'm writing this testimonial with lots of love and gratitude for all the support and great services that the Art Junior Montessori had provided for my daughter.Siti Aisyah had an impressive progress in her tenure at Arts Junior Montessori, both her teachers and Principal were very patient and never had failed to keep encourage Siti Aisyah to improve her motor skills and communication.

My Daughter, Siti Aisyah was delayed in her speech and her motorskills .Since that first interview with Ms Shana in which she provided Siti Aisyah the opportunity to enroll in Arts Junior Montessori,  little by little she has been able to control herself by crawling and learning to walk/stand . This was all possible due to the staff dedication and strong work ethics commitment .

Both myself and my husband really appreciate all the effort, hard work, love and care that every carer has ever shown towards her. Enrolling my daughter into Arts Junior Montessori was one of the best things we’ve done as a family.

I would highly recommend to anyone looking for child care in this area. 🤗",2021-06-04T10:49:54.175Z,education

Arts Junior Montessori Preschool,1,"I would like to recount my experience at the school and for all parents to be informed. My child was severely injured with a bone displacement and fracture and was not given first-aid. The school also did not inform me of the injury and she was crying for at least 45 minutes till I arrived to pick her. She was clutching her injured arm, sitting beside two teachers who were nonchalantly cutting paper and not paying any attention to her. She was later admitted to A&E and was there for 9 hours.

We then found out that they had hired an illegal worker who was supervising the children. Unfortunately, the School avoided all responsibility and refused to meet with us nor the parents of the two boys who caused the injury. The School's owner (Ms Momoyo Misugi) also prevented one of the boy's mother from apologizing to us as she said that my father threatened to beat the boys. When we confronted her on this matter, she panicked (wondering how we got to know about it) and brushed it away saying that she may have misheard my father.

With regards to the illegal employment, the School maintained that the person was an 'observer' and was not paid. Other parents and I saw the person for more than 3 weeks and actively working with the kids. Not just observing. The School then told ECDA that the person was there for only less than a week.

For close to 9 months, Ms Misugi refused to meet us till she finally relented to pressure from ECDA (government). Even to fix a date for the meeting, she kept saying she was not free or was overseas. On a day that she was supposed to be away, she was caught red-handed by ECDA to be in the School.

With the influx of students since Jan 2017, there's been much overcrowding, poor control and hygiene especially at the toilets. The teachers look irritated and harassed especially with the younger children crying non-stop and their diapers falling off because the teachers are just overwhelmed with the number of kids.

They also sent us reminders of late payment on school fees during the months that my daughter was recovering from her fractured and displaced arm. We found that to be in such poor taste. We also had a hard time enrolling her in a new school as they did not release her name from the childcare link system. The School also refused to return us our deposit.

I also heard from another parent about her son being bitten by mosquitoes/bugs so badly he came home with 12 very swollen and lumpy bites all over his legs and body. The parents asked the school and they simply replied that there were no other cases so the boy must have gotten it from elsewhere. The parent was very upset with the dismissive attitude. She pulled her child out.

In my 1+ year enrolling my child in the school, more than 4 local principals/administrators came and left. There was also high turnover of admin staff. I thought something was very wrong when teachers also started to leave all of a sudden. I know of at least 2 teaches who went on leave and never came back.

Back in 2016/17, the school did not take temperature and check for HFMD. I am not sure if that is allowed. We highlighted this to them several times and they made some attempt of getting parents to record the temperature before coming to school. I believe this is not in line with ECDA's requirement.

Hope to bring awareness to other parents out there.",2018-05-31T02:07:58.112Z,education
Arts Junior Montessori Preschool,1,"In 2017, our 2 years old daughter started to go to Arts Junior Montessori. On 3rd day, when mother picked up our daughter, she was crying badly. Mother thouht it was just because our daughter didn't like the school so she left the school quickly. On their way home, mother found 3 injuries in arm (bleeding), knee and inside mouth (bleeding). We complained over phone but the school didn't admit nor apologize. On the contrary, they suspected she was injured after school and asked us the possibility of injury after school repeatedly even after we explained the possibility of 3 injuries without our perception was nil.

I was surprised and frightened with the fact that,
1.The school was totally unaware of 3 injuries. It's not easy to overlook 3 times injury ??
2. They didn't consider the possibility of injury at school even though they overlooked 3 injuries (paid less attention to children ??)

Unfortunately, our daughter was 2 years old and couldn't explain what happened at school. But she was really scared of the school so we withdrew our daughter next day. I heard at least 2 more incident at this school & those are posted to some website.",2018-05-29T16:26:09.934Z,education

We are Japanese and my son couldn't speak English or Chinese, but Ms Janice and the other teachers helped him get used to the school.
It has been five months since my son started kindergarten, and I am really glad that I chose Cheston. He quickly adapted to school life and seems to have grown so much. In addition to the daily activities, there are field trips, various events, and recently a school camp where my son stayed overnight away from home with his friends and teachers for the first time, and he came back feeling very confident.

It was a big decision for us to send our child to a local preschool in a foreign country, but now I feel that it was the right decision to send my son to Cheston Montessori Preschool.

Cheston Montessori Preschools,5,"My husband and I sent my 7 month old to Cheston at Clementi and it was the best decision we made. When we sent him, he wasn’t eating and didn’t show signs of having any tooth. We were highly concerned as to how he would do food wise in school. But over time and with a lot of guidance and patience from his IFC teachers, he was able to start on purées and fruits a little by little. And when he transitioned to porridge after turning 1, he did even better on that and slowly was introduced to more solids.

I appreciate the constant updates from the teachers and having an open line of communication with the principal put me at ease to know that my child was well supported and taken care of and that my concerns were always heard and responded to.

From my child taking his first steps to him learning to sit and read and focus on an activity, I'm very glad for his teachers and all the guidance, love and passion put into ensuring his growth.

I would like to specially mention his IFC Teachers Irene, Reena, Jes, Noraini and Principal Janice for every bit of confidence, love, compassion and care that they put into caring for and instilling values to my child.",2024-07-02T02:33:45.455Z,education

She finally settled down at Cheston Montessori and we’ve never regretted that choice as we watch her grow into a confident, cheerful, cheeky 6 year old. She has a better grasp of mandarin than her parents, her interest to read English story books albeit slow but is still beyond her age level, her ability to pick up basic maths concepts are always startling to us as we never sent her for any additional extracurricular classes after her Preschool at Cheston. The Cheston teachers’ patience, and interaction with every child in the school is evident regardless of the level of class they teach. All the kids know all the teachers and staff. The kids know every child’s name in every level too.

Cheston Montessori Preschools,5,"Cheston Montessori (Clementi Community Centre, Level 3)

We sent our first son to Cheston Montessori in Dec 2020, when he was 4 months old. Being new parents, we were initially apprehensive about sending him to infant care, and did not know what to expect. Our apprehensions, however, were soon dispelled. The staff were warm and friendly, patient with our queries, and accommodating about our requests. They provided us timely updates about the care and feeding of our son, were always willing to share about his day when we picked him up, and generous with advice without being prescriptive or intrusive.

All this would have been ample reason for us to give a 5 starred review. But Cheston and its staff went beyond this. They had an engaging programme for our son, teaching him many things and developing his growing mind through creative and age-appropriate activities. The staff made it a point to get to know our son as an individual, and share specific insights which helped us to get to know him better too. Their warmth and professionalism were instrumental in our son’s development, and their responsibility in executing their duty of care allowed us to return to full-time work without having to worry.

We have now sent our second son (4 months old) to Cheston, and are so glad to have their support and care again. Cheston has worked hard to make the school a second home, a second family, for the children, regardless of age. We are so grateful to them - and highly recommend them if you are looking for an excellent infant care and child care centre.",2022-09-25T13:55:37.853Z,education

ACS International,5,"I wanted a different experience for my older girl after PSLE and attended the open houses of all the local intl schools. We chose ACS Intl due to a few factors, proximity, Alma Mater of husband and from the general feel of the school. We noticed during the open house that the kids were allowed to present and run some parts of it independently. This was a good sign - didn’t matter if it wasn’t 100% perfection as kids would learn how to talk to adults and present themselves. We took the plunge and she was our guinea pig. She completed four happy years there and went on school trips where she learnt how to look after herself away from home. Prepared her well to study overseas. Teachers are kind and able to provide actual detailed feedback. As an example, I was told she could benefit from cooking more at home to help with her Chemistry practical skills which was very true. After that her sibling also joined the school and am happy to say the experience is consistent. If you want happy well adjusted kids I can recommend this school. I must add that bullying is not tolerated and the school is quick to address behavioral issues. In terms of academics your child should have no issues if they do their work consistently as tests are based on what they teach at school and the school has a good balance between work and play. For CCAs lots of options and chances to try new things. I have met random parents from the school over the years and most have used the word “thrive” to describe their child’s experience. Overall the intangible things I have noticed in both kids are an increase in confidence, they are not scared to sign up for new things and willing to take the risk of failure after one or two years here,  best is yet to be!",2024-03-27T07:36:18.849Z,education

My First Skool at Blk 656C Jurong West St 61,5,"My son attended My First Skool (JWC06) since he was 4 months old and now, he is in Nursery. Throughout his education at the centre, he had amazing teachers. The Principal and all the teachers are very warm, approachable, enthusiastic and caring in their interactions with the children and parents.  They are always updating me about my son during send off and pick up, updates in the communication book, child's portfolio, parents portal and meet the parents sessions are some of the useful communication channels  that I find useful to get insights in his progress in school.  The teachers make observations and document them to keep track of the children’s development and ensure that they reach their milestones. The teachers supported, encouraged and helped in other aspects such as doing daily routines independently, eating their fruits and veges and even potty training. The teachers, at every level built great relationships with him. This makes him feel safe in school and in turn, enjoys going to school.
The centre teachers take a lot of time and effort to make the classroom a conducive and playful atmosphere for the children based on the the different learning themes throughout the year. This sets an engaging atmosphere for them to play and learn. My son always talks about the different themes at the Dramatic Corner and Learning Centres that the teachers prepared. The centre encourage learning and bonding time at home with the take home activities that are based on the learning themes. The classrooms are clean and neat.  Baskets with learning tools and toys are organised neatly in shelves so that the children can easily pick them based on their interest.
The centre has a well rounded curriculum.  Some of the lessons that my son enjoys are music and movement, story telling,  phonics, gross and fine motor activities and outdoor walks in the neighbourhood. His learning experiences in the centre helped and encouraged him to be a curious learner and confident little boy!",2022-05-17T17:32:27.920Z,education

Although they do not have fancy ""app"" for parents to chat with teachers or school, however, all information shared timely to parents by call or daily communication during drop-off and pick up. Teachers will pay attention on the kids instead their phone, I think this is the utmost important that you do not wish teachers to check the phone all day.

Also, this school is pay seriously attention on hygiene, this is really important during COVID period. They follow the highest standard, deep clean every time when a COVID case reported. Therefore, even thought during pandemic period, there's no pandemic in this center.

The teachers at Brighton Montessori at Sunset Way have been so caring and helpful, and have kept her safe from the very beginning, for which we are immensely grateful. They would give us a heads up on any food-based activities, and would also try to source safe alternatives for her if possible. Special shout out to Ms. Sharmaine, Ms. Cindy and Wang Lao Shi for always being so thoughtful towards her allergies! They've even set up a snack basket for her for birthday celebrations; Wang Laoshi even went to the extent of specially preparing a safe MSW durian filling just so my girl could partake in the mooncake making activity!

We also really love the weekly outdoor runs the kids go on, along the nature canal where they can spot monitor lizards and otters!

Curriculum-wise, Brighton has a dedicated approach for English and Math, catered to each child's learning pace. Both my girls picked up reading very quickly under Ms. Sharmaine's guidance.

Nan Hua High School,1,"Dear Principal on Nan Hua High School

I am writing to inform you of a disturbing behavior I have observed from students of Nan Hua High School. Many Nan Hua students were very loud on the bus which my peers and I found very disruptive.

The Nan Hua students have also crowded around the bus stop and block the pathway outside the bus stop making it very hard to navigate without going off the path and onto the grass patch. As a small comparison conversations between the NUS high students cannot be heard.

This is not the first incident of Nan Hua students being loud in public and this behavior has been observed for months without noticeable change or effort to stop.

I would like to request that the teachers of your institution kindly advice students to try to be less loud and be more socially aware of their behavior and conduct when in public especially on public transport or public spaces during peak hours where there are members of the public rushing to get to their destination and it is already very difficult without the Nan Hua students obstructing the pathways.

Learning Vision Nanyang Technological University,5,"We have been with NTU@LV since my firstborn, who has since graduated to primary school, and now my younger child is here too. Over the years, we’ve consistently seen the same dedication and professionalism from the teachers. Everyone knows their role well, and we’ve never once felt that the teachers were unsure of what they were doing. They are patient, caring, and always approachable.

One of the things we truly appreciate is the open-door policy. Parents are free to walk into the classroom to send or fetch their children, and it gives us great peace of mind knowing that the school has nothing to hide.

My husband loves the school so much that when I once suggested transferring our child to a nearer preschool for convenience, he completely disagreed—because he felt the care and quality here is unmatched.

We are very grateful for the teachers’ dedication and genuine care.

Learning Vision Nanyang Technological University,5,"We absolutely love the teachers and the nurturing environment at this preschool! My kids are now in K2 and PG, and our twins in PG have been here since they were just 3 months old in infant care.

Like any parents, we were initially worried about our babies being in infant care so young but thanks to their caring IFC teachers (Teacher Joy and Teacher Yana) and the clean, safe environment, our twins thrived in infant care and transitioned to PG smoothly.

Of course, like any preschool, there are occasional outbreaks (e.g. HFMD), but the school always keeps parents informed promptly and sanitises the classrooms thoroughly.

One of my children’s favourite parts of the day is outdoor time; the school has a large outdoor playground and a grass patch where the kids get to explore daily.

The principal, Ms Jayne, and her team are always on the ground, approachable, and keep communication open. Thanks to them, we can go to work with peace of mind knowing our children are in good hands.

Then on the other side there’s those really nice angels who are actually nice and literal angels, and actually care to see the toxicity their schoolmates can inflict on people like me, who’re also extremely rational and don’t take biases.

They also have ballet and music classes which have helped him to be more aware of his body and movements, following the rhythm.

It s a small school, in my perspective much more caring than a big one ( where we went before ) , sometimes might feel less structured and organised than a big one, sometimes it s penalized by the proximity with GESS , but the owner is really putting her heart on it ( as well as her kids - which says it all) and our son is very happy there.",2023-06-22T04:21:43.152Z,education

Я уверена, что у моего сына будут самые теплые воспоминания о его детстве и времени, проведенном в садике ❤️

Alpha Green Preschool Bukit Timah,4,"This is a well-organised school.

Communication is frequent (I was receiving updates on what my son was doing daily!) and the bilingual immersion was an A++++. Nutrition wise - they offer a selection of healthy food for the kids to pick and choose. From the short stint when my son was attending Alpha Green, I noticed he became more open to trying new foods and was more independent in eating. His mandarin improved (he was able to sing twinkle twinkle little star in mandarin!) as well.

Would have loved to continue but cost is an issue for us, and for some reason my son didn’t quite enjoy himself (he cried a lot on drop off and expressed he really didn’t want to go), hence didn’t continue.",2022-05-27T03:11:27.494Z,education

She also is given the chance to interact and play with kids across the age groups as the school has activities for everyone to attend… and from the daily photos, interesting events like science projects or art projects can be held for kids of different ages.

Often when I go pick her up, she doesn’t want to go home because school has been so fun.
Whenever I go to pick her up, if I have time, the teachers will give me a quick update of how she is but besides this feedback, the school shared pictures of daily activities almost every day so I know what she has been doing (and to be honest, I’m quite jealous…. 😅 I wish I have this much fun everyday!)",2022-03-09T07:23:00.378Z,education

MindChamps PreSchool @ JTC Summit,5,"Our journey into MindChamps begin when Dexter was 18 months old. At
that point of time, we were looking to place him at a pre-school where
we will feel assured that he will be well taken care of, whilst both of us
were at work. Although that seems like a minuscule requirement of ours,
we were apprehensive after visiting several schools in the vicinity. As we
had nephews who were previously enrolled in MindChamps, we were
well aware of their branding and quality. We had witnessed our nephews’
progress and growth over the years and were impressed with the
outcomes.
Despite the overwhelming demand, we were fortunate to gain a placing
for Dexter in PG. He went on to spend 5 fruitful years in MindChamps
under the guidance of various teachers who have impacted his life. The
Principal, Ms Chris has been our beacon of light as we navigated
through Dexter’s early childhood. She was always just a phone call away
and a pillar of strength for us especially during the Covid period. The
teachers whom Dexter cross path with were equally dedicated and
remarkable. Ms Steph, who helmed Dexter’s PG to N2 class and Ms Zoe
who took over for K1 to K2. Ms Elli, Dexter’s phonics teacher and one
whom he looks forward to greeting every morning when he arrives at
school. Ms Xue, his Mandarin Teacher whom has miraculously made
him enjoy learning the language. Ah Yi, the chef who churns out healthy
meals for Dexter daily.
Both Mummy and myself are eternally grateful to all the staff at
MindChamps JTC as we understand that it takes a village to raise a
child. We want to extend our sincere appreciation and deepest thanks to
every single staff past and present. We are certain MindChamps has left
an imprint in Dexter’s developmental years and we have nothing but
positive memories of his time there. We wish MindChamps many more
good years in JTC and rest assured if we encounter any potential
enquries regarding preschool, Ms Chris’s mobile will be ringing.

Kensington Preschool,5,Our Children's House Montessori is a great school which follows the Montessori curriculum. My child is having a wonderful time here. The environment is clean and welcoming and it encourages exploration. She enjoys sharing her experiences with us and she has become more vocal after joining the school. The teachers are very patient and caring and my child talks about some of the teachers very fondly. Another good thing about the school is the curriculum. The hands on learning is something my daughter enjoys and I am gradually seeing some of the independence that you hear about in the Montessori system.  I am so glad we chose this school for her. Do look up this school if you want your child to be independent and engaged in his/her learning while still having fun.,2022-08-12T13:30:53.681Z,education

MindChamps PreSchool @ Holland Village,5,"My son has been attending Mindchamps @Holland Village since 18 months old. He became independent very fast in PG class and has since grown happily in the past 2.5 years.

One big thumb up for the school is its teachers. We can tell that the teachers care for the children with love from their hearts. They take care of their eating, napping, toileting, and also teach lessons and build their characters. They are encouraging when the children are hesitant to try new things, yet firm with what they can do and cannot do. They understand the different personalities of the kids and will adjust the teaching methods accordingly. They provide timely and detailed feedback to the parents. Ms. Alina, the principal of the school, is one of the most lovely ladies I have ever seen. She always talks with a smile on her face. Her tone itself is reassuring enough. She supports the children in every possible way that helps them thrive.

Another big thumb up for the school is its curriculum. The curriculum is well-designed with tons of enrichments. For example, the kids have their learning journey every month. My son is so excited to tell us about what he sees outside the school during his learning journeys! Every week, he is looking forward to the music class and gourmet moments. Academically, he is able to read and write simple words and Chinese characters at 4-years old! We do not need to worry about tuition for the transition to primary school, thanks to the rich curriculum at Mindchamps.

Overall, our experience with the school is very pleasant. I will not hesitate to recommend it to my friends.",2024-10-12T00:07:39.590Z,education

MindChamps PreSchool @ Holland Village,5,"We enrolled our daughter at MindChamps Preschool when she was 2 years old, and the transformation we've witnessed has been truly remarkable. From the very beginning, we noticed a positive shift in her demeanour, curiosity, and overall development.

MindChamps' holistic approach to early childhood education has played a pivotal role in her growth. The curriculum, designed to foster creativity, critical thinking, and social skills, has provided her with a solid foundation for learning. Through engaging activities like Champs’ Discovery and personalized attention from dedicated teachers, she has blossomed into a confident and inquisitive young learner.

One of the most significant improvements we've observed is in her communication skills. She now expresses herself with clarity and confidence, eagerly sharing her thoughts and ideas with others. Moreover, her problem-solving abilities have greatly enhanced, as she tackles challenges with resilience and determination.

Additionally, we're thrilled to note huge improvement in her Chinese language proficiency. MindChamps' immersive The Love for Chinese Language programme has ignited her interest in Mandarin, and she now converses fluently and comfortably in both English and Mandarin, a skill we know will serve her well in the future.

It's worth mentioning that my elder son also attended MindChamps Preschool from PG to K2, and we saw tremendous improvement in him as well. Witnessing his growth and development during his time at MindChamps was one of the reasons why we chose the same preschool for my daughter. The positive impact it had on my son's academic and personal development gave us confidence in the school's ability to provide an enriching and nurturing environment for my daughter as well.

Moreover, she is a very active child who loves performing. MindChamps has provided her with numerous opportunities to explore her passion for movement and expression through various activities in the Creativity and Theatrical Strategies as well as Neuromooves classes. These experiences have not only allowed her to channel her energy in a positive way but have also contributed to her physical coordination and confidence.

Beyond academic achievements, MindChamps has also nurtured her emotional intelligence and character development. She demonstrates empathy, kindness, and respect towards her peers, embodying the values instilled by the school.

As parents, we couldn't be more delighted with her progress at MindChamps Preschool. It's evident that she’s not only learning, but also thriving in an environment that values her individuality and encourages her to reach full potential. We're grateful to the dedicated teachers and staff who have played a pivotal role in her journey, and we look forward to seeing her continued growth and success in the years to come.

Thank you, MindChamps, for providing our daughter with a nurturing and enriching preschool experience.",2024-06-29T01:57:18.904Z,education

The Schoolhouse West Coast,5,"After looking at several preschools, we chose The Schoolhouse because we were impressed with them. The principal on our tour was able to concisely explain the educational/developmental goals behind everything at the school, from large-scale aspects of the curriculum to small-scale in-class activities. She could even explain the child developmental reasoning behind why the school purchased certain toys over others. It all seemed so thoughtfully designed.

My daughter started at the youngest level and continued all the way through (until the end of K2). She enjoyed going to school every day and always spoke warmly of her teachers and principal. She never felt stressed there, yet she learned so much that she is at a strong advantage in primary school. The Schoolhouse helped her through many of childhood's challenges with patience and experience, and my daughter and her classmates all grew to become great friends over the years. Her time at The Schoolhouse concluded with a delightful graduation musical that included many well-produced performances by the children and even the teachers.

Matrix Math (Jurong),5,"I am very grateful to Mr. AJ for accepting my lovely son, Jerel into the Matrix Math Jurong Family. Great communication between the parent/child and the center (Mr. AJ and the team). Knowing that I was unwell, the center constantly reminded me of the forthcoming lesson or changes to the lesson time so that Jerel would not miss the lesson as it was a critical year for all P6 students.

Mr. AJ will provide constructive and helpful feedback so that I can make wise decisions. Proposing alternatives / additional learning lessons to improve my son's learning in preparation for the PSLE in 2024.

My son's improvement from getting a constant average grade to getting a satisfactory grade is commendable.  Matrix encouraged Jerel not to give up; nurturing him to continue to maintain/develop an interest in doing Maths. The positive reinforcement does improve his confidence to a certain extent.

As the class size is small, the teacher (Mr. Foo) allows for more individualized attention which benefits my son to fit his learning pace/needs.

Jerel is comfortable with the Home-Matrix distance as it is a straight bus journey taking bus number 180.  Passing by the Jurong East Sports Centre simply brightens up his bus ride for tuition as he is a sports lover.  Convenient and with a coffee shop downstairs, Jerel always looks forward to attending the class followed by his favorite Kolo Mee before heading home.

I have confidence that Matrix will continue to help Jerel to build a solid foundation of knowledge in Maths and he will be able to meet his realistic academic goals.

However, no regrets enrolling here at all - it’s been 4 months, and the environment has turned out to be nurturing, and essentially a “home away from home” for my daughter. Trainers update (without me prompting) not only on her academic work, but even whether she has been picky with the food in her lunch bento! Theyre very specific on her areas of improvement as well, for example, what words she gets wrong in spelling and tingxie, what handwriting improvements she still needs to work on. They’re also very accommodating when I need to pick her up in a hurry, getting her ready to leave once I text so we can still make it out within the slim parking grace period at Thye Hong centre.

My Little Kingdom Preschool,5,"Dear Ms Yvonne Yeo and Teachers,

After watching the camping footage of my son Enxi and his classmates, may I share with you some of my thoughts.

First and foremost, I would like to say congratulations to you all. it is a very successful camping event. Enxi and his classmates did have fun and learn a lot.  However it is not only a simple excursion or holiday retreat.

As I can see teachers really designed a very meaningful and classical itinerary, from library to food court, from water park to supermarket, which covers almost all important scenes in our life. most importantly, kids were learning and being taught how to be social and emotional beings during this camping. i had never expected Enxi could receive education like this, which could be his most precious childhood or preschool experience and memory.

one more time, let me take this chance to say thank you, ms yvonne' s team, your pedagogical concept is fantastic and successful, your dedications to early childhood education are enormous and laudable! Good job!

She’s a wonderful cook who prepared delicious meals tailored to my recovery and adapted to our family’s preferences. With her around, everyone was well-fed.

Aunty Cindy was also great with our senior dog — it’s rare to find an English-speaking nanny comfortable in a household with pets, and we’re so thankful for that. She was lovely with my parents too, which we really appreciated.

As a seasoned nanny, she cared for our baby with so much patience, adjusting to her specific needs (like syringe feeding) and soothing her when fussy. She also guided my husband and me through newborn care — focusing first on my recovery, then gradually teaching us so we’d feel confident when she left. We would have had a much harder time learning to be new parents without her support.

Her calm energy was great help in soothing the baby and it didnt take long for us to trust her with our baby completely as it was evident that she genuinely cared for and adored the baby.

Aunty SG - Confinement Nannies and Babysitting Services,5,"FTM here - I didn’t have the best experience with my first nanny after my emergency C-section. For the 17 days she was with us, I barely got any rest and had to deal with and put up with several issues. When she had a medical emergency and had to leave, I decided to go without a nanny, but given unforeseen circumstances, I ended up arranging a replacement.

The team at Aunty Confinement were immensely understanding and quick to help with any questions or concerns I had. A special shoutout to Jaslene and Snow for helping to get a replacement sorted so quickly.

I was then introduced to Aunty Maggie Teoh (pictured), who truly became a lifesaver. In just 11 days, she helped me rest and gave me the confidence to handle my baby and breastfeeding/pumping journey without guilt. Maggie is proactive, patient, and always ready to share her experience. She also made sure I had delicious, nutritious meals while training me and my baby to manage feedings and time between feedings more efficiently. We are so grateful and highly recommend her if you’re lucky enough to get a spot - as I understand she’s currently booked through to next year!

Thank you Aunty Confinement and Aunty Maggie ❤️",2025-08-08T07:48:28.453Z,education

Before she left, she even helped us prepare for our baby boy’s full month celebration. It was such a bittersweet moment when she left.  I was really sad to see her go, but felt much more confident and ready to take care of the baby because of her.

First Steps Preschool @ Jurong,5,"First steps Jurong- previously called Kids Mansion is an excellent place to enroll your children.

My older daughter and her cousins, alongside with our friends' children were all enrolled to the childcare centre since PG and they have since graduated.

My younger son is currently in the childcare centre and loves attending school. He doesn't have reluctance to go to school every morning and he often shares his joy at school with us.

The teachers are warmth and helpful. Especially teachers like Teacher Zann, Diana, Ying jie, Doris, Anna,the Chinese teachers and many others.

They have a structural approach where by the same teachers takes the same year of students every year and we can witness the growth of our children in terms of behaviour and discipline

Some teachers will spend some time talking to you about the children's performance when you pick your children up from school.

They have a yearly concert for the past few years that was self designed, self choreographed by the teachers themselves and it was for all levels. This is a very good platform for children to showcase their learning to their parents. The level of performance is amazing.

I am also very elated to see how they handle students with special needs. We hear of very good feedback on this area too

The school was previously taken over by another owner and we could feel the difference in the environment. We were hesitant to continue our son in the school.

However, we are all elated and happy to hear that Benny is taking over the school once again. Benny is one very passionate principal who is actively involved in the school' daily activities.

We are confident that with his leadership once again, the school will be an awesome childcare once again!

If you want a centre that uses not just hard skills, but soft skills and also teachers who teaches with the heart, try this centre!

We highly recommend any parent to have a non obligatory chat with Principal Benny if you are keen.

Cheers!!!",2024-07-19T08:27:31.785Z,education

They look forward to going to school every day and adore their class teachers and teaching assistants. The school has an excellent Principal who has been with the school for many years. The school emphasizes an all-rounded education which prioritizes character development. As a full time working mother, I am grateful and relieved for such high quality of childcare my kids are experiencing during the hours in the day when I am unable to be with them. Continue the great job, Green Pastures staff and a big thanks to the Lutheran Church for its support in the Singapore early childhood scene.",2025-08-17T07:48:35.857Z,education
Green Pastures Child Centre,5,"We transferred our eldest daughter to Green Pastures Preschool for K2, and we were amazed at her transformation. When she started, she could barely recognize simple words and struggled with vocabulary compared to her peers. But thanks to the experienced, dedicated teachers, within just a year, she was reading and writing so well—we were absolutely amazed!

When our second child joined Green Pastures, we had to move her to a different preschool after we shifted house. However, we quickly noticed she was way ahead of her classmates, bored, and not learning much. The food also was terrible compared to Green Pastures’ delicious meals! So, within months, we transferred her back—and she’s now thriving, loving her lessons, enjoying the food, and very happy every day.

What I really like about Green Pastures:
‐Stable, experienced teachers who truly know each child (unlike other preschools with constant teacher changes).
-A large, safe outdoor playground
-Engaging year-end performances that build confidence and showcase their learning.
-Strong Christian values woven into daily lessons—something we deeply appreciate.
-easy communication with teachers and principal, frequent updates of photos and videos of their activities

After experiencing other preschools with our first two kids, we didn’t hesitate to enroll our third at Green Pastures. Highly recommended!",2025-07-31T14:59:40.593Z,education

The teachers are not only kind and dedicated, but they also care for the children. My kids learn to become more independent and confident—it’s a nurturing environment both academically and spiritually.

I appreciate the strong Christian values that are instilled in the children and the Christian stories and songs they learn.

The meals provided are always wholesome and tasty- my kids can’t get enough of the chicken rice!  The principal Mrs Lu is kind and goes above and beyond to support families in need, showing compassion that truly sets the school apart.

One of the most anticipated events each year is the annual concert. Watching the children perform with such joy and confidence is a real highlight. I’ve been amazed by how well some of the children speak Mandarin—their language skills are truly impressive

Green Pastures Child Centre,5,"This is a wonderful kindergarten that will see your child through from 18 months to kindergarten 2.

I am a mother of 5 and my 3 younger children attended Green Pastures. I have had the blessing of being a parent of Green Pastures for over the past 7 years. I've had other experiences with preschools in the neighborhood and in my opinion GP has been the best.

GP will bring your children up with LOVE and they are committed to imparting the right VALUES in them. Which is really all that these little ones need at this point in their lives. GP teachers tend to follow their class group from N1 to K2 which means the children do not have the stress of acclimatising to a new personality every year. This is something our family continues to cherish about this school.  This has provided our children with the sense of family within the school which has contributed to filling them with a deep sense of stability and the confidence to build strong relationships later on in primary school. Growing our children up in love and stability has become an underrated feature of our early education and this is what Green Pastures does best.

If you ever get to visit the school, you will be greeted by a warm red brick house and a beautiful playground set under the loving boughs of one of the oldest rain trees in Singapore. In the same way that this ancient sage tree is home and hearth to many tropical ferns, vines, squirrels, woodpeckers and other wonderful avian visitors - GP has provided my family with deep roots in love and my children the opportunity to use this support to go on to grow their own communities.",2025-05-16T02:05:22.383Z,education

Eshkol Valley @ Sengkang Pearl Pte Ltd,5,"My son, who is in N2, had a fantastic time attending the preschool in Eshkol Valley and genuinely enjoyed his time there. The first time I visited the school, I liked the school's atmosphere; the classroom was clean, colorful, and well-ventilated. I was also pleasantly surprised by how endearing the kids were. It spoke volumes about the nurturing and supportive environment they experience in class. My son cries a lot every time he has to go to school (he attended 2 preschools before). So I was glad at how easily he adjusted to Eshkol Valley. I am so grateful to the Principal and teachers who created a fun and engaging learning environment for him. Each day, he eagerly looks forward to going to school, and as parents, we couldn't be happier with his experience.",2023-07-01T21:43:36.159Z,education
Eshkol Valley @ Sengkang Pearl Pte Ltd,5,"My daughter 4yo and my son 2yo have been with Eshkol Valley since their PG age from 18mo. I have so much comfort from the teacher as anxious parent on how my daughter will adapt being separated from me to start her first day. The first 2 weeks was tough, my daughter would cry and throw out due to crying but teachers and the aunties there were so assuring and told me it’s okay and it’s normal. They are so patient to say it’s okay to needing to change her daily and mop the mess my daughter created due to all her crying.

The daily updates from principal/teacher via WhatsApp (now they have school communicate and photo sharing App) on how my daughter are doing for the first two weeks helped me to have a peace of mind and assurance. My daughter adapted and less crying very quicker than I imagined it would be.

She have learned so much in speech, identifying, socialising, writing, trying to read words, etc in English and even improved so much in her Mandarin.

My spouse and I seen how our daughter grew to become so independent and the things she learnt there are really broad and sometime in our opinion deep for her age, example identifying all the planets and remembers them, saying all the shapes include ‘rhombus shape’. etc. We too have our son joined the sister and seen him grew in fast pace especially in speech.

My son went through a tough 1 week of separation anxiety too but very comfortably adapted to it after and love going to school. Seeing him so comfortably walking in as if he entered his second home felt very comforting.

I love how the curriculum involve parents and children time to accomplish a task. It helps us to bond with our kids and also create meaningful moments and conversation around doing homecraft together.

All the teachers are so dedicated. Their love and care for the children can be seen on how they update you about your children. I remember indicating I wish my daughter to improve in her mandarin speaking in the next term during one of our parent-teacher meet, I saw progress of my daughter really improve in making initiative to speak in mandarin and identifying mandarin words.

Both my children love their teachers so much! Can see my daughter excitement everytime she talks about her teachers and about her day at school. And my son so happy and cheerful to see his favourite teacher at the door so welcoming. It is so heartwarming watch they enjoy school and know that they are in safe environment and are in good caring hands.

All in all, I would definitely recommend friends and families who are planning to send their child to school for the first time here. Both my children built a strong learning foundation here.",2023-05-31T09:35:24.100Z,education
Eshkol Valley @ Sengkang Pearl Pte Ltd,5,"4 years is a long time for a 6yo! That’s how long My girl has been spending most of her life fruitfully thus far! While many focus only on the so call pedagogy and brand, few actually experience the fruits and returns from the most established of the brood.

EV@sengkang pearl is a rare gem that stands out among the lot. When we first moved to the neighbourhood, like most parents, the hunt for a preschool ( or rather, nightmare) begun. We were either put off or turned away by the overpopulated preschools in the northeast region and the journey was disappointing, to say the least.

But as if guided by divine direction, we stumbled upon the “land flowing with milk and honey”, or Eshkol Valley in the bible (confessedly, I missed that in my own bible studies..). I must say that the first tour-around experience was the best, not becoz of over-promising or any dazzling opulence to the exterior, but the sincerity, warmth and now well behaved the kids were! Definitely sending!

In the four years, I saw how my girl with some speech delays initially overcame her challenges and is now able to read Roald Dahl, Enid blyton!the improvement is stellar.

Like many, her Chinese was atrocious but the patience and high standards of coaching has prepared my girl for the rigor of P1 higher Chinese!

On top of that, she has gained confidence from being a quiet and shy little one to quite a “performer” and story teller!

Values impartation is the next most imp thing that EV has gifted  my girl. The teaching cohort in the school holds on to strong moral values and expect the same of the children as they guide them to make the right decisions and differentiating right from wrong, yet being kind and patient towards those who err.

4 years has gone by in a twinkling of our eyes, and now it is time to bid fond farewell. Knowing that she is graduating, she has refused to even miss a day of school. Farewell, her first teachers school and friends!",2021-11-18T03:57:18.393Z,education

Even though he has graduated, the teachers still remember him when they see him. Now my girl is currently schooling there, she look forward to attend school daily and telling me about her teachers and friends when she gets home.

PEM Confinement Nanny Agency Pte Ltd,5,"It has been a wonderful 28 days with our nanny (#1623 Soo Saw Tin 苏素珍), who has taken great care not just of our baby, but also of me, my husband, and our home. She is very experienced, responsible, and meticulous. She never fails to wake up in the middle of the night to feed my baby whenever the baby stirs, and I have never once seen her sleepy or distracted on her phone. I can truly see that she sincerely and genuinely cares for our little one.

She treated our baby like her own — singing to her, playing with her, and always keeping a close eye on her needs. For the first two weeks, she patiently used a syringe to feed my baby because she was concerned the baby might not want to latch. She also patiently taught us how to take care of our baby, which gave us so much confidence as new parents.

Every dish of her cooking is delicious! She is very knowledgeable about confinement food, always mindful of what I can and cannot eat, and even makes the effort to ask my husband to buy ingredients that I enjoy.

She strikes a nice balance in her interactions — not overly talkative, but always cheerful and pleasant to chat with, which I really appreciate. She also keeps my kitchen spotless; I’ve honestly never seen it so neat and organised before. She even insists that I don’t wash anything in the sink so that I won’t develop hand pain.

All in all, I would highly recommend her to any family. If I have a second child, I will definitely want her back again. 🥰❤️",2025-08-28T04:35:25.080Z,education

From the very first day, she made us feel at ease and gave us the comfort and assurance that both our baby and I were in the best hands.

Her love, patience, and skill in caring for our little one were evident in everything she did. Whether it was changing diapers, giving baths, cleaning up after the baby, or soothing him gently to sleep, she approached every task with so much attentiveness and confidence. Watching her care for our baby not only brought us peace of mind but also taught us so much about how to handle those delicate newborn moments with calmness and love.

Beyond caring for the baby, Aunty Ah Poh also poured her heart into caring for me. Every meal she prepared was filled with thoughtfulness, delicious, nutritious, and always tailored to my personal preferences and recovery needs. It wasn’t just food. It felt like she was nourishing me with kindness.

What touched us most was how she always went above and beyond her responsibilities. Without needing to be asked, she kept our home neat, clean, and organized, creating such a comfortable and stress free environment for us to focus on bonding with our baby. She was never intrusive, always respectful of our choices and preferences, and gently guided us with patience as we learned to care for our little one ourselves. Her encouragement gave us confidence as new parents.

Throughout her stay, we could truly feel the genuine love and dedication she put into everything she did. It wasn’t just a job for her. She cared for our family with her whole heart, and that made all the difference during this precious but challenging time.

We are so grateful for Aunty Ah Poh’s presence in our home.

PEM Confinement Nanny Agency Pte Ltd,5,"We have been very fortunate to have had Gold Nanny Auntie Lemon (#2150) with us in the past month, taking care of both baby and myself. From the moment she arrived, we were impressed by her professionalism and organization skills.

My priority has always been caring for baby, and on this front she has been excellent. She is hygienic and clean, washing her hands often when handling my baby. Having had a few nannies in the past, I also find her  gentle and careful when handling my baby. Auntie Lemon has also laid the foundations for good, practical sleeping routine (getting baby used to sleeping with background chatter, not picking up baby unnecessarily), which I very much appreciate as a mother of 2 other young (and noisy) kids. Beyond that she’s worked tirelessly to care for baby and ensure that I get enough rest.

Her cooking is also tasty and she makes it a point to tailor it to my preferences. She’s able to cook a variety of delicious and nourishing food, and even found time to bake a chiffon cake for us!

Auntie Lemon is also warm and easy-going, which has made the experience all the more enjoyable. She got along well with my helper, and even my very wary toddler has grown fond of her during this time.

I highly recommend Auntie Lemon if you’re looking for a dedicated, loving, and skilled nanny. She has made my confinement such a positive and easy one, and I’m very grateful for her support.",2025-08-28T02:26:24.118Z,education

She is a knowledgeable nanny that saved me and my husband’s life!

Peng Jie advised to give ruyi oil, massages, exercises, gripe water, ridwind as she sees our baby bloated (which as a first time parents we have no idea of). Peng Jie was so patient with our baby, carrying her and coaxing her until baby finally falls asleep.

Most of all, we’re especially grateful for the way she cared for our baby both day and night, allowing us to get much needed rest during this period. Knowing our little one was in her capable hands gave us so much peace of mind.

Jenni truly lives up to the name of a “Gold Nanny”! She’s caring, professional and wholehearted in everything she does. We couldn’t have asked for a better nanny to accompany us through this important phase of our lives. Highly recommended!",2025-08-24T08:15:35.155Z,education

Sheffield Kidsworld ( St Anne) Pte. Ltd,5,"We are so grateful to have found Sheffield Kidsworld (St Anne) for both our sons. The school has a strong focus on instilling values like responsibility, independence and beliefs about environmental sustainability from an early age, and the children are constantly engaged in activities that foster creativity, imaginative play, and speech expression. The Friday pool time is always a highlight for the children!

Class sizes are small, allowing each child to receive individualised attention. The school’s facilities are also excellent — with many varied spaces that ensure a rich and diverse learning experience. We also appreciate the frequent updates from the teachers regarding our children’s behaviour and progress, keeping us closely connected to their learning journey.

One instance that reflected the school’s dedication to safety was when a teacher immediately flagged my helper who was not careful when crossing the road with my child.

Our elder child, who was initially hyperactive, was nurtured with patience by caring teachers like Teacher Muna and Su Laoshi. Thanks to their support, he gradually learnt to settle down and thrive in a classroom environment. Numeracy and literacy were also very well covered; we never had to send our boys for additional enrichment classes like I Can Read or Berries. The Chinese spelling list was challenging though. Both my boys developed a strong foundation that prepared them well for primary school.

What truly sets Sheffield Kidsworld (St Anne) apart is Mr Puhal, the principal. He knows each and every child by heart and is always eager to share his teaching philosophy and suggestions with parents. It has been a privilege to have placed both our sons under his leadership and care.

Prior to enrolment to Sheffield Kidsworld, my son had a traumatic experience after 2 days of school in little footprints at 420 Sengkang. Son was not keen to attend any childcare school after the traumatic incident in his previous childcare centre. Had sleepless nights and not able to focus on any learning.

We had continued to source for preschool for my son. Chance upon on Sheffield Kidsworld, I call up the principal, Mr Puhal. He was patient and empathetic towards our son”s situation. He had a  close discussion with parents on how to help my son transit back to preschool effectively. Teachers at Sheffield Kidsworld were also informed of the traumatic experiences in the previous childcare centre and with their patience and dedication help my son transit and cope well in school now.

Through the last few months, I had observed my son effective transition into this childcare centre. He was initially still not keen or not able to cope with school. Through the compassion, care, patience and effective discussions from the principal and teachers from Sheffield Kidsworld at St Anne, my son is now able to transit effectively into school life. My son is happy and proud to attend school daily. I had also seen changes in my son learning. He is very keen in learning now. Had also participated in activities in school and is proud in going to school daily now.

I had also observe the school teachers on the childcare focus on the holistic development of my son since the day he started at Sheffield Kidsworld  St Anne.
I know that the school had provided a nurturing environment for effective learning as well

Lastly, I will like to take this opportunity to post this review as well to thank all the help especially to principal Mr Puhal, teachers- Muna, Sun Lao Shi, Stiffany for the dedication, patience and compassion in helping to nurture not only my son and all the children in Sheffield Kidsworld St Anne.

Sheffield Kidsworld ( St Anne) Pte. Ltd,5,"My daughter has been with Sheffield Kidsworld @ St Anne’s since she was just 18 months old, all the way till her graduation. Before enrolling her, we searched high and low around Rivervale Estate for a preschool that could accept her as soon as she turned 18 months. We were fortunate to come across this hidden gem tucked away in a corner.

We were even luckier that the school accepted her early, even though it meant she had to stay in PG (Playgroup) a little longer than most. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise, especially because of Teacher Muna—who, despite not being a parent herself at the time, took amazing care of our little one and guided her with so much patience and love. Taking care of toddlers at that age is no easy feat!

Over the years, my girl blossomed. She became more bubbly, confident, and even got selected as one of the speakers at her graduation concert—a moment we’ll always treasure. The teachers, principal, and the management team are truly top-notch.

Gladys Care 1987,1,"VERY Negative Experience with Gladys Care 1987 (Gladys Care)

My wife and I engaged Gladys Care 1987 (Gladys Care) for a confinement nanny in August 2023. We paid half of the agreed sum as a deposit. We informed the agency of our baby's expected delivery date (EDD) of March 20, 2024, and as per the contract, the nanny was supposed to be on standby one week prior to this date.

Upon admission to the hospital on March 20, 2024, at 4:30 PM, we promptly informed the agency of our imminent delivery. Our baby was born on March 21, 2024. However, the nanny only arrived on March 23, 2024, which was two days late. While we reluctantly accepted this delay, it was contractually unacceptable. The nanny was supposed to be on standby in Singapore, not in Malaysia, as the delay resulted in an extra night at the hospital.

During her tenure, the nanny’s service was causing worry, with her falling asleep during night shifts, causing distress to my wife. Despite these issues, we chose not to complain and worked directly with the nanny to ensure she got enough rest. (However, she is nice person and got along really well with us. She cooks well too and genuinely care for our baby! Shoutout to nanny Juliana, the one star i left on this review is for her!)

As the nanny’s term was ending on April 19, 2024, a conflict arose. The agency was demanding the remaining deposit, and we requested a discussion for a discount due to the nanny's late arrival. We held back the payment but never displayed any intent of not paying.

On the last day of the nanny's service, we were hosting a party at 7 PM to celebrate our baby’s full month. The nanny, whose shift was to end at 12 PM, informed the agency she would stay for the party and return afterward.

Meanwhile, we tried to reach the agency for a compromise on the fees, but Gladys did not respond.

At 6 PM, Gladys came to our unit, behaving rudely and accusing us of forcibly holding back the nanny and refusing to pay. Instead of engaging in an amicable discussion, she shouted at us and even involved the police, claiming it was her professional duty to ensure the baby was fine.

However, after the police left, no further checks were made on the baby, contrary to her assertion. Her actions ruined our party.

The police, after hearing both sides, found her unreasonable and acknowledged that she did not follow the contractual agreement. Although we paid the remaining deposit as she refused to negotiate, the police affirmed that we had the right to write a review or make a complaint to CASE.

Despite the distress caused by Gladys, we initially chose to let it go. However, we later discovered she had deliberately informed us late about the nanny’s work permit post-service process, resulting in an extra two weeks of work levy payment.

This was the final straw. To anyone considering Gladys Care, we strongly advise against it. Our experience, from the initial delay to the unprofessional and rude behavior of Gladys, was a nightmare. Even the nanny herself was shocked at the way the agent handled the situation.

For anyone looking for a confinement nanny, avoid Gladys Care / Gladys Yip at all costs. The stress and unprofessionalism are not worth it.

Gladys Care 1987,1,"poor experience with the nannies from this agency. Although the agent was responsive and tried to salvage the situation, the quality of the nannies are really poor.

First nanny - obsessed with her phone (did not turn off notification sounds), did not burp baby sufficiently resulting in frequent vomiting, used phone while taking care of baby. Unhygienic practices of letting bb drink unfinished formula milk after 1-2 hours. Complained to us about her pay and helped herself to our food w/o asking.

(Add on a point on the vomiting, apart from over-feeding that resulted in frequent vomiting (projectile vomit, not spitting milk), it was established that the nanny didn’t burp the baby sufficiently which resulted in baby vomiting in her sleep. Now, this is dangerous. The vomiting part is still manageable. Vomiting in sleep is not acceptable!)

Replacement nanny - not trained in confinement (machiam like housewife). cannot wash anything clean (milk bottles were oily after she washed). cooked about less than 1l of red dates tea for me initially and had to tell her to cook more. prepare herbal bath one time and use for 2 days (the herbal water kept till smelly). Complained about us over the phone and kena caught because we could hear from baby monitor. Food was the same everyday, tasteless sometimes and very repetitive. She cooks the same few veggie, chicken and rarely fish. Husband asked her what fish to buy she told us to ask the fish monger. Dismissed her finally because she gave bb formula milk every hour during the night shift because she didn't know why baby was crying and kept feeding bb milk.

Both nannies do not know how to update logs - time, amount of feeding, time of poop etc.

These are just some of the issues highlighted. Overall, the quality of the 2 nannies provided to me are poor, not professional and do not appear to be well trained. Really regretted taking this agency.",2023-10-26T02:30:54.521Z,education

Gladys Care 1987,5,"Background:
We hired nanny Jenny from Gladys agency for our first born baby. As we had no experience with baby care at all. We have a European background and the Asian confinement services were new to use.

Experience: outstanding/ superb (🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 5/5)
When returning home from the hospital, where my breastfeeding journey did not wanted to start properly, with our firstborn whom we did not knew yet (or fully understood): we arrived home and nanny Jenny was there! Immediately helping out and teaching us everything (as we are quite hands on parents we enjoyed being involved). Nanny Jenny has been our superhero throughout the journey! She has taught us everything about baby care, sleeping, soothing, bathing, feeding, caring, day and night routine, baby gym and so much more.

Nanny Jenny is very proactive, hands-on, solution oriented. When she noticed our baby struggled with Jaundice, our baby had sunbathing moments. When she noticed a blocked nose, it was immediately resolved. When our baby was a little older and he had long nails, she cut them. When our baby had cramps, nanny Jenny knew what to do. And there are many more examples.

Nanny Jenny has set us up for success with our firstborn. Because of her, we felt confident to take care of our baby, we felt we knew our baby, we understood his different cries and we had created a good baby routine. This would not have been possible without her.

Aside from that, nanny Jenny has helped me enormously in the breastfeeding journey. It was a painful journey and I would have stopped already without her. However, she knew all tips and tricks to make it more comfortable, to have less pain, to better latch the baby, to prevent bleeding nipples etc. And I am very thankful to her. As breastfeeding is a special intimate moment between mother and child!

Nanny Jenny is a very genuine, warm hearted, fun person. Aside from her 10+ experience in the baby care / confinement industry, she is also a wonderful person to have in your house.

Last but not least, Gladys services have been excellent. Aside from the nanny services, I went for belly wrapping massage and it made a big difference! During the massage, Gladys noticed my low blood pressure and recommended me a specific TCM tea. Which she bought for me and brought along to the next massage. This customized treatment is superb! Also I had a lactation massage, which has been such a relief ever since. Before of the massage my breasts were quite hard with a lot of knobs, and after the massage the milk is flowing with any hard knobs in there. Gladys has outstanding knowledge and really knows what she is doing!!

Thank you so much for everything!! I will contact you for my second child 🥰",2023-09-07T02:49:13.974Z,education
Gladys Care 1987,5,"Nanny Julie stayed with us for two months. She’s very professional and experienced, very open to our suggestions. She never argues with us and always incorporates our requests into her routine. Julie is also very attentive and patient with the baby. She goes out of her way to make sure baby is always healthy and comfortable.
In the baby’s second month, he stayed up all night and slept sporadically in the day. Julie stayed up carrying baby all night despite being very tired, and used various methods to ensure that she was alert.
In two short months, Julie has become a part of our family. She gets along with everyone, including my mother in law and my helper. She is a joy and I strongly recommend her.

Mrs Wong from the agency was also really good to work with. She was flexible and understanding. Really happy that I found this agency.",2023-08-23T06:38:01.711Z,education

She helped me tie over the second month with the newborn and 2 other young kids as I didn't get the rest I needed with the previous nanny from another agency.

Nanny yuzhu was very patient with the baby and proactive with the chores and setting up a good routine in the house. I have learnt much from watching how she handles the different things needed to be done in a typical day and am implementing it in my own routine now that she has left.

I wanted to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional dedication, patience, and care you show each and every day towards my son , Muhammad Zuhair from K2 Gracious.

From the thoughtful lessons to the encouraging words and the safe, nurturing environment you've created, it’s clear that this is more than just a school—it's a community built on commitment and compassion.

Thank you for not only educating minds but also inspiring hearts. Your work shapes the future in ways words can hardly capture.

Please know that your efforts do not go unnoticed and are deeply valued by our family.

Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool at Ang Mo Kio,5,"As a first-time parent, I was so nervous about leaving my baby in someone else's care, but I couldn't be happier with our decision to enroll at this infant care center. The teachers are absolute angels—they're incredibly caring and professional, and it's clear they love what they do. The facility itself is spotless, bright, and so well-equipped, and I have complete peace of mind knowing my little one is in such a safe environment. With a fantastic 1:3 teacher-to-baby ratio, I know my child is getting all the personal attention they need to thrive.
The communication from the teachers is simply outstanding. They use an app that provides real-time updates on everything—from feeding and diaper changes to nap schedules. It’s so reassuring to get those notifications throughout the day. Plus, they always share photos of all the fun activities! We get to see our baby enjoying tummy time, playing with new toys, and interacting with their friends. It's truly a highlight of our day to see those little snapshots.
This center goes above and beyond to make every day special. They plan daily activities that are both fun and enriching, and they do an amazing job of organizing special cultural celebrations and holiday events. Getting those adorable photos of our baby in their holiday outfit is just the sweetest thing! This center is more than just a daycare; it's a supportive, loving community, and we couldn't be more grateful for the incredible care our baby receives.",2025-08-20T23:34:30.249Z,education

Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool at Ang Mo Kio,5,"I wanted to share our positive experience with Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool, especially for our son. He has been attending the school for the past four months, and we have noticed tremendous growth and development during this time.

Firstly, my son has adapted exceptionally well to the school environment within just two weeks. It's been heartwarming to witness his enthusiasm for going to school every day. He has even started sharing the names of his teachers with us, including TR Maria, Hu Lao Shi, Chen Lao Shi, and Aunty Kim. This shows that he has built a good rapport with the teachers and feels comfortable in their presence.

One thing that sets Sunny Bunny Montessori apart from other preschools we considered is the evident love and care provided by the teachers. The atmosphere at the school radiates warmth and positivity, making it a nurturing environment for children. It's reassuring as parents to know that our child is in such capable hands.

The school's curriculum and activities have also contributed to our son's growth. Through the pictures and videos shared on the school's application, we can see that he has daily playground sessions and afternoon language sessions, where he is exposed to Mandarin. It's truly impressive that he is already able to speak some Mandarin sentences.

My son's love for the school extends beyond the classroom. He often recites the songs he learns at school, especially the phonics songs, when he's at home and even before going to sleep. This demonstrates the positive impact the school's teachings have on his learning and enjoyment.

Lastly, we appreciate the monthly field trips organized by the school, which allow us as parents to tag along. These outings not only provide an opportunity for us to bond with Davian but also help us feel more involved in his preschool experience.

He looks forward to going to school everyday and so far he didn’t get sick. Compared to the previous franchised pre school that we sent him to, he go sick every two weeks in the previous school and we were unable to send him for full day curriculum.

Sunny Bunny Montessori has very strong academic curriculum as well. My son develops cognitive and language skills quickly from the school curriculum. He can even recognise Chinese characters and enjoys reading. He develops good habits that he finds books to read on his own. He enjoys singing the songs learned from school and showcased to us when gets back home.

I can tell that the teachers are truly caring and my son loves all the teachers. He will repeat saying teacher Maria, chen laoshi, hu laoshi, teach Lindy at home.

The school also organises monthly excursion trips and my son also enjoys going to it. This creates valuable bonding time between the children and parents. The teachers also planned the itinerary very well, full of fun and something to take away.

Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool at Ang Mo Kio,5,"Our daughter went to Sunny Bunny when she was only 18 months old. At first, we were quite worried about whether she could adapt. It was during COVID then, and we seldom brought her out, so she became very attached to us so much so that when she goes to somewhere unfamiliar, she would became very nervous. But surprisingly, she adapted to life in Sunny Bunny very quickly and very well! Only a few weeks in, we could tell that she became more outgoing, more confident and more sociable. After 2 months when she was about 20 months old, we were confident enough to allow her to take the school bus on her own, and she enjoyed it very much. It was such a relief for us and we are very grateful to the school.

The teachers in Sunny Bunny are very caring. Special thanks to Teacher Maria and Chen Laoshi!! They're very patient, and attend to every child's individual needs. One of the many examples - Because my daughter usually takes a long time to finish her meals, Teacher Maria and Chen Laoshi would specially prepared small bite-sized apple cubes for my daughter. They would mix it into the rice, to encourage my daughter to chew more. They would  also always try to make sure that she finishes her food.

The overall environment in Sunny Bunny is very warm and welcoming. Thanks to the Montessori method, my daughter is familiar with all teachers and students in the school. She likes to take care of the younger ones and newer ones in school, just like how she had been taken care of when she first went to the school. She has a lot of friends in the school, and she even knows all their siblings by name as well!

Academic wise, Sunny Bunny is very strong, especially in the Chinese language. We were very pleased to see that my daughter was able to recognize a whole stack of Chinese characters, and able to read when she was 3 yo. There are other enrichment classes embedded into the curriculum, like Ping Pong class, Robotics, gym class, and these are all my daughter's favourites.

I would recommend Sunny Bunny to any parent who want their children to be in a caring school with strong academics and a fun curriculum.",2024-02-18T00:29:48.069Z,education
Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool at Ang Mo Kio,5,"Sent my 5 children to Sunny Bunny Montessori, with my youngest enrolled and having a fantastic time there. She adjusted to the environment very smoothly on the first day, all thanks to the nurturing teachers and environment. No crying and separation anxiety at all.

For parents still contemplating whether to enrol, this childcare centre is indeed a good choice. I had past experiences enrolling my 2 older ones in a branded childcare centre with many branches (many franchised) but had withdrawn them to join Sunny Bunny Montessori. When assessing a childcare centre, understanding the management’s commitment to taking care of staff and children’s needs is crucial. I am thankful to have come across Sunny Bunny and have a peace of mind at work.",2024-02-07T00:19:48.053Z,education
Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool at Ang Mo Kio,5,"We’re so happy and glad to send our girl to Sunny Bunny Montessori. We regret never send her earlier when we tour the school when she was 3yrs old. We sent her to other childcare and she never show any enthusiasm nor learning anything.

Ever-since she joined Sunny Bunny Montessori, everyday she is looking forward to go school and every night she too excited to sleep.

Besides that, she also improving on her life skills such as button her own clothing, eating meal by herself. Her motor skills improved as well by doing a lot of outdoor gym and indoor ping pong and rock climbing.

The most surprising is that her Chinese from she doesn’t know how to speak and now she can even pronounce difficult chinese words and read in sentence and paragraph within a month.

And we also witness she dare to kick off diaper wit the encouragements from her loving teachers.

We really grateful and appreciate to the warm, loving and patience Teacher Nayak, Li Lao Shi and Ms Ang. Beyond words to express how we feel, we really so glad that our girl is part of Sunny Bunny Montessori Family.

Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool at Ang Mo Kio,5,"I send my 3 kids (2 boys and 1 girl) aged 2 years apart to Sunny Bunny Montessori since 2017. Most importantly, my kids received excellent preschool education with dedicated teachers & excellent facilities, especially with the Montessori way of imparting knowledge.

My eldest boy has special needs, and Sunny Bunny was able to conduct some early intervention techniques. I guess that is the wonder of the Montessori way.

Another aspect of Sunny Bunny is the Mandarin curriculum. Simply amazing. Every child is guaranteed to recognise 4000 Mandarin characters before entering Primary school. Their exposure to Mandarin at such a young age and ability to read Mandarin characters was astounding to me.

Sunny Bunny has robotics (they send teams to participate in the annual robotics competition), gym classes, table tennis, Mathematics, Mandarin, English ALL in the curriculum, and year end, the children are exposed to preparing for the annual year end concert cum graduation.

The toys/equipment used for the lessons are top notch. Even during the Covid years when HBL was implemented, all the teachers at Sunny Bunny conducted full day lessons everyday through HBL. There were no making up of excuses to close down the centre for a few days just because of Covid.

Now that my kids have graduated from Sunny Bunny, I feel almost sad that my kids have left an golden era of being so well-taken care of at Sunny Bunny.

Dedicated Student Care Centre (Main Centre),5,"Dedicated Student Care is a truly commendable service that offers comprehensive support for students navigating their academic journey. The care provided is both holistic and personalized, ensuring that each student’s unique needs are met.

The standout feature of Dedicated Student Care is its focus on individualized attention. Whether a student needs help with academic challenges, mental health support, or guidance on career choices, the program is well-equipped to offer relevant assistance. The staff members are not only knowledgeable but also genuinely invested in the well-being and success of the students. They take the time to understand each student's situation, offering tailored advice and resources that can make a real difference.

Moreover, the accessibility of the services is another major plus. Whether through scheduled appointments, drop-in hours, or online support, students have multiple ways to seek help. This flexibility ensures that students can receive the support they need without adding extra stress to their already busy schedules.

The integration of mental health support within the Dedicated Student Care program is also noteworthy. In an era where student stress and anxiety are at an all-time high, having access to qualified counselors and mental health resources is invaluable. The program doesn't just focus on academic success but also prioritizes the overall well-being of the students.

In terms of areas for improvement, expanding the range of services to include more specialized academic tutoring or workshops on specific skills could enhance the program even further. Additionally, increasing awareness among students about the full scope of services available could ensure that more students take advantage of the support offered.

Overall, Dedicated Student Care is a vital resource for students, providing them with the tools, support, and guidance they need to thrive both academically and personally.

Grace Child Development Centre,1,"Reason: Arbitrary rules by this school.
Dont allow both parents to have a school visit to decide (even they disallowed 1 parent come another day).

Arbitrary rules for mask:
Even after there being no mask mandates by govt, the school force us to wear mask when we went to visit. (While Principal and some teachers were not wearing)

Principal doesn't even spare 2 mins of time to discuss or talk with us when we visit to decide for admission.And she is not teaching or attending any other person. Shows how much they care. Zero.

Unhealthy air. Its enclosed space with continuous room freshner running and emitting chemical toxins in air. Was hard to stand for 5 mins at the reception. Wonder how it effects children studying there.

Overall the place seems unwelcoming and not a nurturing environment for toddlers or young kids.",2024-02-27T02:26:23.626Z,education
Grace Child Development Centre,1,Not enough teachers for ar least 10 months and yet class strength is so full. P is unable to retain teachers nor hire good teachers. School curriculum is weak. Mainly let the kids do simple art and go for playground within the building. PArents have to pay for enrichment classes during school curriculum time.,2023-12-26T00:38:00.972Z,education
