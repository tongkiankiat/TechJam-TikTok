Dragon Seafood 龍海鲜,1,"Attitude problem. Looked at menu on top of sign board $5 ( pork rib rice )
Staff collect $6
I asked why. She pointed at the menu on the table. Told me to wait on the spot and not to sit. Apparently there are no table service. Staff was just playing in phone and does not need to serve other customer.

Ok fine. Went for a smoke. Staff just attitude and ask me come collect the food.

Items that came were below average and very salty.

No wonder it wasn't well patronised by the lunch crowd when there were only 3 food stalls open.

Pathetic.

Requested no pork or prawns for one dish due to religious reasons but they totally ignored and put those ingredients in anyway. Could hear the chef being informed but

When I asked for kway teow, the china woman rudely replied that there is no kway teow as if it was a sin to eat kway teow.",2025-07-22T03:43:34.380Z,food and beverages

Encik Tan,1,"Went to Encik Tan at NTU north spine canteen today and order chicken cutlet curry rice. Request for more curry gravy on rice and staff told me extra curry will costs additional $1. I was stunned. I did not expect a full bowl of curry but extra gravy to cover the rice as I like my rice soaked in gravy (see pic that the rice is clumped together and not every grain is covered with gravy). I mean it is personal preference and others may request for lesser gravy so they should not be loss. Will vendor charge less if asked for lesser gravy? In addition, it is common that most stalls usually more than happy to provide extra curry gravy. Further this stall is located in NTU where majority are students who are not working and the additional $1 for extra gravy is unjustifiable and ripped off. If there is miscommunication like the cost refers to separate bowl of substantiate amount of gravy, this should be communicated but the staff did not mentioned anything or clarified what I am asking for. Very bad experience and will never patronise this stall. A ripped off and unethical business model in NTU. Beware.",2025-03-27T15:04:35.813Z,food and beverages

Encik Tan,4,"Read the low reviews here, think that it doesn't do Encik Tan justice and here's my review:

Food: They sell your usual Encik Tan fares like Curry Rice, Fishball Noodles, etc. Not the best you can get, but definitely okay for its price. $5 for a standard set of curry rice (Add $0.30 for takeaway). Top-up $1 for a lime juice, mid-sized cup, okay for an individual. Damage less than $7 per pax, though there are more expensive menus.

Service: Like fast-food, prompt and neat. Payment options include cash and credit card. Strangely, they don't accept PayNow or PayLah, despite being in a university campus, which is supposed to be chic and trendy.

Atmosphere: I've been to other Encik Tan branches which was really bad in terms of hygiene. This branch within NTU is air-conditioned and relatively clean.

Overall, a 3 to low 4-star, but definitely not those low star reviews you have seen here, which are emotionally driven in my opinion, not fair from a food seller view by Encik Tan.",2024-08-06T06:34:47.429Z,food and beverages

Encik Tan,3,"Fast food version of typical Singaporean Peranakan Chinese cuisine. Don't know they opened an outlet in NTU campus until just recently. Predictably, the price is more expensive than comparable non-chain versions by $1-2 (most noticeably the noodles), especially considering such normal-ish portion.

The curry rice is alright, crunchy chicken cutlet size and taste are just fine, but the rice is too soggy especially when paired with the curry gravy. I'd say purely quality wise, the fishball noodle would sit in the middle of the pack compared to similar items elsewhere. For $5-6, I wish there's a bit more substances in it, for example more fishballs, mushroom, or dried anchovy.",2024-03-22T15:07:04.966Z,food and beverages
Encik Tan,2,Ordered that best selling chicken cutlet curry rice set and was very disappointed with the texture of the rice as it was too soft and too mushy. I did not like the chicken cutlet as it was also not crispy and it was very small compared to other ET outlets. I also ordered their star fishball chicken minced meat noodle and it had too much vinegar and mushroom was too bitter. Over put of sauce but the it was still not flavorful. Soup was nice though.

Really not worth the price tag. How can, and they are supposed to be famous with their nasi lemak right? Taste worse than Ananas.

Service: What service really, all self service le. And hor, supposed to have credit card payment on their screen. However when you tap on their kiosk, it is just qr scan payment... Seriously... Why bother having other payment mode when you don't support it in the first place.

Han's,1,"3 March 2022  - 1 have to walk around to find a clean table! The management should pay more attention especially now omicron is surging.

10 April 2025 -
I have been a regular patron, often coming in for lunch weekly. However, I’ve noticed that the tables are frequently not cleaned promptly, which detracts from the dining experience. Given the restaurant-level pricing, I believe maintaining cleanliness should be a priority.

Additionally, the meal packages, which include drinks, are priced quite high. This, combined with the cleanliness issues, has led me to reconsider how often I dine here.

I hope this feedback is taken constructively, as I have always appreciated the offerings of your establishment and wish to continue enjoying meals here.",2025-04-12T14:56:20.393Z,food and beverages

The pasta is truffle based (30 cents extra), the taste is great, strong truffle taste, the pasta is well cooked as well. Salmon is small portion but the tenderness was just nice, won’t crumble into pieces and not too tough. Spent 30 cents to change to mushroom soup but felt like the soup can be better.

The Soup Spoon Union,5,"Halal Food. The food is good, and you can add $4 for a set that includes an additional soup and drink. The normal set costs $12.90. The staff mentioned that NTU has its own menu, which is different from other branches.

For the main course, I highly recommend the salmon (an additional $2). It is much meatier and more flavorful than at other places in NTU, but it tends to run out quickly. The sides (2 out of 3 from french fries, broccoli and corns) are served in large portions. For the soup, the mushroom soup is the safest option; tomato soup could be sour to some; pumpkin soup could be weird to some. The tea is freshly made on the day itself.

The staff are very friendly and patient, willing to answer any questions you have about choosing your meal or the free membership.

I ordered the BEEF BOAT NOODLE DELUXE which is the most expensive among the boat noodle menu @ $10.90 a bowl.  It has a generous serving of tender beef slices, brisket cubes, tendons, and beef balls. These assorted beef meat are so tender, complimented with enough serving of  thin noodles cooked 'al dente', on a sour-sweet-spicy broth that is so refreshing to sip and slurp. The serving size and the delightful taste of the dish definitely justify the price. I also ordered their original Thai iced milk tea @ $3.00.  I'm not a fan of milk tea but ordered it just for the experience.  Fortunately, it is not the heavily sweetened serving that milk teas are known for.

Saap Saap Thai,1,"Horrible price system and money hungry service implemented, 0/5. Will not come back again nor recommend anyone from wasting their money.

After we paid and ordered a mango tango classic, we wanted to change the order to the one with ice cream which was one dollar more. However we were told by the counter staff that it will be $1.50 more because it will be considered an add-on. I asked ""can't change order?"" To which the lady replied ""cannot"". And that was just within 30sec of making the order, an order which she haven't even start preparing. She was the only staff there. I asked if the ice-cream version of the mango sticky rice was the same and the difference was just the ice-cream, to which she said yes.
We didn't wanna argue liao and so we just say ""nevermind"".

Next our order came and it was a super sour mango sticky rice, we rated 1/5. I accidentally spilled the coconut milk syrup cup, losing 2/3 of the syrup and we went to the counter to ask if we can have another cup of syrup. It was a sealed cup and it was strangely tightly closed, resulting in a accident.

To my surprise the staff said, if it's spilled at the counter it will be free and we will have to pay $0.80 for another cup of coconut syrup. That's really expensive for just a tiny amount of coconut syrup. We thanked her but told her no.

Times are hard but really don't need such horrible pricing system. Not allowing us to change our order was clearly a hard sell to make us pay more.

Was served by a lady in black, which according to the receipt should be the manager.  Much saddened by this experience.",2022-07-30T08:22:06.397Z,food and beverages

Al Sheika Banana leaf Restaurant Pte Ltd.,1,"To be fair, food was average and probably deserved 3 stars. What made my review 1 star is that the cashier whom I believe was the owner then was really dishonest (or probably racist)

Extremely overpriced, even for Raffles. Well, I'm definitely sure that there is a price discrimination over here when selecting from the array of dishes for the briyani/rice. When the cashier told me the price of my dish, he could see my shocked face then he immediately started justifying the price of my food which made me believe that the price of my food has been intentionally upsized.

Will recommend for you to come if you believe you will be served the actual stated price, if you're not feeling confident that you will be paying for what it is worth, I will recommend the many other food options nearby. Will be trying the other Indian restaurant just 1-2 min down the road the next time. Pure disappointment and poor business ethics, maybe he thought he got away with a little quick buck today however what he lost was the trust with potential regular customers. Came with 3 other briyani-loving friends, but rest assured we will never be coming back and never getting our other colleagues/friends to patron this dishonest restaurant.",2021-03-21T02:44:49.248Z,food and beverages

They need more recognition! I have tried all their dishes before and every dish is bursting with flavor, better than those “famous” stalls. And the prices are very reasonable. Honest foodstall owners are rare these days, they did not mark up the prices.

A big bowl of ribs, $5 and pig trotters $5! Where to find…. And the fruit juice stall next to it… $3 for apple yakult. A generous whole bottle poured in and what’s best is you can choose the flavour of the yakult 👍🏻

The team was incredibly friendly and efficient, and my order was prepared quickly and perfectly. The food was fresh, hot, and delicious, the Whopper was juicy and flavourful, and the fries were crispy and exactly how I like them.

What really made the visit memorable, however, was the manager. They were not only incredibly kind and welcoming but also went out of their way to make sure every customer felt valued. You can tell they take great pride in their work and truly care about the team and the customers.

Ordered three dishes and was thoroughly disappointed with the overall quality and preparation.
•	Green Curry: Watery and overly dominated by coconut milk, lacking any real green curry flavor. The brinjal was undercooked—practically raw. We returned it and requested a re-cook, but the second version wasn’t much better. It still tasted more like coconut water than curry.
•	Tom Yum Soup: Lacked depth—neither spicy nor sour. Ingredients were minimal: just two prawns, some frozen-tasting chicken pieces, and potato squid. Felt like shortcuts were taken with the broth.
•	Fried Thai Egg: While flavorful, it was excessively oily and heavy.

Although the pricing was on the cheaper side, the food quality fell short and were poorly prepared, with little care in cooking or presentation. Sadly, it’s not a place I would return to.",2025-07-12T14:51:17.587Z,food and beverages

803 Thai Food (803泰国小吃 @ Upper Jurong Road,5,"Undoubtedly, this Thai Zhi Char stall in the west can be considered as one of the finest establishments of its kind. I had the pleasure of visiting it for the second time, this time accompanied by my family, and it truly left a lasting impression. The sheer quality of the food served surpassed our expectations, leaving all of us thoroughly satisfied.

One standout dish that captured our taste buds and brought us immense delight was the Tom Yum soup. Its tantalizing blend of flavors, combining the perfect balance of spicy, sour, and savory notes, was a true testament to the chef's skill. Each spoonful of the aromatic broth was a burst of culinary excellence that left us craving for more.

Additionally, the fired Hor Fun with wok taste was an absolute masterpiece. The skilled craftsmanship displayed in its preparation was evident from the first bite. The flat rice noodles were expertly stir-fried in a scorching hot wok, imparting a delightful smoky flavor and a slightly charred aroma. The combination of tender slices of meat, vibrant vegetables, and the tantalizing sauce made this dish an irresistible symphony of textures and flavors.

Not stopping at these highlights, we also had the pleasure of savoring other delectable dishes that further enhanced our dining experience. The Thai Pandan Chicken, with its fragrant pandan leaves wrapping succulent pieces of marinated chicken, was a delightful fusion of aromatic herbs and juicy meat. The Garlic Chicken, on the other hand, delighted our taste buds with its rich garlicky flavor that permeated every bite, leaving us wanting more.

To complete our feast, we decided to try the Thai Cockles, and they did not disappoint. These plump and juicy shellfish were cooked to perfection, highlighting the unique briny taste that makes them a sought-after delicacy. The accompanying sauce added a delightful tanginess, elevating the dish to new heights.

All in all, our visit to this exceptional Thai Zhi Char stall in the west was nothing short of an outstanding culinary adventure. The food quality, attention to detail, and the overall dining experience were truly remarkable. We left the establishment with contented smiles on our faces, grateful to have discovered such a gem. Without a doubt, this place has earned our highest praise, as there was absolutely nothing to complain about.

Domino's Pizza Upper Jurong,1,"Ordered a large pizza and two sides for my mother's birthday

- delivery was late by two hours
- delivery wasn't picked up until 1hr30mins later
- pizza was cold, but the only good item I got
- chocolate brownies were tiny unlike the images they show
- garlic twisty bread had barely any garlic on all 6 sticks
- delivery driver dumped my order outside my apartment and rushed off
- not even a simple apology from the driver for the late delivery

I don't buy pizza often and I chose Domino's because Pizza Hut was going downhill, so I was shocked by the horrible service and food here too. In hindsight, I shouldn't have been shocked. Not buying from Domino's again either.",2025-08-18T13:41:13.471Z,food and beverages
Domino's Pizza Upper Jurong,1,"Certifiably one of the worst food delivery experience ever. Initial est time was <30min.

Called the manager after 45min had gone by, only for him to give assurance that it will arrive in another 30min.

Called him the second time after another 45min gone by, only for him to explain ‘if you order during normal time, we can deliver in 30min, if you order during busy time, it takes longer’.

Total time taken >2h. The dinner order for my family became a supper instead.

The manager needs to stop deceiving customers of delivery time. Last time I’ll order from here.",2025-08-10T13:27:38.965Z,food and beverages
Domino's Pizza Upper Jurong,1,"Made online order using foodpanda app. After half an hour, someone from the store called back and said that they can’t prepare my order and they will cancel the order from their end. It’s been 1 hour plus and no have cancelled the order and NO one is even bothered to answer the call.
Even I called the Mobile number of the person who called me, also not answering his call and after a while phone went switched off.
If don’t want to answer the call then why you guys have a phone in Store.

Bad store manager and management taking no actions on this.

Will make sure to block all my friends and known circle to have any deals with this store.",2025-07-09T12:40:16.681Z,food and beverages

Domino's Pizza Upper Jurong,1,"I purchased two Hawaiian pizzas from your store today, and I was very disappointed with the experience. The pizzas didn’t taste the same as they used to — the flavor was noticeably worse, and the amount of ingredients, especially the toppings, seemed significantly reduced.

I’ve always enjoyed Domino’s in the past, but this time the quality was far below what I expected. It’s really disappointing to see such a decline.

I hope you will take this feedback seriously and look into improving the quality of your food again.",2025-06-23T13:52:08.793Z,food and beverages

They haven't even started to prepare the order, status update not even there, I have work in a few hours, I ain't gonna wait 5 bloody hours for one pizza. I'm hungry af, and there's nothing I can do. Never ordering domino's from this store. It deserves 0 star. They don't even pick up their phones.",2025-05-11T07:37:42.647Z,food and beverages
Domino's Pizza Upper Jurong,1,"Service super slow and not attentive. Wasted 20 minutes waiting for the food that is sitting over there.
4 Domino store in Singapore given me disappointing service. (Tried 5 store in Singapore)
Luckily I paid $6 per regular pizza so I don’t expect they make another hot pizza for me.

TLDR:
I have placed my pick up order and 5 minutes before I arrive, food was ready to pick up. When I arrive I saw my food (only pizza) sitting on their cabinet. I told the person in red domino shirt that I am here to pick up my order. The guy in red shirt proceed to tell me to wait and he will talk to his colleague. Alright I wait for 1 minute, and he has his personal video call to make. So I sat at the chair there giving them enough ample time assuming that they are in the midst of preparing another order (assuming short of staff). But 20 minutes later, they started preparing another order which pisses me off. I approach them and they acted stupid like why I didn’t tell them I am picking up the order. The whole 20 minutes, 10 minutes I am standing infront of the counter (obviously, waiting in line), 10 minutes sitting on the chair patiently.
If is not your constant advertisement online, I wouldn’t try this another time.

Store owner:
I have attached my receipt, you can check your cctv of how I have waited for your staff. Even if you have heater for the pizza, your Aircond is quite cold too. The box is hot, the food turn cold 10 minutes after I left the shop. Not worth for pick up in this case",2025-05-10T13:26:54.434Z,food and beverages
Domino's Pizza Upper Jurong,1,"Ordered at 5.47pm through Grab, I called at 6.32pm for update and the staff said they don’t even have my order. So I said can I order through the phone and they said no have to order through their app. I asked for the staff to check on my order, he took down my details to check with HQ because I am unable to cancel on my end, and called me back at 6.59pm to say that my order has been automatically cancelled and won’t be charged. Guess what? At 11.47pm, my card was charged, order was “Delivered” on the grab app but nothing was delivered!
If you are only able to take orders through your app, please delete your grabfood account. Don’t take my money when you didn’t receive my order and didn’t deliver!!! You didn’t even properly assist and I got charged the amount. Zero stars.",2025-04-22T16:10:57.732Z,food and beverages

Domino's Pizza Upper Jurong,2,"I ordered Domino's for breaking of fast at 3.20pm on 23 March 2025. I chose the delivery time of 6:30pm. At 6:45pm, our order was yet to be delivered, however, from the live tracking on both the website & email, both stated that the order was being delivered. So decided to wait a little longer, thinking that the delivery could be a little later due to break fast time. By 7:10pm, the order was yet to be delivered. I called the branch from Upper Jurong since the order was coming from there. The manager from the said branch, named Dinesh, answered the call. It was stated by him that our order was number two in the queue & there was no delivery riders to send them out. We were shocked to hear that they had no riders at that timing, when it was closing to the time of breaking fast. Despite the frustration, Dinesh was still patient with us, through the call, & assured that we would be getting our order by 7:45pm. To add on, he said we could call them back if our order was not received by then. So we ate what we had first & at 7:45pm, our order was delivered. From the damped boxes & plastic, it can be seen that our order had been done way earlier but kept there for a while.
Thank goodness the food was scrumptious. It would definitely be more scrumptious if it was consumed when hot.
❗❗ALERT for other customers, pick up would definitely be  better than delivery. ❗❗

Suggestions to Domino's:
- have the time slot blocked, if you know that there wouldn't be any riders available at that time
- have a waiting time stated on the website or app, to alert customers for the wait
- if possible, have personal riders instead of external riders
- get riders from trustable sources & platform",2025-03-24T07:32:52.274Z,food and beverages

Reference to my order I wanted to highlight on the delivery I received.

1. Sprite x 2 bottle not received
2. 10 X Chili flakes and 10 salsa sauce not received.
3. Call upper Jurong outlet immediately after discovered above items missing, no one answers the call
4. The delivery rider just go away after put the items in our company pantry.. without confirming on items delivered.
What happens Dominoes?
How and who shall I claim back the items not delivered...just wondering if any of your people can assist me. I had call 1 of your branches at Nanyang who say his name was Said but till now I have not received any call ... What happens till now to my order of the 2 bottle of sprite and the sauces ...it's paid!! ..what I'm furious is the way your rider put n left the items without clarifying the items ordered.

Domino's Pizza Upper Jurong,1,"Absolutely horrible service. We placed an advance order the day before for a delivery for the next day at 1115. At 1145 we called in to check why there was no updates and the delivery status online was that it was already delivered. When we finally called through the staff told us they were still looking for riders. I don’t understand how they couldn’t have taken the initiative to call us first to update us? The staff then told us he would call back in 15 mins to give us updates. Not only did he not call us back but we couldn’t call through for the NEXT 3 HOURS. By 3 ish we finally manage to call through to get the refund. Absolutely horrendous service.

Please don’t order from here especially if you are buying for an event. Because everyone was so disappointed and we had to get some last minute food. We couldn’t even eat on time because we couldn’t get through their line to even check the status if it was on the way or not.",2025-01-29T10:47:41.051Z,food and beverages

Douraku Sushi,5,"⭐️
16 Aug 2025: The SG60 Omakase set menu is really super value for money. The quality in all the dishes are fantastic. Chef’s signature no. 1 roll is also bursting with flavour. Simply delicious.

6 Aug 2023: There’s a cheaper $60+ Omakase set for lunch and it’s very value for money! Ingredients used are very fresh and of great quality. Oyster is plump and juicy; otoro melts in your mouth, so does the A4 wagyu; scallop is Q-ey and good; Uni is buttery and creamy and sweet; yuzu ice cream is refreshing and satisfying!

Dec 2021: The $89 Omakase set might seem a little on the expensive side but it also comes with a bottle of sake. The chef’s selection is not bad and mostly fresh! Uni is not as sweet as expected but the salmon is fantastic as the cut has a good mix of fats in it making the sashimi melt-in-your-mouth 👍🏿

<Unagi don> pleasant to find that it comes with an onsen egg and jelly fish salad too. Love the egg as it add on to the moisture of the rice. The only thing that, the unagi is on the slightly saltier side, it would have been perfect if it’s lighter in the marination.

Disappointed with the In-Store Experience on 5 June

I visited the store on 5 June at around 12 PM, intending to place an order at the counter. Despite two staff members being inside, no one acknowledged me or offered any assistance while I stood waiting. It wasn’t until I had to call out to them that I was told to scan a QR code and place my order online.

This was extremely frustrating and felt dismissive. I had purposely come down to order in person, but instead was made to go through the hassle of signing in digitally just to get a pizza. If customers aren’t allowed to place orders at the counter, then what is the point of having one?

The entire experience felt impersonal and inconvenient. I hope Domino’s reconsiders this system and allows walk-in customers the option of ordering directly with staff.",2025-06-07T10:02:31.988Z,food and beverages

Domino's Pizza,1,"I am extremely frustrated with the service I received. I ordered $60 worth of food from Domino's NTU on FoodPanda at 5 PM, with an estimated delivery time of 40-60 minutes. However, after an hour, I still hadn't received my food. I attempted to call the store multiple times but no one answered. Additionally, I couldn’t reach anyone through the FoodPanda app since it stated that the food was being delivered by the outlet’s driver and couldn’t be tracked.
Another hour passed, making it two hours since I placed my order, and I had still received no updates. The app still showed my food was “preparing.” Finally, I was able to get through to someone at the outlet, but he sounded unsure and was unable to provide any useful information. He took my details, mentioned that the driver had been sent, and then said the food had been placed at the lobby . When I told him I hadn’t received any food or communication, he took my details again and promised to call me back after checking. However, no one ever called me back.
I then went to check in person, and to my disbelief, the food had been left outside on top of a fire safety box for over an hour without any notification. I called the outlet again and explained the situation, but the staff member(ANN)  defended the store's actions and claimed the driver had delivered the food.

Desal pooja Guan Heng Restaurant,4,"A nostalgic mini canteen near NTUC Learning Hub @ Benoi serves wallet-friendly bites in a charming 90s kopitiam vibe.
The Malay stall Nasi Goreng ($4) picked with crispy spicy chicken cutlet, telur goreng, fluffy rice, and a standout sambal that brings the heat and heart.
For tea breaks, the $1.20 curry puff from drink stall offers a crispy, comforting filler.
The Mixed Rice from chinese stall ($4.60) features curry-soaked grains with garlic spinach, brinjal, and fatty pork chop—salty and pricier but fills the tummy when convenience matters.",2025-07-17T11:39:52.813Z,food and beverages

The auntie might seem a bit grumpy at first, but she’s actually really nice. I asked to change one half to roasted, and she helped check if there was any ready at the back, had to walk all the way around the stall to do it too.

Uncle Leong Signatures,3,"Visited Uncle Leong Signature for lunch on a weekend around 12pm, and to my surprise, the place was completely empty.

We ordered a few dishes and unfortunately, the experience was quite disappointing. The fried ee mian was particularly bad — the oil used for frying tasted old and reused, which left a really unpleasant aftertaste. On top of that, the sauce was bland, and overall the dish just didn’t work for me at all.

We also tried some of their dim sum. The fried mango prawn dim sum was another miss — once again, the bad oil taste stood out, and the mango was bland and tasteless, far from the sweet flavour you would expect. As for the chee cheong fan and fried carrot cake, they were alright, nothing exceptional but at least edible.

Overall, I would say this place is just alright, but given the quality of the food, I would seriously reconsider visiting again.",2025-04-27T15:07:17.731Z,food and beverages

Uncle Leong Signatures,1,"Was there for our reunion dinner on 28 Jan 2025.  We booked the time of the dinner at 730pm but was only serve and provided with the seats at 830pm.  Nevertheless, the receipts ended up with 10% service charge.  As it is CNY, we did not dispute with the restaurant and made payment on that day.  It was after this that i checked on the CNY Menu we ordered and noted that there is indication that there is no service charge and the only ""+"" should only be the prevailing GST of 9%.

I what's app the restaurant and request for a refund of this 10% over charge.  Was immediately answered with a call from the restaurant.  The in charge highlighted that the 10% charged was not service charge but surcharge for CNY and claim that she had spoken to me before.  I do not recall this communication instead highlighted to her that the menu sent to me clearly indicated that there is only prevailing GST on top of the CNY menu cost and clearly states that there is no service charge nor CNY surcharge mentioned.

If the dinner has been good for this dinner, we do not mind to take this as a tip to the team and not asked for this refund.  However, the reunion dinner was delayed from 730pm to 830pm and by the time ended was closed to 11pm.  My dad (elderly) was left with hungry stomach and food served around 9pm were not freshly prepared with some dishes already turning cold and not well heated.  My family's young children were cranky due to the long wait.

Such service do not deserve any service charges nor surcharge.  If only, the surcharge was clearly communicated in the menu, we may have picked another restaurant instead of this.  Thus, this is clearly a mis-interpretation of their cost.

I tried speaking to their so-call boss, but sadly he said he can't do anything.  However, when i ask why this is not indicated clearly in the menu, he mentioned that this is their usual charge and that there is a notice on that day of the dinner which placed outside the door.  Isn't this not ethnical as customers are probably only aware when they are there.

Hope this can inform all about their restaurant CNY standard with underlining conditions that are not clearly stated on their menu cost.  Please be wary. I am taking this up with CASE now.  Hope they can provide us with a fair resolution.",2025-02-09T01:53:50.485Z,food and beverages

SZ Kitchen @ Joo Koon,5,"SZ Kitchen at Joo Koon is a great spot for comforting zi char favourites, and two dishes stand out for me: the hor fun and the milky fish soup. The hor fun comes with smooth, tender noodles drenched in a rich, savoury gravy. What makes it special is the wok hei – that smoky, charred aroma that lingers with every bite, proof that the chef knows how to work the fire. It’s the kind of dish you crave on a rainy evening. On the other hand, the milky fish soup is hearty in a different way. The broth is creamy yet light, with a natural sweetness that blends beautifully with the fresh, firm slices of fish. It warms you up instantly, offering comfort without being cloying. Paired together, these two dishes show off SZ Kitchen’s ability to deliver both wok-fired boldness and homely, soul-soothing flavours.

Ordered 1 set for my breakfast, and I'm hooked, wonton is meaty and well marinated with a good size diameter to boot, mostly we get wonton with more skin then meat filling, but this is the real deal, it comes with a bit of prawn meat and chives incorporated into it.

The noodle is springy and doesn't bloat up when you order it as takeaway.

As such my default order will be a plate of wonton noodle + a bowl of wonton soup, muahahaha, eat till my heart's content.

Recently we also tried their port rib version, it is soft and well marinated also, do give it a go also, either ask them to add on top of your wonton noodle order or just order pork rib ver itself.",2023-09-04T02:35:51.522Z,food and beverages

Prawn paste chicken super popular with the kids and adults. Salted egg and buttercream prawns both yummy. Sambal kangkong not bad, but not the very spicy kind. Ginger onion beef is so-so. Prices are higher than food court but quality is closer to places in shopping malls so we don't mind the price! Not very crowded even on weekends which is a bonus.

Free parking on weekdays lunch, plenty of parking space.

They serve different Daily Special Menu, it is always something to look forward to.

Ok, price is on the higher side, maybe even slightly more ex than foodcourt price. A meal with a drink could cost around from 7 to 10 bucks.

But their food really got standard, taste good and portion is reasonably big.

Bottle tree cafe restaurant by sembawang eating house seafood restaurant,1,"TLDR: AVOID holiday or when there is a crowd if possible as the system to collect the food is FLAWED.

After ordering 4 mains from the self ordering kiosk, my family sat down and waited. The system calling the order was found to be based NOT in order of Q number. Worse, one staff has to key in the Q number based on whichever dish is cooked and handed to him.

Something was amiss after 30 mins and we found our Q number not being called while Q number after ours were called.

It was observed a lot of people waiting at the counter and I noticed dishes which we ordered were taken away. It occurred to me that people were not waiting for the Q number and simply taking the dishes on their own. I was pretty sure as I saw the Q number of the receipt from the people taking the food was many numbers after ours.

After waiting closed to 50 minutes, we gave up and asked for the refund.",2022-08-09T09:21:52.129Z,food and beverages

The Crowded Bowl,1,"Really disappointed with my recent visits. The service staff literally count out the ingredients, exactly 5 pieces of each item, like they’re rationing food. Prices have gone up but the portions have shrunk, and it’s nowhere near as filling compared to just a year ago. If you’re going to call yourself Crowded Bowl, at least make sure the bowl actually feels crowded. Right now it’s the opposite. Service attitude also leaves much to be desired.

The Crowded Bowl,1,"Food is good, but experience got drastically affected by the rude service staffs. I fundamentally believe if you don't like your job you should either quit or do something about it and not vent it on the business's customers. Either the owners is oblivious to the situation or the staffs are putting up a front.

Staff wasnt patient at all when we asked about the ingredients displayed as there were no descriptions and it's our virgin visit. Asked for napkins if possible upon checkout and all 3 front staff quickly jumped on aggressively to say don't have, saw tissues at the cashier counter and asked if I could have one if not I could buy it and they said that's kitchen towels and not tissues so no. After seating down heard the staff complaining among themselves of how they haven't had their off days. I guess they are overwhelmed as they were are seating inside the counter on a toilet stool when we walked in. The place was empty tho with only 1 table of 2pax.

Food was good and super value for money as recommended by a fellow alumni. I personally feel it's underpriced for the quality.

To the owners I hope you're seeing this as you have a great business given your NTU story, and it will be a waste if you lose customers over stupid unnecessary things like this. Super great fast service business model with exceptional prices and the last key to the lock is to have basic decent human to human respect from the service staffs.

The vegetables taste fresh. The lettuce is just romain so nothing too substantial. The rice is a bit oily.
The tofu was good but there wasn’t much of it added.
You choose a few sides and a main. The base is salad and rice or pasta. I think that’s how it works…
No credit but they take cash.

The Crowded Bowl,5,"The food was fulfilling and tasty. Their portion sizes are perfect for me, I can eat a normal cai fan 3 ingredients and feel satisfied so their normal bowl is just enough. My favourite ingredients are the mock fish, corn and one other veggie or meat depending on what I feel like. I'm not going to dock points, but there are some ingredients I feel are pretty rough and just don't fit in terms of flavour and texture, like the fishcake looking tofu has a grainy feel and is almost flavourless. Other than that, choose between savoury or sweet and sour sauces to complete your bowl. Oh, and their scrambled egg is top notch, extremely creamy, soft and fluffy if you're an egg fan.

I dined in, and the experience was OK. Not too cold or hot, sometimes I guess one or two flies will make their way in due to the lack of a strong air-conditioning curtain? So one star off.

Today afternoon (21-09-2024), I bought Meal with Mutton Intestine and chicken fry parcel, total cost $10.50 they charged, when i reach and ate the mutton totally no salt... really very sad, you people are charged so much but even your never taste it before serve to customer, it does not cheap!!!

when you're in hungry, if totally no salt in the food how you going to eat ????? ridiculers. it's about $10.50.

My strong recommendation to everyone, don't take parcel from this place.  if you want to eat just eat there. stupid people never taste before serving, and also charging too expensive...

The food is very flavourful, with the peking duck being tender and crispy, and the tempura being extra crispy. absolutely amazing tonight on 10 August.

Raw items is quite limited as well. Shouldn’t named fishballs, more like dough balls. Soup base is ok but ain’t fantastic, your mouth gets very dry afterwards likely due to high in MSG. But comparing to the halal hotpot restaurant I been to it’s slightly above average.",2025-04-18T13:03:52.937Z,food and beverages

Mother Earth Vegetarian Restaurant 大地之素,1,"Firstly, I didn’t expect a restaurant where you have to take your own plates and utensils, and even wipe your own table. If I could give a rating lower than zero, I’d give it -100. What kind of logic is this—calling it a restaurant but making it self-service?

And to top it off, they still had the nerve to add a 20% surcharge for CNY Eve. Understand that is CNY charges but come on such services trash.

Worst experience ever, Honestly, should I even pay that when everything is self-service?

There was a moment when all of our dishes had been cleared, but the new ones hadn’t arrived yet. When they finally brought the new dishes, they just stood there holding them, waiting for us to clear the space ourselves?

Even if it’s self-service, they could’ve informed us about it beforehand, not after the dishes arrive, when we have to walk over and ask. It’s basic customer service to let your guests know in advance, and that’s something any restaurant or service crew should do.

Don’t use excuses like “too many people” or “lack of staff” – that’s not the customer’s issue, it’s the restaurant’s. Don’t shift your problems onto the customers.

The food is fine , table is comfy, the price for the dish size is valuable but the service is horrible. I used to be in the FnB industrial for more than 5 years and have been to some different restaurants, food central…and I’ve never ever seen any other place in Singapore have this kind of service staffs. Over 4,5 staffs we often see around the floor and none of them able to greet customers properly, serve food to customers just bring to the table and place it on, even when they clear the empty plates they can’t even greet or ask for permission if we wish to have it clear, they come and go just silent like the robot. They serve the drinks: a bottle of beer without open it for customers just leave the opener on the table. Must be fair previous times they got open and leave the bottle on the table…🙁. I wish i can meet the manager or the owner and tell them if you really put intention to build this business then please at least train your staffs. Can’t expect for perfect service but at least basic service customer should require. when i type these words I don’t want to bring hate or make you less customers but i hope you will do something different and make it become a great place. ☹️☹️☹️☹️",2025-01-07T12:00:22.154Z,food and beverages
JING RAN RESTAURANT 第二家园餐馆,5,"Would recommend!

Tried a variety of dishes for dinner. They have a good spread of options, and the flavours striking in a way that speaks to their authenticity while being affordable.

Their dishes were great. The standout was the steamed sea bass, the fish was fresh, the texture was delicate but robust. Their vegetables were well seasoned, with stir fried beans crisp and flavourful. The egg and tomato was a simple dish but was no less satisfying.

Their food also did not shy away in the spice area, with the heat making a balanced roundness to the dishes without being overpowering. For those not well acquainted with spice, I’m sure they are amenable to requests to taper the kick. Though I do recommend it for the experience.

Service was prompt and attentive, complementing the dishes served. Would come again. They also have private rooms with KTV systems.",2025-01-01T10:58:59.994Z,food and beverages

Reason was menu price not right. What they charge is right 👏

And they don’t cook based on first come first serve. They serve people who dine in first. Then cook for takeaway. Waited 35 min for 1 frog and 1 rice 🤡

Service: Although we are given a buzzer, a lady still served my order to where I'm seated, great service here and I didn't expect that.

Atmosphere: Take a look at the photos I took. Very clearly, the owners put in a lot of efforts in the aesthetics of the restaurant.

If you are at this area, don't miss this place. Highly recommended",2024-06-25T05:09:42.590Z,food and beverages

Service is meh, but the food is horrible! Ordered fish soup noodles and the amount of veggies was pathetic. The worst was the fish! The slices of fish were extremely CHEWY and SOUR!

McDonald's,1,"Horrible outlet with rude staff. Very disorganised. The queue numbers on the screen are only there for show.

I ordered my food, stood in front of the counter, and watched the staff preparing lots of mobile orders. I saw my order number under “Now Preparing” on the queue screen so I waited. Then it disappeared. It was not under “Serving”, and no one had called my number (which I do not even understand since isn’t the point of the screen is so no numbers need to be called)?

So I approached this male staff at the counter and asked if my order was ready since the number was not on the screen. He glanced at my receipt and said rudely and sarcastically, “Ma’am please wait it has only been 3 minutes”. Even had the cheek to glare. I tried telling him that I ONLY asked because my number had disappeared from the screen and he replied loudly and impatiently, “I will call the number when it is ready” - as if I am supposed to be familiar with their messed up system. So much for the screen alert advising you to “Please watch here for your number”.

The patty on the cheeseburger was too salty, and the ice in my drink was already half melted.

Based on the reviews I’ve seen here, McDonald’s should do something about the staff and system at this outlet.",2024-03-15T22:37:51.086Z,food and beverages

McDonald's,1,"Advice for those who want fast orders from this place:

Just do Pick Up orders, for some reason they just like to prioritize orders that are pick up rather than dine in options.

Also don’t do any coupon redemptions from this place. They like to always push those orders to the back of the queue. And they also like to screw up the coupon redemption orders as well.

Unless you want to wait for 1+ hours (legit if I haven’t asked for a refund I would probably be waiting till lunch hours), just follow these steps.

Or do mobile orders, they sure love to do mobile orders as there are always 10+ mobile orders done already but left on the counter for like 30+ mins.",2024-03-11T02:32:00.596Z,food and beverages
McDonald's,1,"Ordered a dine-in meal at 1726 on 19 Feb. I waited in the queue all the way till 1756. I tried asking the manager(an Indian lady) where my order was, reasoning with her that orders from 1743 and before were already being served. The manager did not bother looking at the receipt and brushed me off, saying it's an automated system, and if I can't wait, she's more than willing to refund. Really bad response, worsened by what follows:
5 minutes later, another employee noticed that I've been there for quite some time and took a look at my receipt. She noticed something was very wrong and went back to the manager, who said she had already served the order since at 1730-something. Turns out they decided to serve dine-in orders in takeaway bags.

I don't think that's a standard practice? They could at least put a sign saying they are doing so. Hope the management can better train their staff to follow procedures properly, and at least try to understand the situation before dismissing or borderline threatening customers with a refund for something that's their fault to begin with.",2024-02-20T16:42:18.893Z,food and beverages

McDonald's,1,"I’d like to express my disappointment regarding my experience at your Joo Koon outlet. This morning, I ordered the Big Breakfast set and requested for butter, something that has traditionally accompanied the meal. However, despite asking multiple times, the staff firmly insisted that butter is now chargeable.

This may seem like a small issue, but it had a surprisingly big impact on what should have been a simple, happy weekend breakfast. Being denied a basic condiment that was previously complimentary and is reasonably expected as part of a “Big Breakfast” came across as unnecessarily petty and profit-driven.

McDonald’s has long been known in Singapore as a family-friendly restaurant that values customer satisfaction. If this is a shift in policy, I urge you to reconsider. Charging for something as basic as butter without informing customers in advance feels misaligned with the brand values many of us grew up with.

While I understand rising costs and operational decisions, these changes shouldn’t come at the cost of basic customer experience. A little butter should be part of the service, not an upsell!

I hope this feedback is taken seriously, as this seemingly small policy change significantly affected my overall impression of McDonald’s today.",2025-08-03T03:43:22.739Z,food and beverages

"SUBWAY @ FairPrice Hub, Joo Koon Circle",1,"Tried the Daily Sub for the first time at this Subway outlet and was quite disappointed compared to other branches. Only two bread options were available—white and wheat—while other outlets typically offer the full selection. The sandwich preparation felt rushed and lacked care; vegetables were placed rather messily, portions were noticeably small unless specifically asked for more, and there was no lettuce in stock at all. Although the bread was put into the oven, it came out cold along with the cheese, suggesting the oven may not have been properly heated. The overall impression was that the server lacked proper training and passion in food preparation, which unfortunately affected the entire dining experience.",2025-07-23T04:08:55.841Z,food and beverages

Popeyes Fairprice Hub,2,"While acknowledging the challenges within the Food & Beverage sector, we must address the feedback regarding the quality of the beverages (Bandung fizzy pop) and mashed potatoes, which require improvement. The current offerings differ significantly from the standards established during Popeye's initial operations in Singapore. Furthermore, the chicken's dryness is a concern. Given the increasing cost of the chicken set, we expect a satisfying and well-prepared meal. We request that this review be given serious consideration, particularly for the Joo Koon Popeye outlet.",2025-08-02T11:45:50.603Z,food and beverages

I’ve attached some photos to show what happened. It’s a small injury, but it was painful and completely avoidable.

I hope Popeyes will look into the quality of their utensils — this could have been worse for someone else. Please improve this.

I’m giving 1 star for this visit because while the food was okay, the injury caused by the plastic spoon really ruined the experience. I hope this is addressed seriously.",2025-06-24T11:44:23.134Z,food and beverages

Captain's Table,5,"1st time we are at this restaurant with 2 table booked (22 pax) one week in advance.
Making use of their NDP 95 promo that came in a set comprising Seabass, prawn & spring chicken@$95/set.
We also order peking duck,
fishmaw crab soup, coffee pork ribs, tofu shimeji,redbean pancake,hot yam paste,mango pomelo, heineken, steam rice,coke,chinese tea,braised peanuts.
I am so glad my family enjoyed all the food so much as it were everybody 1st  despite some delayed at the last minute where more diners started to walk-in. The manager offers his apologise & fill our 2 tables with complimentary food which we really appreciated.
I must said:
the steam prawn is exceptionally fresh & nice, the fried seabass is so flavorful, chicken is so yummy & juicy, tofu is crisp & soft, fishmaw is thick with ingredients,
a ""WOW"" to the pancake,
yam paste is thick with gingko nuts, ribs is tender & crisp.
Peking duck come with 2 combi flavour that need to order in advance.
I am not a noodle person but the remaining duckmeat fried with noodle caught me by surprise. Light & refreshing.
As most member of the family are taught to cook when we were young we find all the food are flavourful, not salty nor sweet. We had a bountiful stomach after having our meal. Everybody said affordable & worth.
Menu & price can be located in the website.
Thanks to the manager & his dedicated staff were serving us well.

Nice atmosphere, excellent services",2025-07-05T15:07:43.434Z,food and beverages
Captain's Table,5,"disclaimer: they’re a little understaffed, so service and food may be slower for this place. I don’t mind as I like to take my time with food!

Wonderful place to have dinner at - the sunset views are stunning at the correct hour.

Fish maw soup: Very balanced. Just the right saltiness and texture. Have a little sip first before adding in (just a little bit of!) vinegar and pepper to taste the difference.

Stir fried scallops with asparagus in truffle: interestingly good! In many dishes I’ve had, the truffle taste is stronger (and after a while it gets overpowering), but in this dish it was just a hint - a really delicate highlight to compliment the dish as a whole. Asparagus texture was just right - easy to chew but not too crunchy.

Stir fried kurobuta (black pork) in black pepper sauce: very tender!

Peking duck: must order in advance! Make a reservation and order in advance due to the preparation the kitchen must make prior to the meal. I really love the “pastry” they use to wrap the skin for the meal, it’s thin and fragrant. They’ll serve it half with cucumber and half with spring onion. For the second round, you can choose to have it one out of several ways (if I remember correctly : fried rice, stir fried with e-mian, salt and pepper stir fried, ginger/garlic and onion stir fry, or just chopped up and served).

Mango and pomelo was nice and fragrant, not too thick but also not too watery.

Deep fried Red bean pancake: MUST ORDER. Can’t stress this enough; this was actually so good. Exterior was wonderfully crispy without being too oily, and the red bean paste in the middle was fragrant and delicious. Got a “not too sweet” of approval from family members! (ps: you should probably order this dessert slightly ahead of time, not at the end of the meal but maybe before your second last or last dish arrives since it takes time to prepare by hand.)

Star of the whole meal was service staff Simon, who also did the table side Peking duck serving. Very charismatic and charming. Will definitely come back again!

Total was around 300+ for 5 people.

Captain's Table,1,"Was here with friends at Raffles Marina's Captain Table Chinese Restaurant on 19 June during lunch. We informed the staff we had time constraints due to work commitments. Despite that, our food was delayed, and we weren’t even the first to be served, though we ordered earlier.

What shocked me most was the attitude of the floor manager, Henry. His tone was aggressive and he glared at us like he was picking a fight. Totally unacceptable behaviour. We weren’t rude — just asked about our food delay — but were met with zero professionalism and this kind of gangster-style response. Very disappointed and will never return.",2025-06-25T07:09:37.546Z,food and beverages
Captain's Table,5,"Absolutely outstanding experience at The Captain’s Table! Every dish was a delight, and the service was top-notch.

We started with the Fish Maw Soup—rich, flavorful, and comforting. The Steamed Fish was perfectly cooked, fresh and tender, with a light, fragrant sauce. The Roast Chicken was juicy with crispy skin and a hint of spice—so satisfying!

The Prawns and Scallops were incredibly fresh and cooked just right, while the Mushrooms with Sea Cucumber brought a luxurious, umami-rich depth to the meal.

To end on a sweet note, the Mango Puree with Pomelo and Sago was refreshing and not overly sweet—absolutely perfect.

What really stood out was the attentive and professional service. The staff were friendly, prompt, and thoughtful throughout the entire evening. Every detail was taken care of.

Greenhouse Bistro,4,"This is probably one of the most westerly restaurants (the other being the one at Raffles Marina near the second link) in Singapore. Located in Tuas West, this restaurant is located in a 'ulu' industrial flat, amongst factories and industrial buildings.
The Place:
The hugh dining hall was decorated with many posters of food and LED wordings on the walls, which, together with the plastic plants, seem somewhat crowded and tacky. The bar counter was too crowded with equipments and utensils, and was overshadowed by the large posters hanging over it. The decor could improve with a better interior designer.
The Food
I had the truffles olio aglio pasta with New Zealand ribeye. The pasta was perfectly cooked, with a nice degree of al-dente. The truffles oil add a hint of umami to the olive oil-based sauce, without overpowering it. The ribeye was a bit tough, probably due to the lack of marbling of the New Zealand steak, but was well cooked and not dry, attesting to the skill and care of the chef. The addition of black cavier on the steak, although did not add to the flavour, however did enhance the presentation of the dish. The restaurant was having a promotion of Japanese oysters - $1 for each raw oyster. The plump oyster tasted full of briny freshness, and was creamy in textual.
Conclusion
It is worth a visit if you are around the area.",2025-03-05T06:25:25.382Z,food and beverages

Tenderbest,1,"Extremely disappointing experience at Tenderbest. The service was appalling from start to finish. The cashier was curt and dismissive, showing zero interest in engaging respectfully with customers. Staff behind the counter were equally indifferent, with no sense of urgency or basic courtesy.

To make matters worse, the food was served carelessly — portions were sloppily thrown together with no regard for presentation or hygiene. This is not what I expect from a brand that positions itself as a reputable F&B establishment.

What truly added insult to injury was the payment process. A QR code for online payment was clearly displayed, yet when I attempted to use it, I was abruptly told it was cash only. No signage, no warning — just a blunt refusal and poor attitude. This kind of miscommunication reflects very poorly on the management. It’s 2025 — cash-only operations without proper notice are unacceptable.

This outlet needs serious retraining on customer service, basic professionalism, and operational clarity. Until then, I won’t be returning — and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone expecting a minimally decent dining experience.",2025-06-04T05:31:50.927Z,food and beverages

Tenderbest,1,"I was excited to try Tenderbest’s in hawker setup on April 2, 2025, but my experience was disappointing due to the cashier’s (women) attitude. When I placed my order, I mentioned I would pay via PayWave. She didn’t inform me that PayWave wasn’t available, so I stood there waiting for a terminal to tap my card. Instead of calmly explaining, she suddenly shouted at me, looking irritated, and pointed to the scan voucher option.

I didn’t even see the voucher scanner because I approached from the left side, and it was on the right. A simple explanation—like “We don’t accept PayWave, only PayNow or PayLah”—would have solved everything. Instead, she acted as if I had done something wrong. Even after I paid, she continued looking at me with an angry expression, which made me wonder why she was treating me like an enemy.

To make matters worse, when serving the food, she just tossed the plate down and said, “Chicken creamy pasta.” That was it—no courtesy, no service.

This was a very disappointing experience. The management should train their staff to be more approachable and customer-friendly.",2025-04-02T04:30:39.526Z,food and beverages

Tenderbest,5,"I don’t know why many people are hating on this store. But honestly I find the food quite nice, it’s acceptable but could be better.

I have tried tenderfresh @ Clementi and I could tell the halal standard (NEW) is better than this. I understand why is because this tenderbest store is using old equipment (eg. Fryer) and hence the fries look undercooked but still edible, I don’t blame them. Though it’s not hot but it’s still okay.

Chicken wise it’s like your typical hawker standard. It’s acceptable and I feel that I prefer this over the tenderfresh one because the tenderfresh appears more crisper than tenderbest.

The chili, garlic bread and the coleslaw taste very similar to tenderbest

It's not rocket science to know that such sub-standard customer service is not gonna help your business moving forward. Will be taking my business elsewhere until Tenderbest is able to re-train this female cashier.

From their menu, I decided to have lontong as it has been a long while since I last ate.

I was expecting the usual bland lontong, but was pleasantly surprised by their lontong.

The rice cake was nice and firm enough without it being too soft and lumpy.  The piece of tofu was fried nicely, soft inside but firm on the outside.

The lontong gravy was also very flavorful, and when mixed with their sambal, it turned out to be a very good combination.

Overall this would be amongst the top 3 lontongs that I have eaten in SG.

The rice was aromatic, perfectly cooked, and beautifully spiced — not too oily, just right. You can tell a lot of care and technique went into this dish. Even the sides like the chutney and dhal were spot on and complemented the meal perfectly. A must-try for any briyani lover.

Jia Jia Vegetarian,2,"The management should really do something about the queue system. Instead of asking the customers to ""自己来"" when it comes to adding the sambal chilli or green chilli, the staff could perhaps offer their help - perhaps consider placing the chilli inside and help the customers add before packing it?

Very often, they don't ask if pple would like chilli and straightaway they proceeded to closing the box / tying the plastic bag. Then, these customers have to struggle to reopen the dabao box just to add chilli, and usually this action often blocks those who are waiting in the line. The lack of space in front of the stall and the lack of a proper operations sysyem really make the whole experience unpleasant.

Idk. I really miss the previous vegetarian stall tenant helming this stall. It was a local family who ran the business and making sure their food and service were the best.

The current business is run by an organisation who employs non-locals, who are here to work, and lack the personal touch. Everything also ask their customers to ""自己来""，if not fast enough, they will even shout from the inside and rush them to hurry. I am speechless.",2025-05-18T03:00:51.611Z,food and beverages

Es el corazón de la cultura de los vendedores ambulantes, declarada por la UNESCO (*). Cuenta igualmente con una amplia gama de puestos y productos diversos en la planta baja, junto con un.mercado de mariscos y productos del dia en el sótano. También hay servicios públicos.

como el primer elemento

Representativa del Patrimonio
Cultural Inmaterial de la
Humanidad de la UNESCO el
16 de diciembre de 2020. EI
Comité Intergubernamental
dio su apoyo unánime a la
inscripción de la cultura
ambulante en Singapur...
Cultura de vendedores ambulantes en Singapur: la comida comunitaria y las prácticas culinarias en un contexto urbano multicultural están.presentes en todo Singapur. Los vendedores ambulantes preparan una variedad de comida (xcomida de ambulante》) para quienes cenan y conviven en los centros de venta ambulante. Estos centros funcionan como 《comedores comunitarios》 donde personas de diversos orígenes se reúnen y comparten la experiencia de comer durante el desayuno, el almuerzo y la cena. También se realizan actividades como partidas de ajedrez, actuaciones callejeras y sesiones de improvisación artistica.
Evolucionados a partir de la cultura de la comida callejera, los centros de venta ambulante se han convertido en un símbolo de Singapur como ciudad-estado multicultural, que abarca las culturas china, malaya, india y otras. Los vendedores ambulantes se inspiran en la confluencia de estas culturas, adaptando los platos a los gustos y contextos locales. Hoy en día, los centros de venta ambulante en todo Singapur continúan atendiendo las necesidades de diversas comunidades en distritos
residenciales, recreativos y laborales. Algunos de los vendedores ambulantes más antiguos comenzaron su actividad en la década de 1960. Muchos se especializan en un plato en particular, perfeccionado a lo largo de los años, y transmiten sus recetas, conocimientos y habilidades a familiares más jóvenes o aprendices. Las organizaciones comunitarias, las organizaciones no gubernamentales y las instituciones educativas desempeñan un papel fundamental en la promoción y el mantenimiento de la cultura ambulante mediante programas de capacitación, eventos y proyectos de documentación. Como espacio social que acoge a personas de diversos origenes socioeconómicos, los centros ambulantes desempeñan un papel crucial en la mejora de las
interacciones comunitarias y el fortalecimiento del tejido social.

Chinatown Complex,5,"We ate at the CTC a few times during our trip to Singapore in June 2025. We enjoyed all the food we ate at all the stalls we tried. One that stood out for us was Hainanese Chicken stall #02-176. The stall does very good BBQ Pork and Char Seiw.

The flavour was good. You could taste all the subtle herbs and spices of the char seiw. The prices were very reasonable ($4SG-$5SG) and the serving size was generous. Not so big that you couldn’t try other dishes.

The very nice owner was happy to have a chat.",2025-07-14T01:36:38.933Z,food and beverages
Chinatown Complex,5,"The hawker stalls on the upper floor of the centre are some of the best in the city. While not as finely polished as Lau Pa Sat, the Chinatown complex hawker centre has a great selection of food that would suit families and backpackers in a tight budget.
We were able to get a selection of foods to suit ourselves and the kids, plus a cheeky beer or two, and leave plenty of change for dessert.
Most places only accept cash, and bring some small change to use the toilets (10c) or use toilet paper (20c)

Chinatown Complex,4,"I'm not sure why Google has this place as just a hawker centre, because Chinatown Complex is more than a hawker centre - housing a wet market at its basement level and a sundries market at its first floor; with the hawker centre at its second floor. Maybe it's because the hawker centre here is (apparently) the largest in Singapore with 226 stalls thereat albeit some of them not taken up when I was there today. Anyway, Chinatown Complex draws a lot of locals and tourists to its building and is a IMO historical icon in Chinatown. That said, the place may appear dingy to some, but heck, it's historical - and apparently, it's up for some refurbishment or more than that in 2026. The hawker centre is mostly serving Chinese or local Chinese cuisines with few or no other cuisines on offer. Well, it is Chinatown isn't it.",2025-07-02T07:57:16.480Z,food and beverages
Chinatown Complex,4,"One of the must visit hawker centre at Chinatown for authentic local food and more.
Famous Chicken rice, all sorts noodle dishes, rice dishes, porridge, roast meat, good local coffee, the stall with the long line (1950's). And some halal stalls.

Plenty of choices and the food complex is huge with  plenty of seating areas.
Explore the whole place, some good stalls are quite hidden.
Few stalls are Michelin Gourmand recommended
Average $10 per person will fill you up.

First of all, the portion is really generous! I'm a big eater and I find it's enough for me. It's the most special Mee Hoon Kueh as the shape and is similar to Ravioli but with a better texture. It absorbs the gravy evenly and hence it taste better. Mee Hoon Kueh and noodles are hand made daily by owner too. Fried fish coated with a very thin batter too with good amount of fish. Fish soup makes me think of home cooked soup without the usual MSG. Highly recommended if you're near that area.",2020-08-12T08:04:25.926Z,food and beverages

I got my hands on their basic salad bowl.
They’re generous with the sauces. I love how their salad ordering sheet is categorised, so you can choose the veggies and flavours going into your bowl.

They ran out of roasted sweet potato pretty quickly. So I swapped it with potato instead.
I feel it’s a lil too salty for me. But if your salt tolerance is high, you won’t feel it.

Starbucks,3,"I had a very unpleasant experience at this Starbucks today.
The female staff member at the counter was clearly impatient from the start. When I didn’t catch her question about cup size, she rudely pointed at the menu and rolled her eyes, which felt completely unnecessary and disrespectful.

Later, when she asked “take it away?” (which she said too quickly for me to understand), I asked her to repeat, and she stared at me again before slowing down. Her attitude was cold and condescending throughout the interaction.

To make it easier, I had even prepared a screenshot showing exactly what I wanted — drink type, cup size, sugar level — and specifically asked for just one pump of syrup, but the drink I received did not match my request at all.

There was no queue behind me, no pressure or rush. Still, I was treated like I was causing a problem just for not catching her words the first time.

I always try to be respectful when ordering, and I understand that service work can be tiring — but basic courtesy is the minimum. I felt very uncomfortable and disappointed. I will not return to this store.",2025-08-14T08:02:34.561Z,food and beverages

Also got the latest cocoa golden monkey (U.P. $8.30) which is tea latte meets choc chip macchiato. The tea taste not that strong or lingering in the mouth as my tea-loving self would have liked, but a really soothing drink overall.

Would have wished the cafe could expand to be the size of their NUS branch as there’s few charging spots in this one and fewer seats, so it’s on a lucky chance if you can get a few seats to sit with friends.",2021-04-26T09:48:23.829Z,food and beverages

Nasi Padang stall sell good food. Nasi Sambal Goreng (Beef) ($6.50) is a flavourful, authentic dish featuring steamy white rice, crunchy sambal goreng, soft bergedil, and rich, creamy rendang daging. Complemented by chewy paru goreng, sweet-savoury serunding, and a sweet-spicy sambal, it delivers a satisfying mix of textures and flavours.

Hearty, slurpy You Mian from noodle stall at just $4—chewy noodles in savoury broth with marinated meats, veg, and egg. Simple, soulful comfort.

Assam Curry Fish ($6) from claypot stall very spicy, oily but shiok! Thick gravy kind not the watery tamarind kind. More like indian style curry. Got egg plant, okra, herbs and spice inside. Come with a bowl of white rice. The spiciness will make you sweat and beg for water.",2025-07-28T13:27:23.010Z,food and beverages

Wan Soon Lai Bakuteh & Fried Porridge,5,"Unfortunately, there aren't that many fried porridge outlets in Singapore. Plenty of Teochew, Cantonese, Taiwan congee, frog porridge etc, but precious few that actually serve fried porridge.

Apparently originating from Malaysia, the ingredients are first stir fried in a wok under high heat before adding the porridge base. When done correctly, the wok hei aroma permeates throughout the porridge, adding an extra dimension to a dish that for many represents the epitome of comfort food.

My favorite example of this porridge however doesn't even make it to Google's list of fried porridge in Singapore (again, you get plenty of porridge that isn't actually fried). Add to that, WSL is located in an industrial area not easily accessible by public transport (the nearest MRT being Joo Koon which is a 15 min walk away).

You don't have to worry about eating cold porridge here. The thick flavorful porridge is served piping hot in a claypot that takes a long while to cool down. Even at $6 it still represents fair value given how generous they were with ingredients. They keystone of this dish however,  is the wok hei and it's front and centre in WSL's porridge. Honestly, worth the trek out into the industrial heartland for this simple dish!",2025-08-14T14:26:21.469Z,food and beverages

DLLM LOKLOK,5,"Finally back at @dllm.sg , but this time, at their Jurong outlet. It’s been awhile since I went to the Kallang outlet, but my impression was that they had more ingredients at that outlet 🤔 In my opinion, this was a very shiok supper and remains one of the better lok lok shops in Singapore. Recommend!

June’s Breathe Cafe,5,"Love this space and the food. Usually I’ll go for the brown rice with dishes. I like veggies and there’re plenty of options. For meat lovers, there’re also meat dishes. It can get crowded during term time but during term breaks, it’s the perfect place to meet friends and just chill. There’re pastries too and the Nanyang coffee is to die for. 💕",2025-06-05T01:09:32.306Z,food and beverages
June’s Breathe Cafe,4,"Nice atmosphere for lunch as the cafe is open concept with many natural lighting. Very clean feeling unlike other canteens in NTU (ESPECIALLY QUAD)…. Food wise taste average like your salad bowl and a little pricey for portion. Good for eating there, if take away, can consider other places.",2025-05-20T05:55:17.544Z,food and beverages

June’s Breathe Cafe,4,"One pretty quaint lunch spot away from the more well-trafficked places in NTU campus, owned by a cheery middle aged couple. It's located in a concourse of the Experimental Medicine Building (third floor), accessible from the main North Spine complex from an overhead bridge.

Price is a bit more steep than in the cafeterias and they focus more on quality rather than portion size - perfect for dieting staffs and students. The menu is large - from pastries, sandwiches, cakes, wraps, cut fruits, coffee, and most importantly rice/pasta bowl with customizable topping (choices of meat, tofu, vegs). The pastries are served warm and fresh, and the bowl dishes' toppings are tasty. The coffee (espresso-based) is surprisingly pretty good and rather well-priced.

Can confirm sometimes there aren't enough seating during peak lunch time, albeit being situated inside a spacious concourse. More seating could be added so the customers can unwind.",2025-02-22T15:03:34.865Z,food and beverages
June’s Breathe Cafe,4,"It’s good and they’re realllyyy nice. But it’s expensive and the portion isn’t very big. $6.50 for a bowl (with chicken or tofu) and 3 toppings. They have brown rice which I really liked! But it’s not too much food.

The auntie tries her best to up sell you too much until it feels really hard sell.

What stood out the most is that you're rushed out post-meal, even when the cafe is empty, with the auntie's stern reminder to everyone while at the table '吃了就要离开' ('Once you've eaten, you must leave'). Ironic for a place named for a deep breath, you aren't allowed to catch one.",2023-10-25T15:01:13.697Z,food and beverages

Al dente spaghetti with 3 bouncy prawn, 3 clams & 3 soft chewy sotong ring. Everything is fine, the spiciness level is appropriate, the Tom Yum flavour is barely acceptable and a tad bit salty. But I feel it lacks some authenticness in it.

Is there a way to, perhaps, ensure that people using the tables in the area are there to actually have their meals, especially during lunch hour? I notice that there’re a lot of students here studying, using their laptops, having group discussions without ordering food DURING lunch hours.

Lu Heng Kee 盧興記 Hokkien Mee,5,"We steadily decided to visit this very old time HKM stall. We visit around 11am and there's not much queue but after that the queue started to boom!!

We share a plate of $5. It's super duper wet style hkm but if you look closely the gravy was ultra thick & very brownish. A little let down at first as there's no squid nor pork slices. Just prawns, but just one mouthful I understand it's ok without them. And the fresh and crispy pork lard and 2 pcs of abalone more than made up for it.

I think they are very focused on the prawn stock. It's heavenly good, very prawny & unami taste. Noodles were well cooked, portions great and there's really nice wok hei. Every mouthful goes perfect. Worth our long trip there.

We will be back!!

There are hints of wok hei, but the broth does not have strong umami taste. Not sure why the prawns are a mixed of whole abd and halves, i prefer the whole prawn.

Lu Heng Kee 盧興記 Hokkien Mee,5,"This is a well hidden gem of Fried Hokkien Prawn Noodles in Jurong West St 92. Long queues can be expected and they close by 1pm.

Servings are huge. Prices start at $5 for the small portion and $7 for the largest. For those with smaller appetites, the small portion is surely adequate for lunch.

Ordered the medium portion for $6. The noodles are fried in batches which explains the long queues. The Hokkien Mee here really conforms to my preference for wet, soupy type. Literally you can drink the left over broth. There is also ample wok heat and with the medium portion you get three shrimps, shell off tails on. The other major difference from other fried Hokkien Mee is that this stall does not use pork belly or squids. Instead they give you mock abalone which adds to the flavours of the noodles.

Speaking of flavours, my first mouthful imparted the Wow! factor. Coupled with the chilli sauce which packs quite the punch, the plate was slurped up within 10 mins, in spite of its size. Really didn’t regret ordering the medium portion.

Lu Heng Kee 盧興記 Hokkien Mee,5,"HKM is prepared in cauldron size so it may take a while if you are in line for a new batch.

The largest order was $7 which came with 4 mid sized prawns and mock abalone. No squid or pork.

It was very moist, almost soupy. The broth is of pork bone and crustacean base, offering deep flavor. Egg wash gave it another depth. A good mix of yellow noodle and white vermicelli.

A squeeze of lime uplifted the dish. Lard was large and crisp while the chili was potent and went well with the overall dish.

Almost 80% of the tables were having this dish. A great find in a far flung corner.",2024-09-24T06:50:47.337Z,food and beverages

Lu Heng Kee 盧興記 Hokkien Mee,5,"This hokkien mee would probably raise many red flags for hokkien mee lovers:

Thick bee hoon. Red flag.
Whole wok of pre-fried, ready-to-serve noodles sitting in the wok waiting for customers. Red flag
1 min of preparation time from order to serve. Red flag
Super wet version, noodles swimming in broth. Red flag.

In fact, the noodles were served to me before I could even get to the paynow confirmed payment page to show that I have paid. I was stopped from walking away to order my drinks after I have ordered, because my order was ready already. She merely scooped a huge ladle out of the ready wok for my $7 large order. Super red flag.

But all these red flags fell immediately upon my first sip of the broth. What in the world did they put into it? The crustaceans, wok hei, pork lard, seasonings, and the sambal belachan formed a formidable coalition force that penetrated deep into my taste buds. The full flavour was out of this world.

Mind you, the pork lard were not some fried pieces of pork fat lying around in a container. They were scooped out of bowl of pork oil, and it managed to retain its crispiness, and some. Similar to that used in bak chor mee, those dry pieces of mass-fried pork lard provided elsewhere, free-flow or not, cannot hold a candle to those served here.

The only gripe I have is that the noodles were a little soggy, probably owing to the fact that they have been sitting in the wok for a while, waiting for me. Sorry, I was late.

It is a huge pity that this stall closes so early in the day. In the parallel universe where you are situated in the east and closes only at night, you are crowned king of hokkien mee. Swee Guan bows down to you.",2024-05-30T16:45:01.948Z,food and beverages

NTU Canteen 4,2,"Futuristic but not modern, probably the only place in the world to fit this description. The environment, though newly renovated, still gives off rather rustic vibes.
This canteen excels in long term forecasting inflation. They priced their dishes so far into the future, you need at least two decades for other canteens to keep up.
The same combination of dishes for mixed vegetable rice will cost $6.40 in other canteens. Over here, it’ll cost a whopping $7.80. It’s not like a famous tire company gave them a star either (if they did then pls take it away, it’s trash tier quality).
I believe part of their rationale behind the premium pricing is the Italian inspiration behind their food. In particular, their rice was hard enough to compete with those in a risotto.",2024-02-06T06:12:19.472Z,food and beverages

I believe it's the only place where you can get authentic jianbing in NTU campus, or even perhaps in the entire West. The jianbing isn't particularly the cheapest thing (above $4.5 per serving), but it comes with pretty large portion. Big enough for heavy breakfast (I can see why it's popular among college kids) or even lunch. Soft in the outside, crispy in the middle, and rather generous filling of meat and cabbage in the center.

I recommend people to go try it and I can guarantee you guys won't regret it.
Hidden in an industrial area.
Went on a Saturday late morning.
Not crowded at all!
Super nice uncle!
Super generous portion!
Super reasonably priced!
What else more can people expect?
Perfect!
Ordered a pig organ soup with white rice.
To my extremely pleasant surprise, uncle not only poured some braised sauce over my bowl of what's supposed to be just plain white rice, he also topped it up with a piece of his super flavourful tau pok!
And as if that wasn't pleasant enough, uncle even offered to top up my soup if needed!
I must say this.
This definitely is one of the nicest meals of my life!

Wide selection of pork dishes here like Bak Kut Teh, Pig’s Organ Soup, Pig’s Tail Soup, etc. They even have Salted Veg Duck Soup.
And at $4 a bowl, price is unbeatable.

And the taste is not too shabby too. We ordered Bak Kut Teh and Pig’s Organ Soup to share. The former was your quintessential peppery soup but it came with soft bone pork instead of prime ribs. The pig’s organ soup had more savoury and not peppery. There was stomach, liver, sliced pork, etc. We also ordered two bowls of rice. These came with a slab of braised Tau Pok on top and a ladle of braised sauce.

We always enjoy our cuppa with them, wherever they are -  Anthony the barista is a nice chat, pourovers are well extracted, they roast their own beans and they always offer an interesting variety.

Venture Drive Coffee,4,"Speciality coffee is a foreign thing in Singapore and thus due to the relatively low demand, coffee shops specializing on it are rare. I glad I found this coffee stand tucked near a foodcourt in NTU campus. Tried their drip coffee (forgot the beans' origin though) and it was very good and crafty - rich in floral notes in the beginning and became closer to nutty at the finish.

The pour over coffee was really expensive though (if I'm not mistaken, around $8). Definitely not the kind of thing that I can consume every day. Ended up buying their beans (Peru's Cafe del Valle, $22 for 100 gram) to brew it at home by myself.",2023-07-12T14:26:40.610Z,food and beverages

Connect71 Cafe,4,"Located a tad bit out of the way from the well-trafficked areas of NTU's North Spine and I've only known this place rather recently. Surprisingly popular among some students and staffs - there is always crowds around lunch time, perhaps the 10% discount of all items on sale for them is one of the main draws.

Discount aside, the offerings are actually pretty good given the price, albeit the Japanese and Japanese-inspired noodle dishes' portion is somewhat smaller than average for most people. The coffee is one of the very bests in NTU and very competitively priced ($3 for long black/espresso after discount). Don't expect the variety like real speciality coffee place like let's say Venture Drive, but they are know what they are doing - the coffee I've had was chocolaty, a bit velvety, and came with right 'body' and thickness.

Due to its popularity, the indoor space is very crowded in lunch time, but the outdoor dining space (next to a rooftop garden) is almost always empty. Some shading (even patio table with umbrella) would do, especially in hot weather.",2025-02-06T13:10:02.488Z,food and beverages

Connect71 Cafe,1,"Rating this purely for the chocolate cake sold here. DISCLAIMER I SAY FIRST EVERYTHING ELSE HERE IS GOOD, I JUST WANT TO REVIEW THE CHOCOLATE CAKE. Let’s start off with looks cos it was what intrigued me and my friend to want to buy it. We agreed that it looked like the cake from the Mr Bean TV animated series and the cake from Mathilda that Miss Trunchbull made Bruce eat. It sounds like we’re glazing it’s looks but that was rly what sold us to buying it. Was only $4 dollars and was splitting it two ways so each oni paid $2 so not the worst as well. Now here is where it went downhill and sent us into the five stages of grief.

Act 1, DENIAL: First taste right off the bat, did not rly like it but still tried to convince myself that it’s decent.
Act 2, ANGER: The more we ate it, the more we realised how unexcusably bland it was. The texture screamed industrial cleaning sponge that’s never met moisture, the irony. And we were in disbelief and anger that we let our glutton appetite be fooled by the cake’s looks and price. It’s like we could use this to scrub a toilet and the toilet would’ve probably apologised for the inconvenience.
Act 3, BARGAINING: As we ate the cake, our anger turned into a struggle to find meaning of this cake. Saying how even cheap/ affordable cake stores like polar and primadeli can do a better job, cos their chocolate cakes actually have the taste of cocoa which doesn’t seem like a hard requirement. Calling it a chocolate cake might have been a big slap to the face of cocoa farmers worldwide.
Act 4, DEPRESSION: Reaching the end of the cake, we started to wallow in our thoughts and in our seats. Bloated from the amount of water we needed to drink to mask the weird aftertaste in our mouths after every bite. Saying, I miss how my mouth tasted before eating this.
Act 5, ACCEPTANCE: Finally finishing the cake, we left the place, with Phlegmy throats induced due to the dryness and weird texture of the cake. Accepting what we had eaten and there’s nothing we can do about it. So moving forward, we will not be ordering this cake anymore. BUT, we will still be coming back to eat the other food like the mains and the drinks, those are super solid 4/5. Staff are also rly friendly 5/5.

Unfortunately, I encountered a middle aged lady staff who was rude and displayed a bad attitude, which negatively impacted my experience. To Lim or the owner of this business: employing staff with poor customer service can harm your business!

Regarding the food, while it was decent, the condiments provided were insufficient and overly diluted. Condiments are a critical aspect of this meal and can significantly influence a customer's impression. I strongly recommend addressing these issues promptly to ensure the success of your business.",2024-12-08T04:04:07.927Z,food and beverages

Ordered a regular plate for old times sake, chatted with her, and was amazed that she still remembered me!

She gave me a RIDICULOUS free upgrade by adding a bit of everything and then flat out refused to take any more money from me. HOW CAN LIKE THAT? 😭

Aunty has been work tirelessly for so many years d, during uni holidays also usually she is one of the small handful of stalls open throughout, so y'all please support and buy from aunty more k?",2024-08-20T16:26:47.033Z,food and beverages

FFS this is hands down one of the better if not the best hokkien mee I’ve ever had. Generous portions with the noodles and pork lard, awesome chilli, perfect zhup (gravy), wonderful wok hei and best of all, don’t need to bother with those hype queues (this is very important) at not so tasty hokkien mee stalls elsewhere.

Xiao Di KKM & Hokkien Mee,5,"I’ve had my fair share of Hokkien Mee over the years, but every once in a while, you come across a plate that reminds you exactly why this dish is a local icon. Smoky, rich, and unapologetically messy, this version hit all the right notes.

The first thing that grabbed me was the wok hei, that elusive charred aroma that tells you the cook knows their way around a wok. It clung to every strand of noodle, wrapping the yellow noodles and bee hoon in a smoky hug. The gravy wasn’t overly wet or too thick, just the right amount to coat without drowning and packed with that deep, slow-cooked seafood umami that only comes from proper prawn stock.

The prawns were fresh and had that satisfying snap when you bite into them, while the bits of squid added a nice chew. But the real surprise? The crispy pork lard scattered generously on top. Golden, crunchy, and sinful in the best way possible.

Mix in the chilli and a squeeze of lime and the whole thing transforms spicy, tangy, and even more addictive. I found myself scraping the plate for every last bit.

Is it the healthiest meal? Definitely not. But if you’re after comfort food that delivers on bold flavours and that unmistakable wok-fired taste, this Hokkien Mee is hard to beat.",2025-08-10T16:32:40.230Z,food and beverages

For sgd 5 wanton noodle, there was barely any ( any) ingredients.   While I understand many business owners may use rising costs as an excuse to save up on ingredients, but I do not think it's wise to charge people for sgd 5 with barely any 料。 the wantons are a joke.  The char siew are really just a few flat pcs. Vegetables are just a few pathetic pieces too.  Go if you are a Carbs lover ( not keen in ingredients)

For better comparison, I'm attaching screen shot of how OTHER STALLS are serving their customers by charging you only Sgd 5 a bowl.

Chef Kang’s Noodle House,4,"I was recommended this stall by a friend who mentioned that it had been awarded a Michelin Star. It’s located inside an industrial building canteen, and I queued for close to 20 minutes before getting my food.

I ordered their No. 1 Signature Wanton Mee ($7). The first thing that stood out was the noodles — noticeably more al dente compared to the softer, traditional style. The char siew came in five lean slices; personally, I would have preferred them a little fattier for more depth of flavor. The soup only had two wantons, but it was surprisingly rich and umami.

Overall, it’s a well-executed plate of Wanton Mee and certainly above average. That said, I still lean towards the more traditional version with its distinctive sauce base infused with subtle notes of dried octopus.",2025-08-19T15:15:24.872Z,food and beverages

Chef Kang’s Noodle House,4,"Amazing wantan noodles.  There were about 20 pax ahead of me but the queue was rather fast.  About 20mins queue.   The queue was even longer after my queue. 😳
The noodles was as good as they said! Fine but al dente .  The char siew is really good and I really love the wantan .  Will come back again",2025-08-17T05:18:35.853Z,food and beverages
Chef Kang’s Noodle House,5,"Queue is long and the staff are emotionless.. but the wanton noodle is great.

Visited on a Sunday morning and coffeeshop is full and there were around 10 customers in the queue.. managed to get a table while still in the queue as the customers moved quite fast.

The chef cooks quite fast and the quite moved quite fast.

Orders the signature wanton noodles and wanton noodles with abalone slices. Added a plate of Char Siew which is$13

Char siew is superb and very tasty. The wanton is big and filled with meat.. the soup with the wanton is very tasty too. Noodles was a lot and very Q.

One of the best wanton noodle I've had ..
Repeated customer myself.

Updated: 16 Aug 25
Noodles portion is generous and char siew is still very nice. A bit on the fatty side but nice.
Today I noticed the wanton is big and good!",2025-08-16T04:40:19.731Z,food and beverages

Chef Kang’s Noodle House,5,"Definitely one of the TOP 3 in Singapore along side koung’s and 88 roast.. I can’t pinch any unsatisfying area on this bowl of wtm.

I wanna shout out to their soup n wanton which is usually not prioritize in wtm. The soup has a feel of double boiled soup where u normally experience in highend restaurants where u pay $50 for a portion. Hongkong style plump wanton fill with adequate ingredients n seasoning for the punch.

$7 for this bowl of comfort is 100% justifiable. For those Singaporeans always complain abt overprice n pricey , pls sometimes think n imagine how much work is put in at back of kitchen. The effort, sweat n heart that brings u a bowl of hearty noodle. Another $1-$2, cmon ! rate fairly ..",2025-08-14T03:43:20.180Z,food and beverages
Chef Kang’s Noodle House,5,You will almost definitely need to queue to order. The portion is large and will fill you. The noodles are well cooked and the nice sauce covers everything after tossing. The char siew quality is good and not too fatty. The dumpling is super delicious and is packed with lots of ingredients unlike other wanton noodles. The soup that the dumplings come with is also flavourful. Overall a lovely meal. No wonder they are a Michelin bib gourmand listing.,2025-08-14T03:18:34.717Z,food and beverages
Chef Kang’s Noodle House,1,"I was a first-time customer some time ago and saw a long queue, so I decided to return for a second visit. Unfortunately, my second experience was very disappointing due to poor hygiene practices. While preparing my food, a staff member used a straw to dig his teeth, did not wash his hands, and then handled my noodles with bare hands. When I asked him to wash his hands before continuing, he looked unhappy. I don’t mind what people do in their own time, but anyone handling food should wash their hands before touching it especially after such actions. This is basic hygiene. For a stall claiming to be Michelin-grade, the hygiene standards of the staff were far below expectations. Perhaps this is why there was no queue on my second visit.",2025-08-14T00:58:49.742Z,food and beverages

Chef Kang’s Noodle House,5,"It was some of the best noodles and pork char siew I've ever had. The commute and long walk was definitely worth it. The serving time was really quick. The noodles with or without the abalone was very delicious, and the wonton soup was also very good. The highlight though was the char siew. Very tender and juicy and the flavor really comes through. Highly recommended.",2025-08-07T03:05:02.867Z,food and beverages

Chef Kang’s Noodle House,5,"Noodles with a firm bite texture. The dark soy sauce gives it a nice deep soy flavour with a sweet char siew flavour to the Noodles. The char siew does not look it but has a sweet bbq meat flavour. Then the dumpling, packed so full of flavour",2025-08-06T05:16:06.735Z,food and beverages
Chef Kang’s Noodle House,5,"Easily one of the best WTM that suits my taste. Came for breakfast on a weekday and it was a beeeze. The neighboring stall - Teochew kuay teow mee is equally popular so you know what the weekend crown would be like. Easy 🅿️

Basic is $7 ($12 if you add on shredded abalone) and cannot buy extra wontons.
1. Style - black sauce
2. Noodles - thin and crunchy. Not the type that absorbs sauce
3. Portion - generous veg, adequate noodles, 6 thick juicy slices of char siew, well fried pork lard
4. Char siew - was lucky to have a good balance of lean meat to fat ratio. But 1 slice was overly charred and I left it uneaten for cancer causing reasons.
5. Wonton - just 2 balls which in my opinion is better than 4 flat wontons elsewhere",2025-08-05T12:30:50.425Z,food and beverages

Chef Kang’s Noodle House,5,Well balanced bowl of wanton mee. Noodles were cooked Al Dante with a perfect bite. Tender char siew with the right ratio of fats. Wanton was filled to the brim like a large siew mai paired with a nice bowl of collagen soup.,2025-08-05T02:17:14.533Z,food and beverages
Chef Kang’s Noodle House,4,"Finally get to try their viral Noodles with Wanton and Char Siew after a 50 minutes queue on a Sunday noon. (Joined the queue from 11:55am, and placed my order at 12:45pm… waited for another 2 to 3 minutes for the noodles).

Anyway, it was worth the effort as for S$7.00, you get a restaurant standard Noodles with Char Siew and Wanton. The Noodles were firm and chewy, and tossed in a well-balanced savoury dark sauce with generous amount of lard.

Added a small scoop of sambal chilli to elevate the overall flavour further, however be advise not to add too much as it may be too salty for some.

Their Char Siew steals the spotlight with glistening caramelised edges, delicated balance of sweet, savoury and smoky too. Slices were slightly charred outside by tender and juicy inside, with a good mix of lean and fatty layers. Quite imilar to what was being served in Chef Kang’s Private Dining previously, but with even better ratio of lean and fatty layers, but cost about 3 times more. However i am not too sure if both are related, but both had similar logo.

Wantons were plump and filled with generous amount of minced pork plus other bits of ingredients, wrapped in silky skins and boiled till tender, served with rich and flavourful chicken broth on the side.

Will return again during off peak period on weekdays, as its too crowded on Sunday due to patronization of many families… Not only difficult to find seats due to the awkward seating arrangement of a canteen, but also uncomfortable to dine.",2025-08-04T13:24:50.220Z,food and beverages
Chef Kang’s Noodle House,4,"First, the Q is long!
Overall, wan Tan mee was above average. I find it slightly tough but generally ok. Char siew is a personal choice. I like it less fatty. And the wan tan slightly salty. Still good and tasty from the overall perspective. But not really 5 star.",2025-08-04T05:32:04.842Z,food and beverages

Noodles is tasty and chewy, charsiew is pretty fatty but nice. $7 for a fairly huge portion. Do expect to share table with others since it's quite busy during the lunch hour.",2025-08-02T04:36:28.436Z,food and beverages
Chef Kang’s Noodle House,4,"The good: Wanton was great (loved the inclusion of black fungus), wanton soup was unique (opaque and peppery), chili was fragrant (I can't really take spice so I usually skip chili but I compromised on this one by adding a bit with each spoonful!). Noodles did not have the alkaline taste (cause it's the bamboo one?). Lard was great, would recommend not stirring it into the sauce if you want to keep its crunch. Char siew was good!

The not-so-great: Noodles were a bit too soft for me, but then again I love extremely al dente noodles. But sadly these were just passable but not ""tiak"". The sauce also sadly did not stand out (probably why I felt the need to reach for the chili).

Too warm and sunny (it's ""indoors"" insofar as you're under shelter - it's at the corner of an industrial building), but if it was raining I imagine a good portion of the tables would get wet.

It's a good bowl of wanton noodles (one of the best according to Alderic), and I left feeling satiated and glad that I made a trip down to try. But given the queue and seating conditions, I don't see myself coming back just for it.",2025-07-31T00:00:00.373Z,food and beverages
Chef Kang’s Noodle House,4,"A solid 4.5/5 for me

It's basically a 1 man show, chef taking orders and cooking at the same time. Absolutely loved the noodles, it was al dente and doesn't have the alkaline taste. The wanton soup is also amazing. The char siew is a little bit too fatty for my liking. Some bites were almost pure fat. I added noodles for my order and towards the end of the meal it felt a bit surfeiting due to the sauce.",2025-07-30T12:05:45.929Z,food and beverages
Chef Kang’s Noodle House,5,"I get how they've earned a Michelin star. Well deserved. Is it the most mind blowing tasting bowl of noodles? No. But it's executed at a very high level few can replicate.

Kokoro Izakaya,4,"Great ambience for japanese Restaurant. Food wise is also good, presentation is also pretty. 😊

One bad experience is that the Miso soup cover has formed a kind of vacuum and it makes the lid  difficult to open. And when opened , the soup tend to spill / lid fly away. I recommend to change to an easier to open lid, because not only did I experience this opening lid challenge, my colleague also experience similar case. The crew quickly changed new green tea for me when I accidentally bumped and dropped the Drink. Kudos to the great quick Service.

They also have live band every Wednesday and Friday 6.30pm, it's interesting concept for a japanese Restaurant. 🥰🥰🥰",2025-08-18T08:21:19.186Z,food and beverages

Kokoro Izakaya,3,"I didn’t realize they had a live band, I wasn’t quite prepared to be dining in a noisy loud environment. Food was really average and some below average. Service was so so. I ordered a bottle of Ozeki Umeshu but they ended up serving a different Yuzu bottle instead. Although server came back to inform the one I ordered was out of stock and they’d gladly refund the wrong bottle served to us but it’ll be good if this was done upfront instead ie inform us the one we ordered was outta stock and check if we wish to order some others. The eventual bottle that was served to us didn’t even offer me any buzz even though it showed 14% alcohol on the back of the bottle. Not sure if it was kept too long cos there were definitely some yellow stuff floating on the surface when we poured the drink into a cup.

Crave Nasi Lemak,1,"Hi CRAVE Nasi Lemak , Im referring this to your Joo Koon fairprice hub branch.

I ordered a nasi lemak ayam berempah today, meant to be given to the kids. However, I found it upsetting and off putting when i saw the following scene unfolded right before my eyes.

Your employee, who was packing the order was sneezing openly with no cover. Granted, the person tried to turn away from the food area but still sneezed openly, multiple times.

She then proceded to wear a black mask.

Subsequently, before she continued packing, she was wiping her nose with a tissue while having the food gloves on. I did not see which hand (gloved or not) which was used to wipe her nose. Nonetheless, she did NOT EVEN WASH HER HANDS prior to packing the food.

Looking at this disgusting behavior, i did not even want to inform your staff and walked away without collecting the food, even though payment had been made.

For an F&B business, i believe staff should be well aware of hygiene when operating the store. This was actually food meant to be given to kids and the lack of hygiene awareness is baffling.

Hope you would take the necessary actions to prevent this from happening. Thanks.",2025-08-24T13:48:26.189Z,food and beverages

Crave Nasi Lemak,1,"No STAR for all!!!

I have unpleasant experience with your foods and staffs. Firstly, I have encountered few times that I need to wait for longer time after payment made at kiosk.Hence this time,I ordered thru foodpanda as pick up order cos I have bad experience on waiting.

I have arrived 11:20 after ordering as the app stated 11:12 for pick up time.
To my horror, I didn't see a trace of my order. I asked the counter staff when will my order be ready, she shouted oh Foodpanda order.  Coming coming.... I sat quietly and waited awhile n approached them again the lady said 10mins so I walked out and get my other stuffs.
When I went bk,the order still not ready, with no choice as I already paid for the food so I waited another 10mins. After good 15mins, I went to ask again they replied unhappily not ready not ready !! Pardon me,I should be the one who feel unhappy cos I waited far too long!!!
Your staffs seem not organized and take a longer time for preparation.
Once opened the box, the fried chicken skin is burnt and hard due to high heat!!

Hope the management can help to educate your staffs with time management and effectiency.",2025-02-08T16:45:53.033Z,food and beverages

I ordered Garlic Sliced Pork and Lotus Root Soup. The garlic pork was packed with flavours. The lotus soup was just mid. Well I think if you go with a group of friends where you can share many dishes at one go. It's also good for singles who want to have a peaceful meal.

Hi Noodle,4,"Tomato shrimp ball noodle - rich, fragrant tomato broth. Not too sweet or sour. Different from your usual tomato broth as it has an additional fragrance from the vegetables used in the broth.

Spicy braised chicken feet - The braised sauce is extremely fragrant and flavourful, with an umami flavour. It's not your usual salty braised sauce. The chicken feet were so soft that the bones fell off with ease.

Tried brown sugar bun and tomato with egg as well, but not too special.

Hi Noodle,4,a cute and inoffensive little food spot in jurong point. you walk in and are immediately prompted (by the very nice owner lady~) whether you want to eat noodles or rice. the rice option will bring you towards a counter wherein you may choose whatever accompaniments your heart desires. the rice itself was just slightly dry for my taste but the convenience and the overall ingredient quality made the experience a net positive !! the complimentary ice cream at the end was also a sweet touch~ <3,2025-04-08T02:38:09.609Z,food and beverages

Service wise if compare to the Hi hotpot next door is totally diff. Non-existing if you want to do that. You are on your own.

Everything is great except service. Still have to ask for free ice cream. Not automatically given or at least ask when we saw someone in front playing with the free ice cream cone machine.

Hi Noodle,4,"Surprised to spot this outlet inside this shopping mall. Should have guess that it is under the same management as haidilao. Already tried at their original outlet at Somerset 313 when they were newly opened. And then also tried at the outlet at Woodleigh mall. Totally new & differ concept from the other 2 outlets. More towards the traditional cai fan, yet can do it yourself to take the dishes. And make payment at the weighing machine. Thks for the free ice-cream again. And really small portion for the noodles. Felt so full after finished eating 😋

Updates : went back again. Still as yummy. Hope they have other outlets at city area with this similar concept. The lotus soup was tasty. First time ordered the soup. It was really good. But this time round, didn't collect the token for their free ice-cream.",2024-09-27T17:37:19.909Z,food and beverages

Payment is convenient, there’s someone there who helps with the machines as well. The tomato noodles were pretty good. They have a condiment station, be sure to get their signature chilli sauce!

Hi Noodle,5,"This is my third time at Hi noodle, and I finally understand why it exists. It is everything that Haidilao isnt, for good reason.
Don't want people to talk to you? Check.
Want things fast? Check.
Want low sodium? Yes, yes, yes.
Don't want food scalding hot? Check.
Don't want food too spicy? Check.

Hi noodle is healthy fast food, for small crowd who wants to eat and leave. All the food start out a bit low-salt and low-spice. I've tried suan la fen and chicken liver noodles and I was quite disappointed initially, but then I saw the condiment counter with chilli, soya sauce, vinegar and then I realise - oh thats why. If you want healthy, you found the right place. If you want more seasoning, you've gotta masterchef it yourself.

For sides, I've tried a lot. Here are some personal favourites:
Potato 土豆丝 $3.90  vinegary, not spicy.
Braised Quail eggs $4
King oyster mushroom $2.50
Minced garlic pork 蒜泥白肉 $5.80 (fantastic!)
Mapo tofu $4.90 (not spicy, not salty)

Believe it or not, I ate all the above with brown rice ($2). I can't believe I'm eating brown rice at Haidilao chain, but yes. Healthy. If I didn't order pork, it felt like Greendot healthy. Nothing was salty, so those looking to cut salt, this place is for you.

Ice cream is fabulous. Better than mcdonalds. Wafer cone was crispy and sweet, and the ice cream wasnt icy, but very thick, rich and creamy.

Inclusive of GST, no service charge (no one dancing with noodles or singing bday song or giving your kids toys)

Ambience very nice and clean. You can pick and mix your own sauce on their sauce bar. Foods are nice, had their soup with rice and noodle and some vegetables. Get your free ice cream after returning your tray after dine in.

When asked, I informed the staff that I wanted it to be spicy, however when noodles arrived, it was tasteless. Fried noodles was very oily, no salt, no spice so I had to add the chili on my own. However as the chili provided was only chili soaked in oil, this did not help with the taste at all. Noodles were so hard I suspect they were under cooked. The only saving grace is the soup which had some taste to it. Spicy oyster mushrooms were normal tasting.
At least the service staff were nice, not the best but at least they did their job.

It’s a China food, chosen sliced noodle.   It is cooked just right.   Beef quality is quite good.    Just the noodle portion is too small.   Ordered the mixed beef, which is about 20bucks considered quite expensive for a bowl of noodles.
Environment is quite pleasant, just that stuff sleeping on the table which I feel that it’s quite uncomfortable.

This one is in the same vein, & what is wonderful is that they have their own dry noodles type added to their repertoire of la mian dishes!

Noodle is soft and good chewy, the char siu is savory!! Fried wan tan were crispy. Topping Vegie tastes like freshly boiled.

椿风满面 (Chun Feng Man Mian) Chun Noodle Bar - Amoy,5,"Rating: 4.8 / 5 stars

On first sight — a tiny bit pretentious, like the fusion ramens of Amoy. However, I was quickly proven wrong. This is easily the best char siew wanton mee in Amoy Street, hands down.

The store has few but solid offerings and at a reasonable price point. Here’s what to expect:
- Char Siew: an appropriate cut with a good amount of fat, the meat was well marinated and caramalised.
- Noodles: fairly standard, but executed well. The seasoning sauce mix used works
- Chilli: was slightly sambal-ish and smelt punchy, but turned out to complement the flavours of the dish really well. Noticeably, it didn’t add too much saltiness to the dish.
- Wanton: nothing to shout about.
- Soup: was essentially tonkotsu ramen soup, though milder. I feel ashamed asking for a refill.

Portions were fair, though I do wish that they were just a little more generous with the noodles. Additional noodles are available for $1.

Plus point: this stall accepts paywave, contributing to your Team Cashback vs Team Miles debate.",2024-12-30T14:43:26.903Z,food and beverages

Fan Ji Speciality Noodle,4,"Special Mushroom Mee Pok w/ Meat Ball (No.2)

Overall, the meepok is decent, however, the meepok he uses is thicker than most others, so that might throw some off, due to the textural difference. The saucing of the noodles was a tad too salty, but I'm still ok with it. But let me rave about the soup which is chock full of thinly sliced wongbok giving the broth a natural sweetness and the HerKio (Fish Dumplings) were on another level. Hard to come by a great HerKio these days, and this was awesome.",2025-08-05T07:55:59.354Z,food and beverages
Fan Ji Speciality Noodle,5,"Must go weekly BCM. If you have not tried Fan Ji (previously Ah Hoe Mee Pok), it's a delighfully fulfilling meal that tastes just different from everyone else. There's a variety of choice of different toppings & ingredient. It looks expensive, but I'd rather have this because of the exceptional value the meal provides. Firstly, you can ask for extra noodles (no extra charge). For set 5 ($9), my go to meal, I get 2 slices of abalone, 1 shrimp dumpling, 1 teochew dumpling, lots of cabbage, lean meat, minced meat & braised mushroom other than the SOP precision timing cooked noodles (mee pok) & a wonderfully hot & tasty soup which usually is an after-thought of the meal. So there you go. My photo doesn't do much justice to my review. Just come down to try once. It will take a lot to beat this stall.",2025-07-13T06:46:41.760Z,food and beverages

Fan Ji Speciality Noodle,3,"I ordered the prawn paste specialty noodle. Overall, the taste was pretty good. The noodles looked plump, but still had a nice bite, decently sauced. The soup was sweet, a little porky and there was a decent amount of prawn paste cubes, minced meat and cabbage.
However, the cabbage was a little too crunchy for my liking. It was not nuah enough and the cabbage juice was bitter with no vegetable sweetness. The prawn cubes were good, but could be bouncier and the texture could be better, such as tasting individual prawn pastes held together, rather than just one cube by itself. The overall dish was not proportioned very well. Both my dining companion and I finished the noodles way before the soup and ingredients were finished.

However the chili sauce and the base sauce for the noodles were very different from the original Ah Hoe Mee Pok. The pork lard used tasted factory made not hand made and the soupbase was blend. Overall it is still an ok noodle dish. However when i ate this, it brings back memories of the original ah hoe mee pok and how i wish this bowl of noodle could live up to it. I still have faith in Fan Ji Specialty Noodle. I just wish it did skew so far away from the original taste. I understand the young owner may want to put his own twist to this noodle, i get it. But I feel some good things are not meant to be changed.",2025-04-24T23:50:41.254Z,food and beverages

Their noodle combos are mostly seafood based, the homemade prawn paste version is  especially nice. Definitely worth the drive to Ayer Rajah.",2025-04-16T06:05:25.153Z,food and beverages
Fan Ji Speciality Noodle,2,"Update: Unfortunately this place does not use the thick Mee Pok noodles which Ah Hoe used, see old review below. Also the sauce was too salty. I had to literally dunk the noodles in the soup before I could eat it.  Don't understand why there is still a queue.

The noodles are thick and not the factory made kind. It's perfectly cooked giving it a lovely chewy texture (very Q). Had the $6 bowl which has lots of ingredients and comes with a large bowl of soup. You can ask for more noodles at no additional cost.
The only drawback is the soup is not as tasty as some of the famous BCM stalls in SG but the noodles are definitely the best and you don't have to queue like crazy. Photo shows lunch time queue.",2025-03-25T07:14:57.310Z,food and beverages

The broth was rich and deeply flavorful, with a perfect balance of umami and sweetness. It had that slow-cooked depth that comes from hours of many ingredients, making every sip satisfying.

The noodles were cooked just right—firm yet springy, soaking up the broth without turning mushy. As for the pork lard, it was very crunchy, with just the right amount of fat to keep things indulgent but not overwhelming.

Overall it was a heartwarming dish that delivered on both taste and texture. Whether you’re craving comfort food or just looking for a solid noodle dish, this is definitely worth trying.",2025-03-06T12:46:23.937Z,food and beverages

RAMLAH KAMAL NASI PADANG,3,"Order rice,sambal goreng,paru sambal and ayam curry $7.Price is ok.The part that im not happy is that why is some of the rice so hard.Did u check before servin someone? Or u purposely dont want to waste the rice thats y u still serve to customer.U must understand this we r paid customer we r not gettin the food for free.So we deserve fresh quality of food.Thats not all even the chicken i choose u gave me so stingy.3 pieces of chicken that has been cut like a piece of nugget.2 pieces meat with bone on it and the other piece u gave me is a chicken that has no meat on it.more to bone.🤦‍♂️ Pls avoid being stingy when ur sellin food.Cause u want customer to come back not run away.If u keep being like this no customer will want to come back to ur stall.And u r lookin at it.This will be the last time im goin to ur stall.",2023-12-15T03:38:40.338Z,food and beverages
RAMLAH KAMAL NASI PADANG,2,"Taste is fine... but lontong gravy is cold hence making the rice taste uncooked. And it is too expensive.

Lontong + a little bit of tempeh... $6.  When asked this quantity of tempeh charge $2, she just look at me and smile.

If wanna charge $2, by all means, but at least give more.

Clean renovated environment though.",2023-12-13T00:16:13.704Z,food and beverages

RAMLAH KAMAL NASI PADANG,1,"Let’s begin with the price. $8 for a small piece of stingray ($4) , I can understand, no problem. The other $4 for a chicken wing , egg and white rice??? Mind you, not nasi lemak rice. Just plain white rice. No ikan bilis or anything else. The aunty looks like she can’t be bothered to explain so maybe business too good.

Best part was the chicken wing was bloody. I decided that it was not worth food poisoning over as the chicken wing wasn’t much to shout about either.

When they first opened, there was an elderly aunty. She was genuinely keen on making her food nice. I don’t see her these days and can only hope that these blokes don’t throw her efforts down into the drain.",2023-10-04T01:02:03.823Z,food and beverages

RAMLAH KAMAL NASI PADANG,4,"Came there in the morning. Surprisingly, prior to that morning I was craving for some Lontong. And their food was exactly what I imagined it to be. Rendezvous.

Let's start with the lemak gravy.
It was rich but not too sinful or else you know the cholesterol is gonna climb up. The vegetables in the lontong was generous. Then we move to the rice cake.
Rice cake was soft and fresh. What more can you ask for? Pretty straightforward. And the hard boiled egg to compliment lontong. Lastly, the sambal was on point. Not too spicy to a point where it will be uncomfortable, but it was balance. Good enough to give that gravy a kick!

So if you're around the corner, come give this family stall a try, and enjoy the food.",2023-07-28T18:48:59.776Z,food and beverages
