Apex Medical Centre Pte Ltd,1,"do not be in healthcare industry if you lack basic empathy. Counter staff in her 30s were extremely rude, shouted at my elderly grandma.

Apex Medical Centre Pte Ltd,1,"I was told by one of the clinic assistant at 615pm that the doctor would be available at 7pm, with my turn likely around 8-830pm. This is frustrating, as if the clinic had answered my call earlier and issued a queue number, I could have gone home to have dinner, shower, and return on time. Instead, I had no choice but to wait at the clinic, as going home would have been too rushed and risked missing my turn.

I attempted to purchase medication but was met with unhelpful and poorly trained auntie staff who was unable to advise me on suitable options based on my prescription history. The lack of professionalism and competence from the clinic assistants is deeply disappointing.

I have decided not to return to this clinic and will lodge a formal complaint with the MOH and inform the area MP. Patients deserve better service and proper training for clinic staff to avoid such inconveniences.",2025-02-11T11:40:51.264Z,Retail
Apex Medical Centre Pte Ltd,1,"If you‚Äôre looking for poor diagnosis, wasted time, and rude customer service, this clinic is the place to go.

I had the unfortunate experience of visiting this clinic twice in 2024, both times being consulted by Dr. Goh.

1.	August 2024 ‚Äì I sprained my thumb, and the pain extended to my wrist. I explained that I couldn‚Äôt move my thumb, and my wrist was in significant pain. Dr. Goh briefly examined my wrist and simply stated that it was sprained. He prescribed ointment, but the pain worsened over the next week. I later visited a polyclinic where the doctor provided a more thorough assessment, diagnosing a nerve injury in my wrist that required a steroid injection. After being referred to a hospital and receiving the injection, I recovered fully within three days.

2.	September 2024 ‚Äì I experienced heavy menstrual bleeding for two weeks. Dr. Goh advised me to take Norethisterone for 20 days to stop the flow. When I asked if it was necessary to take it for so many days, he insisted it was. He also added that I should take high blood pressure pills, despite me telling him I don‚Äôt have high blood pressure. He tested my blood pressure three times and insisted it was abnormal. I explained that I‚Äôve had low blood pressure most of my life and that the elevated reading might be due to panic after bleeding excessively. He refused to reconsider, claiming that high blood pressure pills would reduce the bleeding. When I tested my blood pressure at home, it was normal.

3.	Patient Privacy Concerns ‚Äì There‚Äôs absolutely no regard for patient privacy in this clinic. Two of the counter staff (packing medication and collecting payments) are respectful, speaking softly when dealing with patients‚Äô personal information. However, the two seated behind the counter never get up and instead shout out patients‚Äô full names, NRIC numbers, house addresses, and phone numbers for everyone to hear. During both of my visits, I witnessed them shouting at elderly patients. On one occasion, an elderly man mentioned it was his first time at the clinic, and the staff loudly responded, ‚ÄúWhy must you come here?‚Äù I also saw a middle-aged woman buying medication without her physical NRIC. Instead of proper verification, the seated staff simply asked her to recite her NRIC number and proceeded to sell the medication. Isn‚Äôt this dangerous? Why isn‚Äôt there a proper process in place? People come to the clinic unwell ‚Äì the least they deserve is respectful treatment.",2024-10-02T16:18:30.943Z,Arts

Apex Medical Centre Pte Ltd,5,"I dare say this clinic's handling covid the best out of the 4 clinics in the area.

They actually had signs out to tell patients when the queue is full (I highly recommend putting Chinese / Malay / Tamil signs too, at the side of the counter facing out to the door. Might help elderly patients and foreign workers who do not know English). This is already a world of difference from another clinic I shall not name, which I waited at for 30 mins yesterday only to be told to head over to the next door clinic and wait for 2.5H, because I'm not company sponsored. (They didn't even put a sign, srsly. Half the queue were not company sponsored.)

They also had special signs for people who self-tested ART positive too. Unlike yet another clinic in the area I shall not name, which claimed to do Swab tests online but turned me away in person saying 'no swab test here', APEX is legit. They understood the need when I told them I'm ART positive. They accommodated me when I asked if I could be given a queue no. for couple of hours later, despite the queue being full. Sure their phone line may be down, but their in-person service definitely benefits from that.

Service-wise, the staff were most efficient and polite, and I'm really thankful to Dr Tay, who cracked a joke when she saw how sombre I was about getting covid. The brave lady did not even bulk when I pulled down my mask, despite my fear of transmitting Covid to her. Kudos to her!

If there is one complain I do have, it would be the signage out at the front. It's good that APEX gets along so well with the Universal Dental Group that they even share similar letter fonts, but at first, I didn't dare go in thinking I might end up strapping myself in for a teeth drilling session. Now's not the time for sure, but in the future, when Covid does lighten up, hopefully the clinic will consider rebranding with different letter fonts, if not add an Upstairs and Downstairs Arrow logo alongside the different establishments.",2022-02-08T12:21:48.757Z,education

A contact number to the TCM clinic was provided for me to reach out to Dr Zhong but I was told by the clinic that is not a number to reach the main investigator. After I feedback to Mr Peter Lim, he did not offer me a direct email to Dr Zhong. I found Dr Zhong‚Äôs email and wrote her an urgent mail for her to respond. She did not attend to my email since Wednesday, 23/4/25. Due to the non response I emailed QSM of NTU yet my email was also unattended. There was also no follow-up effort from Mr Peter Lim although the issue was as important as the handling of patient‚Äôs urine specimen.

Fullerton Dental,1,"Dr. Mok who works every Wednesday is really irresponsible.

40 days ago I paid a very high price to have a tooth fixed. After about 40 days, the filling developed a problem and it hurt when I drank cold water. So, I suspect that the material has fallen out, but of course, it could be something else, so I want to go for a review. Dr. Mok said she would remove the previous material and replace it with one that was temporary and did not guarantee results. I expressed my concern because once the medication failed, my teeth would be exposed and more damage would be done. Then,  after I refused to use this material, I asked if I could use the original material and Dr. Mok refused. So I decided not to change because, after all, no one wants to revert to a temporary, less good-looking material without taking that much risk. Dr. Mok went on to say that if I were to leave, she would have to take a photograph of my teeth to prove that there was nothing wrong with her fillings. I thought this was utterly ridiculous. If she was so adamant that there was no problem, why did she change me to a bad material in the first place? If I don't change the material, do I have to prove that her padding is fine? I felt that she was simply shirking her responsibility. She would not allow me to leave if I refused to have my photo taken because the case had to be documented. High charges + bad attitude + shirking responsibility make me very unhappy and I hope someone will pay attention to this matter.",2022-04-13T14:04:00.683Z,Arts

Message from NIE said that the complusory health screening is free. However, before any screening is done, I was asked to pay $55. The staff said that they had informed NIE about the miscommunication. Payment cannot be made by VISA as their machine is down.

Procedure:
Before the health screening, we had to print out a form to fill in physically. It's quite long, detailing not just our personal medical details but also our family's medical history. During the screening, the nurse fill in another form with the test results. After that, we were ushered to a tablet station to key in everything again digitally, rendering all the hard copies redundant. The digital form is 15 pages long, and the touchscreen is not sensitive, so it took a very long time to key in those information that took a very long time to complete on hardcopy in the first place.

Privacy:
The waiting room for X-ray consists of 2 rows of chairs placed facing each other and in uncomfortably close distance. (Note that females are required to remove their bras and wear only plain T-shirts.) There's a curtain to separate the waiting room from the rest of the clinic, but once we're called for the X-ray, we'll have to go out. (Ladies, you might want to go with a jacket to cover yourself.)

As a medical professional myself, I can genuinely say that meeting Dr. David, my father‚Äôs oncologist at Singapore National Cancer Centre (NCCS), has been one of the most inspiring experiences in this journey.

From the very first appointment, I could see his depth of knowledge, professionalism, and compassion. His clinical judgment is exceptional ‚Äî calm, clear, and deeply reassuring. I‚Äôve learned so much just by being in the room with him during my father‚Äôs visits.

Despite being told in Dubai that my father might have a new cancer, Dr. David‚Äôs expertise helped reveal that this was not the case. His careful review and insight proved that the earlier findings were incorrect ‚Äî and for that, my entire family is deeply grateful. I‚Äôm truly happy I traveled all the way from Dubai for this opinion and treatment. It was absolutely worth it.

I also want to thank Dr. Brian, my father‚Äôs surgeon at Singapore General Hospital, for his excellent care and support throughout this process.

Institute of Mental Health,1,"Hi any readers,

For your best information, about this hospital IMH, the doctors and staffs are good, but I have to try my luck to find my sister's doctor in charge, and the medical doctors and nurses like to use verbally call to inform and get consent from the parents of the patient, which is really an unethical method!

And, when I called in and make an appointment, the IMH customer service will say the doctor to call back, but no call received so is a waste of time!

Meanwhile, the worst part is the IMH doctor-in-charge did not get the patient's next of kin's/ parents' sign consent before sending my sister for ETC brain treatment, and will said that they have the doctor's rights of detaining patients as hospitalized in IMH.

Then, even worst part is IMH didn't provide these following reports to patient's next of kin/ the parents such as medical reports/ attempted medical treatments/ report/ types of further medical treatments report/ medicines assigned to patients during hospitalized in IMH.

In such way, the doctor-in-charge proceeded ETC brain treatments to my sister, with a verbally call consent, while the next of kin / the parents of patient had rejected it by all means.

Which of it, it is an illegal act of action from IMH, and I would like to let the people who has this similiar situation, to report to the Singapore medical council or association/ lodge a police report/ file a warning letter to IMH/ and hired a lawyer for claim back patient's rights/ to apply for discharged from IMH immediately by next of kin/ the parents of the patient, due to patient's incapacity due to sickness or illness to rejecting any unknown medical treatments assigned to the patients.

As there is no right or wrong for any brain treatments provided by any hospitals, if any, unsuccessful treatments which has already caused damages to the patient's brain.

This is why i felt so disappointed on IMH medical practices and procedures on handling any patients in IMH.

So, i would like to highlight the consequences for patient's rights being violated or suffered harm due to:
1) Medical negligence/ malpractice,
2) Violation of patient rights, including of failing to obtain parent's consent,
3) Illegal treatments without proper authorization or administering treatments by obtaining parent's consent
4) providing particulars of the doctor-in charge who is handling patient's medical diagnosis and treatments
5) the difficulty of finding the doctor-in-charge with no appointment with the next-of-kin / the parents of the patient.

Therefore, the goodness of diagnosis or medical treatments are not well appreciated by myself and the parents of the patients.",2025-07-09T05:14:44.569Z,retail

Gleneagles Hospital,1,"Premium hospital, substandard service

I wish to express my deep disappointment with the service standards at Gleneagles Hospital, following my admission experience earlier this week.

I arrived at 8:00am for admission and collected a queue number, only to find the queue completely stagnant. When I approached the counter staff, I was brushed off with ‚Äúwait a while‚Äù ‚Äî without explanation, updates, or communication. Eventually, after wasting much time, I was told to proceed to the Day Admission Ward at Level 7.

What followed was even worse. The staff at the ward counter literally tossed the admission letter at me and asked me to sign, with no guidance or courtesy. When I asked twice for clarification, I was given casual, dismissive gestures that turned out to be misleading. Even when I highlighted the mistake, the staff remained cold and indifferent. While a manager eventually came forward to apologise, there was no sincerity or accountability ‚Äî only a token gesture.

On top of that, the food served was shockingly inadequate for a hospital that positions itself as ‚Äúprestigious.‚Äù Breakfast consisted of plain porridge with tofu and peanuts, accompanied only by black coffee. Cold milk was provided only upon request. There was no fruit, no proper protein, and certainly no sign of a balanced or nutritious diet. For patients who are supposed to be recovering, such meals fall far short of basic expectations, and one must question if they even meet minimum hospital nutrition standards.

What shocked me further was the complete lack of follow-up. Until my discharge, I never once received a call or visit from Gleneagles‚Äô management. By contrast, hospitals such as KKH and Thomson respond almost immediately to patient complaints, often sending senior staff to check on patients personally. Gleneagles‚Äô silence reflected indifference, not care.

For a hospital that charges premium rates and brands itself as a top-tier institution, this experience was utterly disappointing. Patients come to Gleneagles expecting care, respect, professionalism, and proper recovery support ‚Äî but what I encountered was stagnation, disregard, and even nutritionally questionable food.

Gleneagles should remember: healing is not just about medicine, but also dignity, respect, and nourishment. Anything less is unacceptable.",2025-08-19T05:15:00.111Z,Retail

Gleneagles Hospital,1,"Summary of Complaint Regarding ICU Care at Gleneagles Hospital

Our family experienced deeply upsetting and unprofessional treatment during our grandfather‚Äôs recent stay in the Intensive Care Unit at Gleneagles Hospital. Despite paying a significant amount with the expectation of receiving world-class care, the service and professionalism we encountered were severely lacking.

Key concerns include:
‚Ä¢	Unprofessional Conduct by ICU Staff: Nurse Corina and another filipino male nurse displayed dismissive, rude, and mocking behavior toward our family members. Reasonable requests and questions were met with false information, poor attitudes, and a lack of empathy ‚Äî all of which are unacceptable in a healthcare environment.

‚Ä¢	Disrespectful Behavior by Dr. Roger Tan: Dr. Tan‚Äôs tone became increasingly sarcastic and impatient, particularly when we needed to translate medical updates for a family member who does not speak English. Need to translate to Palembang dialect. In addition, conflicting medical opinions among ICU doctors about dialysis treatment created confusion and concern over the consistency of care.

‚Ä¢	Lack of Communication and Continuity: After initially encouraging open communication, Dr. Tan became less responsive. Despite our family‚Äôs efforts, including arranging an SOS medical evacuation and bearing high costs.  There was no notable improvement in our grandfather‚Äôs condition. During a critical phase, both primary doctors left the country for a conference, handing the case over to a new doctor unfamiliar with the situation.

‚Ä¢	Concerns Over Staffing Levels: Night shifts appeared to be understaffed, with a few nurse on duty for many ICU patients, raising serious questions about patient safety and monitoring. One is to two patients.

Given the circumstances and the substantial financial and emotional investment our family made, we are extremely disappointed with the level of care received.

During the birthing process especially -- despite the tension being high in the labor room, I was glad that we were surrounded by really positive nurses, midwives, and of course, our gynae too who were so assuring the whole time.

The lactation consultant was also very warm who gave off loving, motherly vibes. We returned to see her abt 2 weeks after discharge as I was stressing over breastfeeding and I felt very much at ease with her empathetic behavior. While she continued to encourage breastfeeding, she constantly reminded us to also prioritize our mental well-being and our baby's needs as well.

Facilities wise, truly nothing to complain. We stayed at one of the suites and it was clean and very well maintained. The meals were decent but still better than most hospital meals we've ever had and it's great that there were options to choose from!

Dear Mount Alvernia's Business Centre Team,
I am writing to share my experience and express my sincere disappointment with how the billing was handled during a deeply distressing moment when my mother was being transferred by ambulance in critical condition.
While I understand the need to settle outstanding charges, I was asked to make payment before I could leave even as the ambulance was departing with my mother. This insistence on immediate payment, under such circumstances, felt lacking in compassion and empathy.
In moments of crisis, I believe families deserve some space and understanding. I hope the hospital can review its processes and empower staff to exercise discretion in such situations, so that others may be spared this added distress during already heartbreaking moments.

Mount Alvernia Hospital,1,"Initially admitted to St. Francis Ward, I endured significant distress due to complications from general anesthesia (GA). I was unable to pass urine from midnight onwards and repeatedly told the nurses that my bladder felt like it was going to explode. Despite my clear and urgent complaints, the nurses performed a bladder scan and insisted my bladder was ‚Äúnot very full.‚Äù When they finally catheterized me after hours of agony, they drained an alarmingly large amount of urine‚Äînearly double what they claimed was present. This dismissive and negligent attitude from the nurses was deeply upsetting and left me feeling unheard and invalidated.
The catheterization process was nothing short of a nightmare. Two nurses attempted to insert the catheter multiple times, causing excruciating pain and leaving me screaming. After several failed attempts, a senior nurse was finally called in to complete the procedure, and while her skill brought some relief, the overall process was traumatic. Even after the catheter was in place, I continued to experience pain and repeatedly raised this with the nurses. I specifically asked if they could check the catheter because of the persistent pain. One nurse brushed me off, saying, ‚ÄúOf course it would be painful; it is a foreign body in you,‚Äù and didn‚Äôt even bother to examine it. This complete lack of compassion and willingness to investigate my concerns was infuriating. When I was finally transferred to St. Raphael Ward‚Äîwhere the nurses were much kinder‚Äîthe difference in care was immediately apparent. The nurses there asked me about the catheter, and when I mentioned that it still felt painful, they were prepared to check it. However, the same senior nurse from St. Francis Ward who was assisting with my transfer‚Äîthe one who had repeatedly dismissed my concerns‚Äîintervened and brushed off my complaint yet again, saying, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just discomfort.‚Äù Is she the one being catheterized? Her consistent dismissal of my pain, even when other staff were willing to help, was completely unacceptable, unprofessional, and uncompassionate.
This same senior nurse, who consistently dismissed my concerns, also exhibited aggressive and demeaning behavior throughout my stay. She scolded my caregiver in an unnecessarily harsh and condescending tone for helping me walk‚Äîa practice that my physiotherapist had explicitly approved. Not content with berating my caregiver, she then turned on me, speaking to me as though I were a child being punished. This was deeply humiliating and entirely uncalled for, especially given the already distressing circumstances I was enduring. Her behavior and repeated dismissive attitude made an already distressing experience feel unbearable. Their discharge process seems to required a complete transformation. Given that I could not walk and relied on a wheelchair, it was incredibly inconvenient and unreasonable to expect me to make my way to a different department to collect my medications. A hospital should prioritize patient convenience, especially for those with limited mobility, but this process was thoughtlessly designed. On top of that, they provided an interim bill during discharge, which required me to pay an excess. They explained that this was not the final bill and that the excess would be refunded once the bill was finalized. Why am I being charged for an interim bill that is not even finalized? This makes no sense and creates unnecessary administrative hassle. I have never encountered such a practice in other hospitals, and it speaks to a system that prioritizes inefficiency. This was my first experience at Mt. A, and it will undoubtedly be my last. The dismissive attitudes, lack of competence, aggressive behavior from staff, and poorly designed processes made this an incredibly distressing experience. For a Catholic hospital that claims to ‚Äúserve all with love,‚Äù my experience felt entirely devoid of compassion or professionalism.",2025-06-28T07:34:55.872Z,retail

From the very moment we entered, we were deeply disappointed by the lack of professionalism‚Äîregistration staff were laughing and talking among themselves instead of attending to patients, which was both inconsiderate and unprofessional.

At the triage stage, the situation was no better. The staff did not even look at my husband‚Äôs wound, despite him being in visible pain and distress. After being made to wait for hours in what was supposed to be an emergency setting, the only treatment offered to him was paracetamol. This was shocking and unacceptable, especially given that his arm was in fact fractured. We had no choice but to go to another emergency centre where he finally received the urgent and proper care he required.

What makes this matter even more concerning is that my husband was not the only one neglected. Many other patients were also left unattended for hours, without updates, care, or compassion. This shows a wider systemic issue rather than an isolated incident.

This entire experience raises very serious concerns: how can patients place their trust in medical professionals who overlook critical injuries, fail to show basic empathy, and dismiss urgent conditions? Emergency centres are meant to provide immediate, accurate, and compassionate care. Instead, my husband and many others were subjected to neglect, mismanagement, and unprofessional behaviour at multiple levels of your service.

I strongly urge the hospital to review this incident in detail and take immediate action to ensure that such lapses never happen again. No patient should be made to suffer unnecessarily in an emergency setting.

I‚Äôve waited three hours for a specialist appointment at private hospitals, so I understand that demand is high and manpower shortages are real. There‚Äôs no point ranting or blaming the hospital it won‚Äôt change the situation. If people already have their own perceptions, nothing will change their mindset unless they experience it themselves.

The A&E at Sengkang General Hospital is always packed, with staff constantly on their feet. People need to understand that the system is stretched, and unnecessary visits only add to the burden.

I experienced a delayed diagnosis, likely because my symptoms seemed routine due to my job. But the pain was affecting my daily life. When I finally got the right treatment, the care I received was more compassionate than I had ever expected even more than what I felt from some colleagues.

Dr. Stanley Angkodjojo and his team in PATU, including nurses Cheryl, Michelle, Khatijah, Fen Fen, Pen Anbu, Xiu Hui, and NC Pua, were truly dedicated. While I was receiving care, they never stopped moving constantly running up and down, checking on me and other patients, never once having the chance to sit. I could hear their concern as they reassured patients, making sure everyone was looked after. Despite their hectic workload, they still took the time to be kind and attentive.

When I visited Dr. Stanley for my appointment, his treatment worked, and my symptoms were finally under control. Life felt normal again.

Sengkang General Hospital,1,"I am writing this review  regarding the unacceptable and unprofessional conduct of one of your staff members, Ms. Lim Qian Hui, who served as the instructor during my recent electric wheelchair training session at SKH.

As a senior citizen with knee joint degeneration and pain, I approached this session with the hope of receiving patient and supportive guidance. Unfortunately, my experience was quite the opposite. Ms. Lim displayed a noticeably short temper, a lack of compassion, and impatience throughout the session. She failed to provide clear instructions, and instead of calmly guiding me, she raised her voice and repeatedly scolded me in a harsh and disrespectful tone.

Her behavior caused me extreme emotional distress. I became frightened, my blood pressure spiked to 192, and I felt dizzy. I was so overwhelmed that I broke down in tears. This was not the first time I encountered such behavior from her ‚Äî during my first visit, she also exhibited the same impatience and unprofessional attitude, even using her mobile phone while instructing me, which made me feel neglected and unsafe.

Although it was a B2 subsidised ward, it didn‚Äôt feel like one at all. We had a great level of privacy, and the environment felt more like a private ward, which was a pleasant surprise.

The staff nurses and doctors on duty throughout the night, morning, and afternoon shifts on the 5th and 6th of April were exceptional. They were caring, professional, sweet, and friendly. The service was fast, efficient, and top notch. I was genuinely impressed by how attentive and responsive everyone was.

Even the food exceeded my expectations especially the Indian meals, which were delicious and comforting.

It was truly a comfortable and reassuring hospital stay. The team attended to my needs quickly and thoroughly, unlike what I‚Äôve experienced in some other well-known hospitals. The doctors and nurses here were clearly experienced and didn‚Äôt just brush things off they listened and acted with genuine care.

Ng Teng Fong General Hospital,1,"Absolutely unacceptable and dangerous experience at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital!

My father was admitted to A&E for UTI and high fever on 14th Aug. He kept telling the nurses for TWO DAYS that he had a fever, was shivering non-stop, and was in obvious pain. Every single time, they waved it off because their thermometer kept showing 36.8¬∞C, claiming the reading was ‚Äúnot far off."" and that their devices were accurate!

It took my father, who was already sick and weak to WALK to the hospital‚Äôs own pharmacy, buy a thermometer himself, and prove his temperature was actually 38.6¬∞C. Only THEN did they realised the thermometer was inaccurate!

This is BASIC patient care ‚Äî if you can‚Äôt even measure temperature accurately or take patient symptoms seriously, how can anyone trust you to handle real emergencies? This kind of negligence is not just sloppy, it‚Äôs dangerous and could cost lives.

Shameful that a major hospital in Singapore allows such incompetence to happen. I hope MOH investigates because this is beyond ridiculous.

2) Can improve on customer service by having a way for patients to update their residential / mailing addresses digitally or through SingPass instead of insisting patients make dedicated trips down to the hospital in person:

National University Hospital,2,"Went to the lumbar and spine clinic for a back pain which I suspected to be a bulging disc. Told the doctor all of my symptoms, saying its a pain that I've had for a long time and feels like it comes from a nerve instead of muscle. Doctor simply wrote it off as a back sprain, gave me physiotherapy and denied me an MRI, saying it was ""protocol"" and I had to come back in 3 months just to finally get the MRI. Not sure why but every time I brought up my back pain it was always dismissed as a sprain...   I even asked the doctor of the possibility of a disc injury and he said the x ray does not show any signs of it (a quick Google search immediately states that X rays can't detect disc damage) I insisted on an MRI as i had back sprains before and this one felt different but the doctor refused to give me an MRI at all.

Got tired of waiting and went to CGH because they were supposedly faster. First consultation there and they immediately gave me an MRI appt and suspected it was something more serious than a mere sprain. 2 months later after the MRI its confirmed to indeed be a bulging disc.

Baffled by this protocol of needing to wait 3 months just to be able to give their patient an MRI... Honestly I'm just gonna go CGH for future issues because these waiting times and lack of concern for their patients is awful.",2025-08-25T07:11:14.587Z,retail

This situation not only causes significant inconvenience but can also pose safety risks and compromise the dignity of patients who rely on wheelchairs for mobility.

The worst point was when he sarcastically asked me, 'So you want MC lah?' Why would I drag myself to the clinic while sick just for an MC? It‚Äôs beyond ridiculous, and I‚Äôm appalled that someone with such poor  manner is still practicing.

To anyone considering a visit: Call ahead to confirm if Dr. Denyse is available. Otherwise, you might end up with a doctor who clearly doesn‚Äôt care about your condition or well-being.",2025-04-14T07:56:36.525Z,Food & Beverage

Honestly, I believe a pharmacist at a drugstore might offer better consultation.

My advice: if Dr. Denyse isn‚Äôt available, it‚Äôs best to come back another day. She‚Äôs the one who carries the clinic‚Äôs reputation‚Äîwithout her, the experience would be significantly worse",2025-04-07T07:17:35.875Z,Food & Beverage

LifeLine Medical Centre,5,"Dr. Tan & Dr. Lee are VERY good GPs with great bedside manners.
Since moving to West Coast in 2008, i have seen them multiple times for various ailments and have never encountered any of the issues that some other people leaving negative reviews claim to have.

After reading some of the negative reviews, i felt it necessary to set the record straight.
Specifically to the posters who gave unjustified negative reviews (that reflect a greater problem with the poster than the clinic), i respond with the following :

1. Instead of having an entitled attitude thinking that the world owes you, maybe you should exercise some common sense and call the clinic to ascertain opening hours before going down like one would do with a restaurant or any other business;

2. A toilet is a toilet - why are you looking down on a more hygienic squatting pan design that doesnt touch your butt amd transfer bacteria to it?
Or are you so 'atas' that you look down on the way we Asians have been doing it for decades?
Maybe you would be more comfortable going back to your birth country since you have no hesitation in insulting Singapore's HDB toilet design history; and

3. Covid is NOT the same as influenza.  While it may present the same symptoms now, if you didnt have the RNA vaccinations that protect against the virus, and you got hit with the Alpha variant, you would likely be dead.  Kindly do not blame the clinic for your lack of understanding of medical protocols.

PanCare Medical,1,"Visited a week ago last Saturday for a UTI and was attended to by a doctor who said she wasn't the main doctor in the clinic. (Can't recall her name.) After doing a urine test, I was told I had only a mild infection and was prescribed just one single dosage of antibiotics.

I thought this was weird, because from what I read online, UTIs require a few days of antibiotics to be treated, but hey, I'm not a doctor, and we all know not to trust what we read online.

Although symptoms subsided after a day, they returned after a few days. I thought I could treat it at home by drinking lots of water to flush out the bacteria, but it only worsened.

Upon visiting the polyclinic today and doing another urine test, I was told I had a very high infection count and the doctor even wanted to send the urine sample for further analysis. This time I was prescribed a week's of antibiotics.

I couldn't help feel and think that I could've avoided the UTI progressing to a more serious stage (and thus a lot of frustration and discomfort) if I had been prescribed with adequate treatment during my first consultation at PanCare Medical Jurong East. The one single dosage of antibiotics also cost me $20, but it's more the issue with what I perceive as receiving inadequate medication to begin with that prompts me to leave this review, especially when I had trusted this clinic with my health after reading many positive reviews here.",2025-03-08T06:51:55.054Z,Arts

The nurses at the clinic are equally exceptional. Despite the number of patients and the queues, they never turn anyone away and always take the time to provide the care and attention needed. It is this unwavering commitment that has been instrumental in helping me recover from numerous bouts of illness.

The doctors and their team have created a sanctuary of healing, where every patient is treated with the utmost respect and kindness. I feel incredibly fortunate to be under their care, and I wholeheartedly recommend the clinic to anyone seeking exceptional medical attention.

Thank you, Dr. Lai, Dr. Pau and their team, for your outstanding service and for making a positive impact on so many lives. You are truly a beacon of hope and healing in the medical community.",2023-11-07T05:55:15.055Z,education

I was having dry eye syndrome and politely requested the doctor for a referral letter to see a specialist. He responded by saying, ‚Äúfor what purpose? Dry eye?‚Äù with a frown and looked confused. I repeated by saying, ‚Äúyes, I have dry eyes for 3 months already and I need a referral letter to see a specialist for my condition because the antibiotic that one of the doctor gave me at this clinic was ineffective.‚Äù Afterwards he told me in a frustrated tone, ‚Äúspecialist? This (Keat Hong Family Clinic) is a private clinic u know, u need to go to polyclinic to get a referral letter from them.‚Äù I told him that I had a referral letter from this clinic before previously. He then asked, ‚Äúu got CHAS card?‚Äù I placed it on the table and he reacted by pushing the CHAS card back to me and said, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt give me, give the counter person.‚Äù

I‚Äôve also never seen this doctor before at this clinic so maybe he‚Äôs new? If yes, I would highly encourage the clinic to recommend him training courses for him to upskill himself or rather, get his character/behaviour right first in order to perform professionally at the workplace.

Can‚Äôt believe I spent $36 just for this horrible consultation experience. Made a feedback through email to the clinic and they reacted by saying that they‚Äôll talk to the doctor only and even reminded me to not take any pictures.

Family Doctors at 365,1,"This clinic is a joke, would recommend to stay away. I've started my 3 dosage HPV vaccine with them.

On my second dose, the vaccine was out of stock islandwide and I had to take a delayed vaccine months later. Fair enough, this is out of their control, I have no complaints.

During my 2nd dose, the doctor explained to me that the delayed dose is not an issue as it was still within the effective period and advised that I take the 3rd dose early Nov - which he explained was X months from the 1st dose.

Early Nov, I called to schedule for a vaccine. The receptionist who took the call explained that they had trouble processing claims when another patient took her 2nd and 3rd dose within a duration too short. The receptionist then advised that I take the dose late Nov instead, which she mentioned was still within the effective period. This itself already raised red flags, it is as if the clinic was willing to risk the effectiveness of a patient's vaccination for the sake of their convenience in claims.

But since it was still within the effectiveness period, I was willing to postpone the jab, to approximately a month later than when the doctor had advised me to.

Fast forward to end Nov, when I contacted the clinic, another receptionist then informed me to take the jab in Jan instead, saying the 3rd dose should be taken 5 months after the 2nd dose.

All in all, the clinic had misinformed me, 3 different sets of information regarding when I should be taking my 3rd dose. I am very unconvinced by the professionalism of the clinic staffs.

I trust Dr Chuang because he goes about his profession with the same beliefs I hold dear to. I am trained to uncover the root cause as an engineer, before designing a solution. As an experienced HR practitioner, I do not prescribe approaches that address symptoms. One easy but wrong way is to throw training at an employee when the harder right is to give him or her the unpleasant but truthful feedback. Few want and dare to do what‚Äôs necessary to help others.

I once asked Dr Chuang why he chose to be a GP when he is a world renowned specialist. He told me he injured his hand and could no longer be a surgeon. He is different from many doctors so many will see him as unorthodox and think he‚Äôs wrong when he‚Äôs not.

Pioneer Medical Centre,1,"I would like to raise a concern regarding my helper‚Äôs experience at your clinic this morning, 27 June 2025.

My helper arrived at the clinic at 7:40 AM, ahead of your opening time at 8:30 AM, in preparation for her scheduled medical checkup. However, once the clinic opened, she was rejected for the checkup and was told she would need to return on Sunday instead.

When my helper called to inform me, she was told the reason for the rejection was that the male doctor on duty could not perform a blood draw for her, and that a female doctor would only be available on Sunday. I found this explanation puzzling, so I called the clinic myself for clarification.

Despite my attempts to understand the situation, I was only told again that the male doctor cannot take her blood, with no valid explanation provided. I even asked whether the doctor was a trainee (which could explain certain limitations), but was told he was not. I also asked whether a nurse could perform the blood draw, and was informed that the clinic does not have a nurse.

I find this situation extremely frustrating. My helper waited nearly an hour outside the clinic, only to be turned away and asked to return two days later. This feels both inefficient and inconsiderate, especially since no prior notice was given about the limitations of your staff or service.

I would appreciate it if someone could explain why this happened, and more importantly, advise where I can escalate this feedback so that other patients do not face similar experiences in the future.

Thank you for your attention, and I hope to receive a proper explanation soon.",2025-06-27T01:04:11.310Z,Arts

Pioneer Medical Centre,2,"My family and I have been visiting this clinic for years. We understand that the waiting time is long but we were ok with it, as long as we are able to get treated. The doctors are generally nice, patient and thorough when we consult them. The counter staff were ok in general. However, my recent experience in this clinic was disappointing. The counter staff was extremely rude and impatience. I politely asked a question about collection of medication (we waited for at least 20-30 mins already but still not called upon to collect) but received the following unpleasant responses:
- Wait... Can you wait? Wait for few minutes... Just wait...
- I am very busy. You just have to wait... Doctor still need to XXX
- Doctor, can you XXX, the patients are complaining already
We understand that the counter staff may be busy (by the way there are 2 counter staff). As patients/family members, we do not want to make things difficult for the staff. What we wanted from the counter staff was that our responses to be answered politely, and be respected. I sat inside the clinic and observed that this counter lady, for every question that patients asked, her responses would be very hostile and rude, and unpleasant. One patient claimed that he was asked to come down to the clinic at 10.30am, but this counter rudely responded ""No, I did not said that (x2)"". The patient left the clinic, probably feeling why he was treated that unpleasant way when he was already sick.

All in all, doctors are good, but the system in terms of registration and medication collection needs to be improved. What is more important is, the counter staff (working on 26 Dec morning), needs to work the way she responds to patients. If every patients that asked you a question and you need to be so reactive, defensive, hostile and rude, then the problem lies with herself. She is busy, the clinic is busy, but so are we.

This is my third time visiting this clinic. This is close to my home, so I come back here. Except for the doctor's diagnosis, everything else is very bad.

Alas, if you need to wait for a long time, you can inform the patient in advance. Today I came to see a doctor. There were only three people waiting, but I still waited for more than an hour before it was my turn to see a doctor. It's really ridiculously slow and a waste of time. Inefficient.

SATA CommHealth Jurong Medical Centre,1,"I visited this clinic in late June on a late afternoon with only one or two other patients.

Despite having almost no waiting line or crowds, the patient service staff was downright terrible and disorganised. The staff members were disrespectful with questions and laughed at me when I asked them about the next counter to go to after receiving zero directions prior.

The doctor was kind and professional and made a great specialist referral. However, my referral was NOT submitted by their staff members and the clinic's hotline printed on the referral slip was not in service.

Not surprisingly, when I called NUH days after not seeing my appointment in Health Hub, I was informed by NUH that the referral appointment had not been submitted. This was completely unprofessional and spoke volumes about the low service and post-consultation standards of this clinic.

The NUH appointment hotline, on the other hand, was able to fix an appointment right over the phone to secure my appointment all within ten minutes.

I felt really angry and told her the high reading was due to the pain when the cuff inflate. The nurse cannot be bothered. In the end I was told to buy a cuff BP Monitor to record my readings for 5 days.

Teehee Dental Works,1,"Dr. Seet Shi Ming displayed an alarming lack of professionalism and competence. Without even taking a 3D X-ray, she hastily and irresponsibly concluded that my molar that is sensitive to hot and cold needed a root canal.

Any careful dentist would have conducted a thorough assessment, yet she skipped critical diagnostic steps.

I chose a conservative filling instead, but after the procedure, the tooth became even more sensitive. Rather than acknowledging any mistake, she confidently and repeatedly assured me that she could ‚Äúfix‚Äù it by drilling through my existing crown, performing the root canal, and sealing the crown back in place. I trusted her and planned to proceed‚Äîonly to be abruptly told later that their clinic could not perform the procedure at all and could only refer me to a specialist.

I attended to my 3 month long wait Endoscopy appointment with was refered by Ng Teng Fong General Hospital. I had a running nose yesterday which I told the guy who contacted me . This morning it started to cough. Actually I wanted to cancel off but when I thought of the 5 torturing days of preparation work for the scopy check . I just don't want to give up so easily. I want to get an opinion from the physican.

The lady staff after confirming my identity ask me is there any people bringing me back. I told her no. She say that because some guy after the check fainted on the road, so the physican are very strict on this. He might not want to do for me. I insisted I'm alone. Then she say that she will let the physican to decide.

After more then 40 minutes of waiting, the physican's nurse came to see me. Telling me the physican is not going to sedate me ask me is it ok. I told him whether can or cannot should me on the physican.

After he left, I started to think something unusual. I had an appointment with Ng Teng Fong General Hospital last year September with they rejected me base on my heart problem because  they need to give me sedation for my scopy check. I spend 6 months to look for a heart physican to justify my heart condition then they accepted me.

Now this guy say he can do without sedation. Then why can't Ng Teng Fong physican also do that without sedation. Instead of wasting  my 6 month finding a heart physican.

I'm not worry about nobody bringing me back I'm more worry on my cough but till now I still have no chance to see that physican.

More and more Singaporean like to live alone. Is already a trench. There are so my doctorate people in the centre and yet they can't think of a way to solve the problem. Instead of insisting someone to bring back the patient or goes without sedation.

Level 3, Clinic G, Dr Aziz Nather, Room 42. Rude, unprofessional, no signs of care or concern with a very stuck up attitude.

First, when I entered the room, no greeting. Just siting there with a ""like a boss"" position. Didn't even say ""Hello"" or  ask ""How can I help?"" Nothing. Just wait for me to talk.

See..
I've been having knee discomfort for past 6 months. Checks from polyclinic and Xray shows nothing wrong but it's been 6 months and everyday I will feel pain whenever I stand up, exert force, squat or run.

This doctor here did a 1 min check, same check as doctors in polyclinic when I hope that there can be a more extensive check like squatting, MRI or ultrasound. But he just feel a bit here and there, and I say no pain he say he can't do anything as there is nothing wrong.

I argued to say, what about my pain that I feel everyday? To which he says ""There is no cure to your pain. You have to do your normal activities and overcome the pain."" Whole consultation lasted less than 5 minutes.

What is this? I am here to find out the root cause of my pain and see what I can do about this. But this is the unprofessional thrash service that I am getting? For 5 mins consultation, I am charged $30+?

Jurong Medical Centre,1,"FIRST HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE WITH DOCS

Bought my grandma to JMC (Jurong Medical Clinic) today, staffs are very unprofessional. E.g my grandma and i are chinese, the Malay staff, with respect, get me to ask my grandma 6 questions. I believe that it is her job to consult my grandma while i will translate beside her. What‚Äôs more ridiculous is that she always disrupt my interactions with my grandma while i ask her that 6 qns.

After that she bought my grandma to measure her blood pressure, once again the staffs were unprofessional, they spoke in Malay in front of us that sounded very rude and they repeatedly speaking louder and louder at her to move forward. Unfortunately, they still couldn‚Äôt measure her blood pressure successfully with the latest technology. Ended up using the old device that all students use in school.

When it comes to measure her H&W, a staff assisted her to measure, afterwards another staff asked her to measure again. What‚Äôs funny that after i told the second staff that re-measure she push the blame at the first staff as ‚Äú didn‚Äôt told her that she already measured ‚Äú. Look clearly at this communication within staffs‚Ä¶

Follow up, the doctor that assisted us, he gave me suggestions to choose between surgery or medication and ofc brainwashing me that surgery is a tougher way. Me being myself ofc ik that surgery might bring more pain to my 85 y/o grandma and I believe medication is best for her now. He randomly check her heart beat, type computer and gave us a paper to collect medicine.

Lastly, i asked him whether the previous medicines should still be used for my grandma and whether my grandma should stop ingesting those meds, he just gives me a unclear ans and ask me to proceed to collect meds at level 1‚Ä¶ what a horrible experience in Singapore‚Ä¶",2024-02-26T03:23:18.288Z,Arts

TWC Implant & Dental Center (Jurong East),5,"After researching for a while, I discovered TWC. Previously, I had done Invisalign and other dental care at a chain clinic with multiple outlets, but over time, long waits, inconsistent service, and unexpected charges left me frustrated and eventually made me stop visiting. (I also brought my elderly family members there for dentures, but unresolved issues and lack of support from the previous clinic‚Äôs dentist caused them to give up and continue using their broken dentures. :( )

I decided to try TWC after reading many positive reviews and was genuinely impressed. Dr. Lai and the nurses were patient and thorough throughout. I remade my retainer here; while the price is a bit higher, the quality and service are excellent. The retainer even comes with a warranty and lasted several months‚Äîunlike my previous one from another clinic that started breaking apart after just two weeks.

Overall, I highly recommend TWC to anyone seeking reliable and attentive dental care. I hope the clinic continues to maintain this high standard. Cheers!",2025-07-05T11:03:04.150Z,Retail

However, the front desk service leaves much to be desired. While waiting, I witnessed a very sick patient being ignored by the older assistant (as mentioned in other reviews too). She literally walked away while the patient pleaded for help ‚Äî completely unprofessional and unacceptable behavior, especially in a healthcare setting.

After my consultation, I was told I could only get part of the prescribed medication due to a cap under company insurance. I was still paying partially, yet could only get meds for one issue (diarrhea), not the sore throat. I‚Äôve never encountered a clinic that withholds necessary meds like this without a clear explanation.

This is my second visit, and both times I left with a poor impression due to the same staff member.

Unprofessional clinic assistant. (Lady with thick & weird tatooed eyebrows). I came in at 8.35pm on 21 April 2025 and was told by the elderly clinic assistant that its closed. I told her it's not even close to 9pm yet. Plead my case coz i just got off from work. Then being told off by this thick eyebrowed clinic assistant on why did i came late, if she accept im the last patient she will go home late coz she also got family. Then came the worst part. Ask me if im under company clinic which i replied yes. She added some more you never pay, i still need to key in all the details for you and will cause her to go home late if she accept me as last patient. Im not sure if she knows every visit i still have to pay, the difference is being deducted via my payslip. What kind of stupid and unprofessional comment is this.

I smiled and then left, writing this review in another professional clinic. My family of 5 has been a regular at Dr Ben's clinic. Even my elderly mother in law that lives in Yishun came here for her calcium injection regularly despite paying a premium coz of Dr Ben. But because of one clinic assistant ignorant attitude, this will be the last and final visit from my whole family.

Unprofessional clinic assistant/ nurse. Not even close to closing time, when i left the clinic being rejected, it was 8.35pm. Don't need to give excuse company panel gives u more paperwork, that's your job. I will recommend my parkway panel insurance company to review the huge paperwork that you need to do. Infact, don't be a panel provider if you can't handle it. I appreciate you have a family and need family time but that's between you and ur employer. And my final advice to this lady is to smile.

Since the start of the year i've visited this clinic multiple times due to my kids illness, this lady facial expression leaves alot to be desired. Not friendly and leaves a bad fengshui to the clinic. Wishing you all the best Dr Ben and Martin. You lost my family services and those that i recommended will be duly notified. I guess im not the only person to comment on ur nurses, see screenshot.

The doctor's advice to switch to a softer toothbrush was spot on, and the filling procedure for my 3 teeth was done with precision and care. I'm now sensitivity-free, and I'm so grateful for the doctor's expertise.

Dr Koh did a very rushed job - with all the services i was out in 15minutes having been charged over 300 dollars. Very little was done to assuage the gum infection which was causing the toothache (eg unlike other dentists who will try to flush out the impacted area etc as i have experienced before). Had to remind him on this before he just went in with some polishing tool.

Q & M Dental Surgery,2,"First time visiting this clinic and also first time visiting Q&M in general for routine dental procedure (scaling and polishing). Left pretty disappointed due to the following reasons

- As a first-time patron of this clinic, I would have expected the dentist to spend more time to assess the condition of my teeth, since they have no prior records. Dentist went straight into the procedure without any assessment done.

- The scaling and polishing procedure took < 15 mins. The whole session feels extremely rushed and brief. This is despite me informing the dentist that my last scaling was > 1 year ago . All my prior experiences with other clinics usually take about 30mins at the least.

All in all, I left feeling disappointed and questionable on whether my teeth was checked properly, or even cleaned properly, which is exacerbated by the fact that clinic has such great google reviews. Not sure if this is common standard across this franchise or just my luck that the dentist that attended to me didnt seem too invested in the work.

In particular, Dr Natalie is incredibly meticulous and presents a level of attentiveness and care that reflects her passion and high expertise. I usually dread the biyearly cleaning sessions when it comes to the average dentist, however, Dr Natalie's assuring demeanour, constant check-ins and technical grasp provides a pain-free and fast experience. When she was making my retainers (which previously broke due to my bruxism / teeth grinding), she took put in time and effort, going above and beyond to specially tune my retainer to maximise my comfort and retainer lifespan (i think the lifespan of my retainer has almost tripled or more). She listens attentively and explains everything as needed and appropriate. I would believe that this standard of service is the ideal highest benchmark for all healthcare staff throughout all fields and specialities, albeit we must also acknowledge and respect the struggles and difficulties that come with being in the healthcare industry.

mydental @ Taman Jurong,5,"A big big thank you to Dr Eow and staff for their patience and expertise throughout my entire braces journey.  The staff here are really friendly and it's a very comforting vibe everytime you enter the place.

Oh and you don't have to worry about forgetting your appointment dates as they'll send friendly reminders on WhatsApp which I thought was great. This makes it easy to contact them on any enquiries, and they're super responsive as well so you're in great hands.

Dr Eow's really swift and meticulous with her checks, and the whole clinic's really clean and hygienic while being cosy. Prior to coming to mydental@tamanjurong, I was quite apprehensive of coming to the dentist because I'd always thought it would be really difficult to have braces on teeth that had root canal treatment following a fall, but Dr Eow was up for the challenge and I'm so grateful for all her efforts over these few years. I'm glad to say that I'm finally able to bite an apple and chew with my teeth instead of cutting food into smaller pieces.  And yep, having a great smile now after correcting my overbite has been the icing on the cake!

So thank you all soo sooooo much! Oh, and if any of you reading this are still on the fence on whether to visit this clinic , I'll say give it a try, and I hope you'll enjoy your visit and be as pleased as I am with the service.

MY Clinic,1,"I only used this clinic because they were the only ones in my neighbourhood on my corporate insurance panel.  Pretty average standard level of expertise for GPs. The doctors there are friendly enough, although the clinic always looked messy.

I opted to use them for Healthier SG programme, after the lead GP sold me a very nice pitch. that was in Dec 2023.  I was also encouraged to email them, which i did. I sent an email on 2 Jan 2024, which went on to be unanswered for MONTHS.  Follow up emails and even phone calls were unanswered and when I finally managed to get through, it was already 19 July 2023.  All i got from the receptionist Lavina was ""did you?"" when I told her about the email.

So apparently no one checks the only email account of the clinic but Lavina. Either that, my email is not deemed important enough to open.  In the end, my treatment was kept in status quo and I didnt start my HSG programme till much later.

When queried, all i got was a very insincere ""As spoken on the phone on 20 July 2024, we have conveyed our apologies and we are again sorry to hear of the cost concerns with your specialist"", without the lead GP even acknowleging that his team messed up and dropped the ball on me. The fact that my emails and calls were unanswered for more than 7 months was the MAIN ISSUE, which the clinic didnt want to address. I am pretty sure if i hadnt called, it would have gone on to remain unanswered.

I was told in an email on 22 July 2024 that the delay was due to the clinic having to ""clarify a few things with ALPs and AIC as to the drugs eligible under HSG"". It must have been arduous, having to require more than 7 months.

I have since enrolled with another clinic for HSG. They are further away from my home, but at least the Physician there follows up on me regularly.  I feel very cared for by my new Physician, who clearly is invested in my welbeing.  I guess when you put patient's needs before monetary gains, this will happen.

Sometimes, it is better to just admit mistakes and not deny making them.",2024-09-08T05:00:28.202Z,education

Without his skill, attention, and personal care I wouldn‚Äôt be here to write this review. And Dr. Pang was also one of my physicians. Both of these gentlemen were and are two of the finest diagnosticians I have ever encountered anywhere in the world.

AllSmiles Dental Care Plus,5,"Legit the best dental experience I‚Äôve ever had in my entire life. For those who have a fear of the dentist, read on:

I have a childhood trauma of going to the dentist from primary school. Since then I only visit dentist when I really can‚Äôt tahan anymore. Doesn‚Äôt help that my wisdom tooth extractions years later was also very bad and traumatic (back then I screamed in the chair when I realized I could still feel pain as the dentist started pulling at my teeth - literal nightmare played out in real life).

But as I explained to the clinic my super fear of the dentist, they were very assuring and accommodating to my situation. They took special note of my situation, and right from the reception nurse at registration (sorry I didn‚Äôt get your name) to the doctor doing the procedure and even the assistant were very gentle and assuring to me. Doctor Russell explained every step of the way for me, what he will do, what I should expect and feel, and made sure to check that I didn‚Äôt feel anything before starting and even throughout the procedure. In no way did I feel intimidated by the procedure, throughout Dr Russell was very friendly and even joking with me to ease my anxiety. He was also very encouraging like I was a kid (not condescendingly or sarcastically, mind you) but you know what, it was actually what I needed to distract me from my fear and anxiety. Genuinely helped me.

Health Check at Raffles Hospital,1,"1. Doctor issued false information repeatedly which would not have been corrected if I did not press the issue:

Appalling experience with a doctor who repeatedly denied the existence of a tripartite advisory regarding medical records and job applications even though this clinic supposedly processes hundreds of pre-employment check-ups every week. When I persisted in clarifying the issue, he became even ruder and more condescending instead of checking with his colleagues. Some of his choice words included, ""Well I am the doctor here, so I think I should know better.""

It turned out later that the advisory does exist. He did not even acknowledge his mistake, but instead continued to be even more rude.

2. Multiple potential breaches of confidentiality:
Afterwards, he also did not ask for my consent to have additional personnel present when another doctor walked in unannounced while we were discussion confidential matters about my medical history. Beyond that, he also instructed me to explain the situation myself to the admin staff outside, even though the clinic waiting room is a semi-public space and was packed full of members of the public at the time. (By the way I had to re-queue all over again for this)

3. Doctor has unprofessional behavior:
Doctor was rude and dismissive throughout our exchanges. Moreover, whenever I attempted to ask reasonable clarifying questions, he responded with clear impatience and disrespect.

Later, upon complaining about this incident to my close friends, one of them shared that their knew of this doctor personally and showed their publicly-viewable instagram profile to me. There they openly brand themselves as a doctor + lifestyle influencer and their content is mostly half-naked photos of themselves.  I think this pretty much sums up how much seriousness and respect they have for the medical profession and what they prioritize over being competent. I don't know what kind of reputation the hospital is trying to uphold with employees like this.

4. No response from Raffles Hospital

I sent several complaints to the hospital over 2 weeks ago and have not even gotten a simple response acknowledging that they have received my feedback and are looking into the matter. This is very disappointing as doctors should not be distributing medical misinformation and breach of confidentiality is a serious issue.

Because of this I have reached out to MOM, MOH, TAFEP, and will consider further actions. Reading the reviews here, it is clear that many people have had horrible experiences at this clinic for a long time. What kind of clinic has ""humiliating"" as a tag under its reviews..

5. Misc

I had initially booked the test with another provider but was having issues with that booking, thankfully I found Dedicare and they were very helpful from start to finish ‚Äî from WhatsApp, to the in-clinic session and even follow-up to make sure I got all the paperwork I needed for my pre-departure PCR results, even though the next day was the clinic's (and staff's) off day.

Although I don't stay in Hougang, this feels like a very warm and friendly clinic at the void deck of a Hougang block. Worth my 1.5h commute (back and forth)!

I visited this clinic on 19 May 2025 for diarrhea/stomach flu, and the experience was very disappointing. The consultation was brief, but I was shocked when the final bill came up to $150++, despite using my company medical panel.

The doctor prescribed 7 types of medicine, some of which were clearly unnecessary ‚Äî like paracetamol, which I specifically said I didn‚Äôt need. The counter staff insisted I take it because the doctor had prescribed it, leaving me no choice.

Even worse, when I checked my claim later on the MyHealthWallet app, I saw that the doctor had listed symptoms I never had, just to justify the claim. When I called the clinic to clarify, the doctor stood by the false diagnosis and even asked me to come back to collect more medicine they ‚Äúforgot‚Äù to give earlier.

GP@JOO CHIAT CLINIC,5,"Kudos to GP@Joo Chiat Clinic. Have to Kudos first as I m afraid viewers will miss out this 'bouquet' and scroll passed the compliments.

Thank you Shu Yi my first point of contact and to Dr Jan, unexpected msg despite I actually retract the consultation.üôèüôèüôèüôè

Like all frantic family members of an unwell person at home, we urgently scrolled thru Google looking for housecall doctors which seemed not a lot esp if location is a consideration
Next I scrolled reviews which is important, Dr Jan's mention came in so very often, still I m very focussed on service..so location ok, 5 *..
I proceeded to call clinic, Shu Yi was the soft spoken, calm and courteous lady who took my call, went thru a short exchange and my queries were answered. She sent me a watsapp to fill in some details..
Still called her again to ascertain some issues..finally all done, forwarded the watsapp, booked the Doctor.
Then mum came up with some issues, thus family decided that we change course and will send mum to hosp.

That means I will have to withdraw the booking I had with GP@Joo Chiat.
Without hassle I was withdrawn from the booking as Shu Yi handled it with shere professionalism.
Especially the doc is so busy..Shu Yi with pure understanding and compassion, wish my mum well. Felt wow..such nice deposition in health care serviceüëèüëèüëèüëè

Went about booking ambulance, settling mum in and barely have time to see other msgs on hp.

Dr Jan from this clinic sent a warm msg :

Ms Isabelle. Dr Jan here. Hope your mum recovers quickly. Thank you for choosing us.

I was just overwhelmed by this msg..despite not even engaging their service.
(more warm msg which I m not sharing)

Such rare Gem like many of his patients reviewed. Thank you so much Dr Jan and team at GP@Joo Chiat.

I shall remember this clinic very well.

He is very polite, detailed and knowledgeable while being very particular tackling your illness whether it‚Äôs a concurrent or chronic illness.

When I sounded out my discomfort with drowsy medicine, he also walked me through which kind of medicine should be taken and when to take them.

He is also very honest to the price of the overall bill, ensuring the medicines are necessary before adding onto the bill.

GP@JOO CHIAT CLINIC,1,"Called in the morning to make a vaccination appointment that night 7pm. Staff said she would check with the doctor and get back but did not. I called again at 730pm to follow up. Staff said she would check with the doctor for any possible apptmt slots the next day and get back, but did not. I provided feedback to the clinic via WhatsApp that night, stating that if there were no available slots then appreciate if they can let me know so that I can enquire with other clinics. I believe my request was not unreasonable and is basic courtesy. Dr Jan replied personally,  saying that (1) he had ‚Äúvery little time‚Äù to read my feedback; and (2) they have a long waiting list and no vaccine stock. Dr Jan, in case it is not clear enough, the issue is the lack of follow up from your clinic on my request as promised - if there was no stock, you could have just informed me simply over the phone. I have patronised this clinic many times so this service lapse is very disappointing, not to mention the patronising reply from Dr Jan.

Edit - Your response does not make sense. I am entitled to give my feedback in public on your service, life threatening or otherwise. As per your logic, why don‚Äôt you ask other reviewers to take their good feedback private since it is not life threatening or emergency-related?  I have been balanced in my review.

GP@JOO CHIAT CLINIC,5,"Long overdue review of Dr Jan and my experience at Joo Chiat GP.
As part of Healthier SG program, I had to appoint a GP Clinic but the ones nearer to my home are already full. This clinic is new and have vacancy for my enrolment.
Initial consultation was detailed to outline broad goals and I had to do some tests. After the tests we did the review.
Dr Jan was frank and open in his approach to get me to make active choices about my health. Some medication was issued but what impressed me of the whole experience was the level of care that Dr Jan and team have delivered.
I've since dropped 8 kg in 3 months, have less mobility concerns and feel more energetic/ alert.
I wished I got to know Dr Jan earlier as this is what all family doctors suppose to do; pre-emptive care and communications.
Direct cost of consultation and medication are affordable and definitely cheaper than some of the other chain clinics I used to visit.",2025-01-24T16:13:44.819Z,Hotels

Healthwerkz Medical Centre,3,"Bad attitude from Doctor Gerald Chong on Monday (8 May 2023).

I went down on Saturday (6 May) with the intentions to get the basic $5 health screening check up (from Health Hub app). When I went to the clinic, both staff at the counter said that they were temp staff and are unable to access the portal to check whether I am eligible for the $5 health screening check up. I proceeded to show my Health Hub message that confirmed that I am eligible. However, they said only weekday staff can access the portal and told me to come back on a weekday to check.

So the following Monday (8 May), I went down and the permanent staff already checked with the doctor and system that I am eligible for the test. I said I would return on Saturday to do the test instead since I would need to fast for the screening too.

However, the doctor on duty on Monday, Gerald Chong told me to come on a weekday instead because the temporary clinic staff on Saturday do not know how to submit the form for the health screening. He was rude and brushed me off and said there was no choice because the temp staff do not know the procedure and told me to go another clinic as he can‚Äôt help. I asked if he could get the permanent staff to help with the form beforehand on a weekday before I get the health screening on a Saturday. However, he continued to brush me off and repeatedly said that I should just go to another clinic instead before walking back into the room without hearing my response.

His condescending tone and words rubbed me in the wrong way, especially when other staff and I have been communicating in a cordial manner before that. Asking people to just go to another clinic instead also feels like an irresponsible act. I will not ever visit this clinic again if Gerald Chong is on duty. In contrast, Doctor Goh is a friendly and knowledgable doctor at this clinic every time he is on duty.

Additionally, I do not understand why the clinic is even open on Saturday if the temp staff present on weekends have no experience and are unable to submit forms or other procedures,

In general, this clinic also refuses patients before their official closing time. For instance, the opening hours are stated as 6-9pm but they would already start refusing patients when it‚Äôs only 8+pm and even when there are no patients inside waiting.",2023-05-13T03:12:23.560Z,Food & Beverage

I visited this clinic today for a prescription refill of antihistamines to manage my chronic eczema. I was subjected to the WORST consultation of my life.

Doctor Tay Jun Sheng  shouted at me and aggressively questioned why I don‚Äôt just use steroid cream.

(This is medically inaccurate) ‚Äì many eczema patients rely on non-steroidal strategies (like antihistamines and moisturizers) due to steroid complications.

His attitude was condescending, rude, and unprofessional. He showed zero understanding of eczema management beyond outdated steroid reliance, ignored my lived experience with the condition, and made me feel blamed for my own symptoms.

AVOID this clinic if:
- You expect doctors to listen to patients.

I like that DR gets to the root of the issue effectively and efficiently so that it will not take patients too much waiting time esp when theres a queue outside.

I was also bleeding and struggled in discomfort while the doctor still insist to collect the specimen, while it was actually nothing serious.

After a few days, i went back to the clinic to take the report and as per normal, they still need to extra charge for consultation to review the report.

i.Dental - Dental Clinic in Yishun,1,"One receptionist's unprofessionalism is really no joke. When I booked for the second braces consultation one year after I deciced not to do it, she asked me why I want to do braces now after I decided not to proceed last year. This is a valid question, and I had my reasons which are super valid too. So, I answered. But she went on to say below things to me which I find very unprofessional and make the organization she is working for look SO BAD!
1) she said I must make sure that I want to do braces, then only she will book doctor consultation for me (excuse me, do I need to sign the paper that says I will do braces no matter what even before I go in for the consultation?)

2) ask me to imagine if every patient is like me who will book consultation but dont do braces later on. Told me that I am wasting doctor's time. (Excuse me! I am PAYING FOR MY CONSULATION. The doctor is not doing it for free.)

3) I said if you don't want to accept my booking, you don't have to. I will just go to another clinic which she replied to me that every doctor will tell you the same thing, and this problem (of me not doing braces after consultation and wasting doctor's time) will follow no matter which clinic I go.

4) (This is the worst part) She said their clinic isn't afraid to lose one customer. They can survive with one less customer.

I had the shock of my life after talking to her on phone. This is not how you should treat your customer. I am paying for all your services. No one deserves to be treated like a second class just because I cancelled an appointment in the past and didn't proceed to do the braces after consultation. Whether I do braces or not is ultimately my decision. Not hers.

Nuffield Dental | Dentist @ Seletar,1,"I was a patient at Nuffield Dental Greenwich branch. The dentist who re-crown my incisor arranged an appointment for me at their Wheelock branch, ostensibly to choose a colour for my crown. When I went to Wheelock, the receptionist told me that no appointment has been made for me. As I was already there, I insisted to be attended to. A Malay/muslim lab technician came and we went through the selection. I chose a grade 3 but he brushed me aside and told me he will take a 3.5. I thought that he knew better and trusted him. During the session, I saw another Malay/Muslim man in another room laughing away. I dismissed it.

The dentist fixed the 3.5 crown and after some time, it sticks out like a sore thumb. I went back in July 2024 and insisted on changing it to 3. This time, the dentist brought the samples to the clinic. I chose the shade I had initially chosen- a 3.

On my return trip to fix a temporary crown, 2 chicken rice sellers at Greenwich foodcourt,  one male and the other female walked into the room. The male chicken rice seller stayed on to assist the dentist. I told them not to fixed a temporary crown that is too white as I have to wait another 14 days before I get the permanent crown. Instead they purposely fixed a temporary crown which was very very white. It is clear that the 2 of them was out to purposely to make a spectacle of me! At that time, the 2 chicken rice sellers were masked up and I thought that they were qualified nurses.

When I send them the photo of the female chicken rice seller, the dentist immediately told me that the permanent crown is ready. And I can go back immediately to fix it.

It was over the weekend and I delivered 2 letters of complaint to the receptionist who was actually the male chicken rice seller.

The Director of operations met me on Monday, 25 July 2024, and I insisted he sat in. The dentist fixed the permanent crown and told me that it was glued with temporary cement. And if the crown loosens to go back and he will glue with permanent cement.

This dentist is obviously lying to me. In fact he had glued the permanent crown with permanent cement.

After Nufflied‚Äôs refusal to settle the matter privately with me, I reported to the police and they investigated.

I had a dispute with the Malay/Muslims in my previous condo and that was the reason why I moved house to Yio Chue Kang. But for a professional dentist to collude with them to ridicule me is very very unprofessional and a serious breach of professional conduct.

I spent a total of about $3K including a splint. I will certainly lodge a complaint against the dentist.

The Receptionists also brings gossip into the office and breaches patient confidentiality.

The conduct of the clinic in allowing a chicken rice seller to assist a dentist is reprehensible and is a professional misconduct. I do not know the dentist nor any of the Muslim chicken  rice sellers at all.

I will certainly lodge a formal complaint to the medical council against the dentist, Dr Robin Zhang.

I have read their response and wish to add that there was no full and final settlement of the matter. I agree to accept the replaced crown as it is the colour shade I had chose but this doesn‚Äôt excuse Dr Robin Zhang and Nuffield‚Äôs  misconduct in allowing untrained personnel to pose as lab technician and nurse to assist Dr Zhang in the treatment room. Their intention is to make a joke and a spectacle out of me!

Now I recognised the female chicken rice stall holder- she is Lena who was the cleaner in my previous condo. She threw soiled tissue paper outside my opposite Arab neighbour unit which has caused serious disputes between my Arab neighbour and I. She also released a rat into my unit to force me to move out, not to mention threw dead birds into my patio/plastic and dead leaves into my patio in the days before I moved out. She and her lover (who was her supervisor) were asked to leave. She followed me here to take revenge.

I am surprised a dentist like Dr Zhang would see fit to further her personal vendetta.",2025-08-18T10:04:37.427Z,Arts
Nuffield Dental | Dentist @ Seletar,5,"I was supposed to have an appointment with Bliss Dental at Hougang One, but a day before, I was informed the dentist went for reservist. This seems to be a common issue if you read their Google reviews (score 2.3 from 69 reviews).

I searched for a nearby dentist and found Nuffield Dental, which had excellent reviews (score 4.8 from 285 reviews). When Nuffield says your appointment is at 11 am, they mean it ‚Äî no long waits. The lobby is spacious, clean, and doesn‚Äôt give that claustrophobic feeling. In the operating room, there‚Äôs even a TV on the ceiling playing an animal channel to help distract anxious patients.

Dr. Robin was extremely professional, unlike the ‚Äúya-ya ah-beng‚Äù dentist I encountered at Bliss Dental. Dr. Robin waited for the anesthesia to fully take effect before removing my tooth ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt feel a thing.

Started contacting several 24hr house visit doctors. None picked up my calls except Dr Chua (see photo) 'The Mobile Doctor' thankfully. It was past 2300 hours. He was very patient and assessed my condition carefully. Despite my agony, his voice gave me a sense of calm as he went through my health condition step by step and gave his views on the current meds I was taking (for other health conditions) so as to narrow down what was wrong with me. As I had already taken different types of painkillers from Buscopan to Arcoxia to Cellebrex to relieve the pain, I was concerned with OD. I think he managed to pin point the cause and advised me accordingly over the phone on what further meds I can or cannot take to avoid overdosing.

When collecting the medications, there was no dosing spoon for liquid medicine until I asked for it, the nurse simply passed me a cup & didn't bother to explain the spoon wasn't  available, hence, replaced with a cup.

Norwood Medical Clinic,1,"I have been frequenting Norwood Medical for about 6 years now. Experience with the receptionist is not great as mentioned by everyone else. However, Dr Neoh has been very helpful in treating us and prescribing us with effective medications. On 20 March, I registered myself at 11am to be seen by a locum doctor. After waiting for 45 mins, which is rather unusual, the doctor informs us that there is an emergency and they have to immediately close the clinic stranding all the patients that have been waiting. Understand that the particular patient was suspected to have a heart attack. Working in the healthcare industry, I can fully comprehend the urgency of the situation, however, i cannot understand why the clinic has to be closed immediately, ditching the other patients who have been already registered. My understanding is, the clinic should be activating the ambulance and wait for the paramedics to arrive. Thus, is there a need to IMMEDIATELY CLOSE the clinic? The patient was still fully conscious, was mobile and able to speak.

Thankfully EH Medical was open and accepting patients.",2024-03-20T04:19:00.375Z,Retail

During the X-ray, I was asked to bite down on the sensor without any plastic covering ‚Äî just bare rubber. This raised hygiene concerns for me, as I expected proper disposable barriers to be used between patients. The dentist and assistant also had no hairnets and they were cleaning my teeth with their hair directly above my mouth...
Additionally, the cleaning and polishing felt excessively rough and painful, unlike my experiences with other dentists. It was difficult to stay relaxed throughout the procedure.

When the receptionist showed me the medicine's i realized that one of the medicine i got it at my home. So i told them i think i don't need this practical medicine as i have already got it. And the doctor came out from his room and told me ""If you know that you have this medicine, u could have told me earlier right, now my manpower has been wasted."" I replied to him saying that as as patient i only know that u are providing me with medicine. How will i know what medicine, how does the medicine even look like? This doctor is so ridiculous, his not professional for his work. My question here is, how will a patient know what medicine is the doctor going to provide? Until we are going to make the payment that's where we will look through the medications. How am i to tell him in advance that i dont need the medicine. And also i have went to so many clinics in Singapore, never once i have encountered a situation like this. No clinics have rejected our request when we tell them that we already have this medicine with us, so i dont need this now. All i know is they will take the medication from us and only charge us for the rest of the medicine they provide. Payment wise, this is not acceptable. I have ever paid consultation fee of $16 at other clinics. And their medicine will be strong & i will recover.

Luminous Dental (Yishun) - Invisalign & Dental Implants in Singapore,1,"Very disappointing and frustrating experience
During my first appointment with the clinic, I arrived 15 minutes early for my scheduled appointment at 730 pm, yet I was not attended to until 750 pm. It was informed that Dr Kayla's previous appointment had overrun.
When I made the appointment, I informed that I would like to do fillings, cleaning, and a consultation regarding braces. However, during the session, Dr Kayla focused mainly on recommending braces and only performed one filling, even though I had informed that other services would be required. When I asked if we could complete the second filling during this visit and I do not mind postponing the cleaning to next session, Dr Kayla stated there was not enough time, which was surprising to me. I have never been to a dentist appointment that only allows for one filling, especially when I make the appointment, I had already informed that I would need to do multiple services, and nothing was informed to me that this would not be possible. I also can‚Äôt help thinking that if her previous appointment overruns, she should not compromise my appointment.
After the first appointment, I scheduled a follow-up session for the second filling, cleaning and braces consultation. The receptionist confirmed with me again that I would be able to perform all these services in one session. In addition, to be able to schedule an appointment fast, I was recommended to schedule an afternoon session in which I did. I then took leave to come for my second appointment.
However, when I arrived for the second appointment, I was told that the appointment had not been booked. It was also informed that the clinic does not send text or whatsapp reminders and they only confirm appointments via phone calls. So, moving forward, if I miss their call, I won‚Äôt be able to verify that the appointment was made unless I call them every time before I go.
This entire experience left me feeling as though my time was not valued. It seems that only the dentist's time is considered important. I had to take time off work for an afternoon appointment, and this lack of organization and lack of respect for my time really caused unnecessary inconvenience. If you are looking for a clinic that values your time and provides efficient service, I would definitely not recommend this clinic.",2024-11-28T08:02:41.673Z,Retail

Luminous Dental (Yishun) - Invisalign & Dental Implants in Singapore,5,"Has been seeing Dr Ryan for at least 4 years in NorthPoint! He‚Äôs so patient and meticulous that I introduced my whole family and friends here to see him too! Recently brought my mother (aged 64) for her teeth extractions after much persuasion (you know old people and how adamant they are, she finally budged bcos my sister is getting married and she need to have nice teeth and smile for the photo shoot).

It‚Äôs her first teeth extractions in almost 3 decades so she was nervous and slightly scared. Dr Ryan patiently explained to us her conditions (in both English and mandarin, this man knows 4 languages!) and we schedule for a follow up appointment to do the extractions. (All in one go, as requested by the mother)

On extraction day, Dr Ryan was very reassuring and calm down the mother. The extractions went extremely well and, so well that we did the teeth extraction at 10am and my mum is at her favorite Yakun drinking kopi at 4pm.

Feedback from the mother is she really like Dr Ryan, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs very patient, helpful and detailed‚Äù, ‚Äúyou know how sometimes going to see doctor / dentist is like seeing lawyer (every minute counts), but he takes his time to do slowly‚Äù, ‚Äúif I know not so scary, I will have come earlier‚Äù

The nurses at luminous dental are also really good and they will call you a day after the extractions to follow up if you have any pain or problems so kudos to everyone who works there!

The only con that I will say is Dr Ryan is so popular that you need to book in advance for his weekend / evening slots. I have recommended to many friends and brought my family here and everyone end up adoring him!",2023-08-02T08:36:39.840Z,Food & Beverage

Actually  doctor‚Äôs behaviour plays a critical role in a patient‚Äôs overall experience and recovery. When a doctor shows bad behaviour, such as being rude, impatient, dismissive, or careless, it can have serious negative effects on a patient.
Yes,, we are migrants workers but we are human not animal, we value our life, we lloves our life,doctor's care/Services should be equal for every patients, the patients could be black or white and local or forgoer.

Bcz of dontor's  behaviour  Patients may lose trust in the doctor and avoid sharing important health information, which can affect diagnosis and treatment.
Negative interactions can make patients feel anxious, disrespected, or scared, which can worsen their mental and physical condition.

Doctor's   behaviour is more crucial than medicine.
The lady really  not deserve  to be  a doctor .

This message to the management..
Plz identify them those who doesn‚Äôt know how to behave  with a patients otherwise display a big signage and write on the signage that migrants workers are not allowed to get treatment from here.",2025-07-18T06:53:24.290Z,retail

My heartfelt thanks to Dr Paul Ang, Mdm Marni, Ms Joice and the entire team at Zenith Medical Clinic. Since 2019, they have provided my mum with warm, attentive, and reliable care.

ZENITH MEDICAL CLINIC,5,"Came in on a sunday evening for blocked ears that disturbed me for a few weeks. Grateful for the team that managed to get rid of all the excess earwax within minutes, my hearing feels so much better now. FYI, they performed both microsuction and ear syringing, which was painless and nothing to worry about! Doctor was especially professional and patient with us.

Note that sunday evening is a walk-in clinic, first come first serve, strongly recommend you come a few minutes before opening to ensure you get seen quickly. Came around 5.50pm, got seen within half an hour. Heard other patients that came around 6.20pm and have to wait 1-2hrs.

If you need a clinic to remove your earwax and restore hearing, this is the clinic to go to. Highly recommend. Charges are also reasonable, $40 for cleaning both ears (excluding consult fee which was $49 for sundays).",2025-06-15T14:59:26.317Z,food and beverages

He listened with empathy and was aware that I am allergic or sensitive to many pain medications. He gave the antibiotics that I am used to take when I have bacterial infections.

This is the first time that I realized a private clinic can refer to my past medical histories in hospitals (SKH etc). I thought that I needed to go to polyclinic for the doctors to have easier reference of my past medical histories.

Actually, I prefer a female doctor as I feel very anxious when male doctors touch me, especially on the painful areas. Also, it's better for female Muslims like me to be examined by female doctors. However, Dr Jonathan Tan was gentle.

I had to see the doctor as I was really in pain and that was the nearest clinic nearby my house which was still open.

Dad went to see Kenneth Tan. My dad told Kenneth Tan that his throat feels like something stuck in it and has a little bit of phlegm WITHOUT any pain and that this has been ongoing for a few days.

After my dad comes home, he said he was unsure why antibiotic was prescribed to him and so I called the clinic and spoke to Kenneth Tan to help him find out.

The moment I introduced myself, he proceeded to say my dad had a ‚Äúsore throat‚Äù. This puzzled me as my dad clearly told him he doesn‚Äôt feel ANY PAIN.

We have no right to ask about the medication given is it? All I wanted to understand was why antibiotic was given. Additionally, Kenneth Tan confirmed he is UNSURE if my dad has any throat infection unless some test is done. So I continued to ask my original question  - why was antibiotic given then?

They might not have the medicine we needed which were suppositories but they have the standard oral cold and cough medicine, but doctor and the counter staff all took the time and effort in trying to ensure my daughter was alright.

That evening, my 1yo son suddenly developed a high fever of almost 40 degrees. I rushed back from work to bring him to this clinic, and he even vomited once on the way there. We reached there around 7pm which was near their closing time. It wasn't our first time visiting this clinic at such timing but this time, we were turned down as they were already having many patients in queue. As I was really worried for my son's condition, I desperately explained our situation and begged them to take us in, assuring that we will be fast. The nurse empathised with us and helped to check with Dr Ong. However, she turned us down on both tries, without even looking at my son's face or checking his temperature.
I understand that we were late and that she would definitely have to work overtime if she had agreed to see us. However, I just can't help but feel disappointed at her response. Anyway thanks to her, we found another doctor who was willing to see my son immediately after knowing about his high temperature. Thankfully it wasn't serious and he recovered a few days later.

As a healthcare professional myself, I am familiar with the standard protocols for patient assessment, and I observed that several essential steps were not followed during our visit.

No vital signs were taken, no questions were asked regarding family medical history, and I was interrupted when attempting to share some information. Furthermore, medication was prescribed immediately, seemingly based on incomplete and random results, without a comprehensive evaluation.

I found this approach unprofessional and concerning, as it did not demonstrate the thoroughness and patient-centered care that should be expected in a clinical setting.

Sunbeam Medical Clinic,1,"While I appreciate the professionalism of the doctor, I am extremely disappointed by the way the clinic has rejected patients twice in a row within two consecutive days.

On the first day, I arrived at 11:00 AM, one full hour before the clinic‚Äôs stated closing time of 12:00 PM, only to be turned away despite being very unwell. The following day, I came back at 11:45 AM, when the clinic was supposed to be open until 1:00 PM, and once again, I was rejected.

As a neighborhood clinic, it should be expected that patient volume may increase, especially given the rise in COVID cases. COVID aside, if the clinic refuses to see patients until the posted closing time, then it is misleading and unacceptable. If the policy is to stop accepting patients well before closing, that should be clearly communicated‚Äîeither on the website or through a prominent notice that registration closes at least an hour before closing time.

Being turned away twice after arriving well before closing is completely unacceptable, especially for those seeking urgent care. The nurses, who seemed eager to close the doors early, only added to the frustration. This is not how a healthcare facility should operate, especially in a community where it may be the only option for many.

After reading other reviews, it‚Äôs clear that this clinic has a reputation for rejecting seriously ill patients. I strongly urge you to reconsider your operational practices and address this issue immediately. Patients deserve better care and transparency.

Both me and mom had a good experience here, kind & friendly receptionist lady who did my registration for a basic eye checkup. Dr Lim did an excellent job asking background and what I wanted to check before proceeding with an eye check to test pressure, dryness, reading of alphabets and provided some advice for eye care. Also advised on further test, very transparent about cost and advised on further test based on what I mentioned initially.
He was calm, kind, precise & clear when giving instructions during the eye examination and apologised a few times as the bright light (looks like Sauron from lord of the rings) was shone into each eye.
Thank you for the kindness shown during the checks because it makes a huge difference so that anyone who hates going for checkups all to the clinic knows that it‚Äôs not so scary especially if you are someone who is extra sensitive with eyesight or senses.

No matter what problem we bring to him‚Äîbig, small, or downright confusing‚Äîhe handles it with care, patience, and professionalism. It‚Äôs so hard to find a doctor like that these days. His standard of care is unparalleled. From day one, he has consistently demonstrated a level of compassion and thoroughness that is hard to find. He listens attentively, takes the time to answer all of my questions, and always ensures I feel heard and understood. It is clear that he is also committed to our long term health and wellbeing.

Even after we moved to a different house, we still travel all the way back to his clinic because no other doctor will ever come close. Now we‚Äôre stuck with him for life because nobody else will ever match his level of dedication and kindness. In an age where healthcare can sometimes feel impersonal, Dr Lim sets the gold standard for what patient care should be. If more doctors followed his example, the healthcare system would be a much better place for all of us. Highly recommend this clinic!",2024-12-06T04:56:12.280Z,retail

Tan & Nah Family Clinic,5,Dr shawn is one of the most patient doctors i have ever visited and he takes his time to conduct a full diagnosis instead of rushing to see more patients. His attitude and personality is amazing too!,2025-07-29T04:10:53.969Z,Arts
Tan & Nah Family Clinic,1,"My family, friends, and I have always trusted this clinic because of Dr Shawn‚Äôs consistently respectful and professional care. However, my recent experience with a locum (relief) doctor on Monday, 14 July 2025, as the final patient of the evening, was deeply disappointing and unprofessional.

As a 20-year-old female attending alone, I expected empathy and professionalism. Instead, I was met with a flippant, dismissive attitude. The doctor grinned, laughed, chuckled, and giggled throughout the consultation, as if my concerns were entertaining. I felt mocked and treated like a clown, not a patient. I doubt he would‚Äôve acted this way if I had been accompanied by my parents.

I presented with throat irritation, phlegm, ticklish and runny nose, and fever (prior to paracetamol taken over the last 2 days), and more. I was repeatedly told it was ‚Äújust a cold.‚Äù Whether or not medically true, the tone was belittling. I made it clear I‚Äôd been taking paracetamol for 2 days, yet he brushed off the fever history with ‚Äúno fever now means no influenza,‚Äù ignoring that paracetamol masks symptoms. He even claimed ‚Äúparacetamol isn‚Äôt to reduce fever‚Äù, and insisted it‚Äôs just to ‚Äúmake you feel better.‚Äù I was stunned to hear such misinformation from a licensed doctor.

I tried to share recent overseas travel to Thailand, but he showed no interest. No follow-up questions. When I asked what was being prescribed, he didn‚Äôt explain, just vaguely pointed to the counter and told me to ask the staff. This lack of clarity made me uncomfortable.

The throat check (shining light) lasted under 1 second. I have photos showing irritation and redness. When I raised concerns about my tonsils, he dismissed it saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen thousands of tonsils, I know ok‚Äù He didn‚Äôt ask about my phlegm. I had to literally state that it was yellow and white, which was met with amusement again. (As of 15 July, brown phlegm is also observed, photo available)

Even more disturbing was how he mocked the fact that I had written my symptoms in my Notes app, something I do at every doctor‚Äôs visit to stay organised. He saw it and repeatedly made degrading remarks like, ‚ÄúYou wrote so much, so you should know,‚Äù and ‚ÄúIf you research so much, you should know a virus doesn‚Äôt just go away.‚Äù I clarified it was a personal log, yet he kept chuckling. It was condescending and appalling.

The consultation felt rushed and disrespectful. Yes, I was the last patient, but that doesn‚Äôt excuse the impatience, interruptions or mocking tone. He seemed eager to end the session quickly, offering no reassurance, explanation, or guidance.

After brushing everything off as ‚Äújust a cold,‚Äù he used multiple pumps of hand sanitiser for himself but said nothing about what I should do. No mention of wearing a mask, isolating, distancing, or how long to take precautions. I live around vulnerable elderly. Basic advice should have been a given. His concern for his own hygiene stood in stark contrast to the lack of care shown toward a symptomatic patient.

This was, without exaggeration, the worst doctor experience I‚Äôve had in any clinic, polyclinic, or hospital, local or overseas. It was worlds apart from the professionalism Dr Shawn consistently upholds. I left feeling humiliated, unheard, and uncertain about the quality of care I received.

Out of legal consideration, I will not name the doctor here, but I will share his name directly with Dr Shawn if requested.

I am not surprised to see that other patients such as, lin thant kant and vexel have both left bad Google reviews 2 weeks ago and 1 year ago respectively describing a poor experience with this locum doctor.

I will be making a formal complaint to the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) regarding the locum doctor‚Äôs poor conduct.

I will also be sharing my experience with all my friends and family so they are made aware of the standard of care.

This review is written honestly, in good faith, based on my experience. It is not to defame, but to raise awareness and protect future patients. Respect, communication, and professionalism should never be optional.",2025-07-15T11:47:30.484Z,Arts

Minmed Clinic (Punggol),1,"I visited this clinic early this year to see the doctor regarding a yeast infection. I explained clearly to the doctor that I did not have itchiness or burning, only sensation, as if something was there. The consultation itself was fine, but what happened afterwards left me very uncomfortable.

While I was waiting for my medication outside, I could hear the reception staff talking and laughing among themselves. There were three of them,  two girls and one guy and they were giggling in a way that made me feel mocked. I distinctly heard the guy say ‚Äúhelp me can I ps leh,‚Äù which felt directed me. Immediately after, one of the girls laughed and said ‚Äúno, you do it,‚Äù and the guy then proceeded to call out my name and explained the medicine loudly, saying: ‚ÄúIf you feel ITCH down there you can apply the cream.‚Äù

This was extremely rude and unprofessional. First, I had already told the doctor that I did not have any itchiness, so his comment felt dismissive. More importantly, this is a private and sensitive medical issue, and it should have been handled discreetly. Instead, I felt like a clown being laughed at in front of others.

Medical visits should make patients feel safe, respected, and taken seriously. I hope the clinic can train staff to be more professional and discreet, especially when handling sensitive health matters.",2025-08-27T08:31:49.568Z,education

The assistant told me that they cannot do the HPV test the same day as HPV test  need a female doctor, i told the clinic my wife wouldn't mind the male doctor as to check everything at one go, but they say the male doctor can't do, so, just do the cardiovascular test, which is drawing some blood samples, and passed us 2 packet of FIT test kit, to bring home to prepare and bring back the FIT TEST KIT, on 2 separate days after collect the faeces sample. So we book the next day appointment to come down for the HPV test with a female doctor.
2) The next day,  we came down to the clinic, and the blood test report came out and we can at the same time reviewed by the doctor. The female doctor told us that after seeing the blood test result, my wife need to take the cholesterol medication, which we already inform the doctor that previously my wife had already taken the medicine before, but the doctor told us its necessary to take another blood test to check the liver before to confirm taking the cholesterol medicine. And it will cost $30 for the check. As we think that maybe it's necessary, we agree with the female doctor and do the blood test! the blood test was taken at the back of the.hand, and after taking the blood sample, pulling out the needle, the doctor told us that maybe the blood samples taken out was not enough, may need to take somemore, which mean to poke 1 more time. I advise the doctor to just submit the taken blood samples for test first to see if it's enough or not, then the doctor agreed. ""I dont think this procedure is professional as my wife was a bit traumatised by the doctor saying of may be poking again to collect blood""

My child was clearly unwell, but instead of interacting with him and thoroughly assessing the situation, I felt like I had to guide the entire process. It was as though I was doing his job for him, which is unacceptable.

The consultation felt rushed and impersonal, as if every patient is treated the same regardless of their unique needs. To make matters worse, the clinic didn‚Äôt have the necessary medications in stock, so I had to go to a pharmacy afterward, making the whole visit feel like a waste of time and money.

We went there because it's the only clinic that still open (3pm+), wherelse the rest open at 6pm/7pm. The reason i went there is to get my dad medical check to see if he is still able to continue his license or not. Instead of saying nicely, this doctor boastfully said.....
Why didn't you go to your own GP to get this test done? With the look on your dad, I can just fail this report, you know.

Both the women at reception never told me what is my Q number yet letting all patients before and after me in to the doctor room. I was still patiently waiting for my name to be called till only me and the other uncle (after me) left in the clinic around 4.20pm. This time I thought next is my turn. But then I thought wrong as they asked another new comer aunty in. Because of that I see then straight in their eyes yet they don't care. All for one and half hour I have been sitting in front of them and there is no way that they are not aware of me waiting for my turn. I got prolong and heavy menstrual flow and even the thick wing pad can't help my heavy bleeding. At this point I have no patient since I have an urgency already as my heavy bleeding due to fabroids killing me. Thus I asked them when is my turn and telling I already waited for over an hour. Then both of them see me like a ghost and telling me those they let in have appointments and they can't tell my turn. It's really rubbish and terrible. I asked again when is my turn and telling them it's emergency for me and I already waited for so long and if they have many people before me they should tell me before or after I registered into their journal. After repeating 3/4 times for same question they told me I'll be the next one. I am still waiting patiently till now and it's nearly 30 minutes again and now past 4.30pm.

Really terrible and painful experience with unprofessional clinic assistants at this clinic. They are not helpful for emergency people like me. I just need some pills to delay my menses before getting gynae appointment.

Prohealth 24-Hour Medical Clinic,1,"I had a disappointing experience with a doctor regarding my 3-year-old daughter. She had visible mouth ulcers, and I suspected hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). Since it‚Äôs difficult to get her to open her mouth during consultations, I took a photo beforehand to show the doctor for better clarity.

However, when I tried to show him the picture, he refused to look at it, saying, ‚ÄúThe patient is here, I can see for myself.‚Äù I asked if she had HFMD, and he immediately dismissed it, saying, ‚ÄúParents like to scare themselves with HFMD.‚Äù When I asked if it was an ulcer on her tongue, he said no, but when I pressed further and asked for a diagnosis, he only replied, ‚ÄúMust be something else,‚Äù without giving any clear explanation. Despite this vague assessment, he still prescribed medication and issued a bill for $77.

The next day, my daughter‚Äôs condition worsened, and she refused to eat for two days straight. I brought her to another doctor and it turns out I was right. She did have HFMD and mouth ulcers. The second doctor confirmed the diagnosis and even told me to disregard the medication prescribed by the first doctor because it wasn‚Äôt appropriate. He also explained that HFMD can sometimes only present in the mouth, without showing on hands or feet.

I don‚Äôt mind waiting, and I don‚Äôt mind paying for proper medical care. But the least that should be done is to listen to our concerns and make a proper effort to diagnose a child. This is not just any patient, it‚Äôs a small child who can‚Äôt express their symptoms clearly.

Headed down with the elderly family member and had the jab at estimated 1820 hrs, the locum doctor gave the jab. Afterwards when we were due for payment, the staff member - a malay lady told us that the final bill is $40. We were confused and asked why the price was so high and not what was previously quoted with a pioneer card.

The lady then told us the time slot we have was under a locum doctor. Hence, the $9 offer could not be valid. In addition, she mentioned that she was not around to prevent the locum doctor from giving the jab as the offer would not be valid. The junior staff - a chinese lady was unsure about the protocols as to how the $9 offer goes about.

If so, why did the caller tell me that I could come ANYTIME.

Edit: Updated as of 17/02/25. My family member received a phone call from a staff by the name of Xris, who was helpful in refunding us the excess of $31 from the initial billing of $40.

Was warded in class 2B, 6 beds room with air-conditioning. Nurses were very attentive, caring, patient and helpful. Many serve with a cheerfulness that brightens up the stay. Many even make the effort to call patients by name, making effort to learn key phases in different dialects and languages to communicate with multi racial non English speaking patients. Nurses will take note of the amount of meals consumed and feedback to the dietician who will come to talk to the patient who is not eating and try to adjust the meals to suit them. There are too many nurses to remember their names and it is not fair to just name a few.
Thank you to all the nurses üôèüôèüôè in  Ward 3 West from bed 3316.

Another review had mentioned that personal belongings were recorded like ""in a prison"". It is a necessary process. Many patients are elderly and forgetful. They may not remember what they brought with them. One night I was woken up by the next patient looking for his phone & calling out to the nurses. Four, 4! nurses came to look on his person, bed and cabinet for it. I told them his daughter had brought it home to charge as they didn't bring the charger. That particular review didn't do any justice to the dedication of the staff.

Ang Mo Kio-Thye Hua Kwan Hospital,1,"My mum was injured by a nurse when she was in AMK hospital. A nurse literally ran her into a wall in the toilet. She let out a scream and the nurse said sorry. My mum did not think much of the incident as there was no immediate pain. A couple of days later, my mum's ankle was swollen and a doctor called me. I request for an update call but no one call me. I visit my mum later in the evening and request for a report. The staff nurse promised me a report in the next day which was a Friday as she was off on the same day. She claimed they will do a thorough investigation but no one interview my mum on the incident. Even the X-ray and dressing of the wound was done 8 hours after the report by the doctor.

On Friday, when I requested for the report, the Nursing Assistant Director said that some staff are not back from off and vacation.
I request a written report from the Service Quality Exec and he agreed. On the next Mon, I was inform that the report will be delayed to Wed afternoon. On Wed, I met with the Nursing Director Joanne, Operations Director Nicholas and Doctor Derrick. They claimed that they completed their investigations and none of their nurses remember any incidents regarding my mum. Also no written report will be provided to me. As her X-ray was ok, Nicholas said that the hospital was not responsible for her injury as no staff provided any injury report. For the fact, my mum can hardly stand and is a ""fall risk"" patient, must less kick out and injure herself. My mum also mentioned that when she was bathing herself most of the days, the nurses were playing their handphones rather than paying attention to her.

The lack of integrity and responsibility of the senior management is shocking. The repeated inabilities to meet their promises and their claim of non-responsibility speak for itself.

But I must commend the therapists Cherie and Brina for helping my mum with her therapy sessions. Their cheerful and friendly attitude and attention to details were the highlights of my mum's stay. Kudos to the 2 of them.

Enough said, one can check the staff reviews on Glassdoor for the problems and issues with the hospital.",2024-05-20T10:16:46.619Z,Arts

Sprained my ankle, in pain and when the clinic finally opened at 1430pm, i was told to come back half an hour later. The other patients were told the same.

Half an hour later, we came back and told the receptionists that it‚Äôs 1500pm already. To my horror, the doctor did not even reached yet; what‚Äôs worse, the receptionists told us that if the doctor have not reached the clinic, patients weren‚Äôt allowed to wait inside the clinic. The receptionists said it‚Äôs their rule, in Mandarin.

One of the male patients flared up, and rebutted how could the clinic tell patients to come back and the patients were not able to receive treatment in time? The receptionists were not able to give a proper answer and satisfactory reply.

How is it okay if clinic opens at around 1430 but the doctors have not even reached their office? How is it okay if the sick and old are waiting outside the clinic to see the doctor? Is this professionalism? Is that what they are taught in Medicine School?

We went in to see doctor at 4.50 and came out from the doctor‚Äôs room at 5.10 because she was so patient with all my questions as a novice in Covid. And you guess what? they should be closed by 5pm.

After seeing so many 1-star review, I would like to justify for the clinic with my own observations. This is my first time visiting this clinic, after being turned away by another overwhelmed clinic.
The front desk emphasized to me the estimated waiting time on the phone and requested me to register personally first. This sounds fair to me so I went.
So after the registration, the lady helped to estimate what time will be your turn, then ask you to come back nearer to the estimated timing. They even make the effort to call me when my turn is coming.
Therefore, the clinic looked empty as they did not let the patients wait in the clinic even though there is a long queue. This is especially good for the pioneer generation who stays nearby. Can minimize the risk by waiting at a clinic full of patients with various conditions.

Yio Chu Kang MRT Clinic,1,"This was my first and definitely last visit to this clinic. As echoed by most other reviews, I found Dr. Terence Koh to be unprofessional, dismissive, rude and lacking basic empathy.

I visited the clinic on 7 August shortly after moving to Yio Chu Kang and had one of the worst clinic experiences I‚Äôve ever encountered. Upon entering the consultation room, the doctor asked about my condition. As I began explaining, he abruptly stopped me and asked for the queue number chip, which my husband was holding outside. When I mentioned that, he asked me why was it outside and requested that I leave the room to retrieve it ‚Äî over a queue chip that could‚Äôve easily been returned to the receptionist afterwards.

As I described my symptoms, including vomiting the night before and again that morning, he maintained a constant frown and asked when I had last experienced these issues. I shared that I had consulted a specialist in 2023 for suspected vertigo, though no resolution was found and this seems like a recurring problem. His response? A dismissive ‚ÄúYou feel dizzy every day ah?‚Äù ‚Äî a question that felt belittling rather than medically constructive.

The examination was equally questionable. He palpated my stomach and casually concluded, ‚ÄúNo wind, can‚Äôt be‚Äù then asked me to follow his finger with my eyes. Afterwards, he remarked, ‚Äúdo you feel dizzy, no right?‚Äù ‚Äî as if that alone could rule out my symptoms. Since when following a finger will make you dizzy?

There were no other patients at the clinic during my visit which, in hindsight, may say something. It‚Äôs hard to believe the few positive reviews here aren‚Äôt written by friends or family.

MY FAMILY CLINIC (CHOA CHU KANG),5,"I‚Äôve been visiting My Family Clinic, CCK  with my family for over 20 years & Dr. Yun has been an incredible GP throughout. He‚Äôs patient, listens carefully & always takes the time to make accurate diagnoses. What truly sets him apart is his dedication to follow-up care‚Äîhe genuinely ensures we‚Äôre okay & on the right path to recovery.

The only downside is the long waiting time, but it‚Äôs understandable because Dr. Yun spends a lot of time with each patient to provide thorough check-ups & the best possible treatment. While waiting can be frustrating, it‚Äôs a small price to pay for such high-quality care.

Dr. Yun is a doctor who truly cares & he‚Äôs been a tremendous help during health crises for my family.

However, upon arriving punctually at 8.30am today, we were informed that individuals who came earlier‚Äîdespite having later appointments scheduled at 9.30am etc‚Äîwere prioritized, as the clinic operates on a first-come, first-served basis.

According to the administrative staff, our waiting time may exceed one hour. She is unsure of the exact timing.

This raises the question of why the clinic accepts appointment bookings if they ultimately follow a first-come, first-served approach.

MY FAMILY CLINIC (CHOA CHU KANG),1,"I am extremely disappointed with the service at this clinic. We waited over 3 hours just to see the doctor, and when we finally did, my daughter was diagnosed with an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Despite that, the doctor prescribed her steroids, which raised concerns.

I called the clinic for an explanation, and I was told that the syrup was meant to open her airway and prevent asthma, and the inhaler was for asthma use over a few days. If that's the case, shouldn't the diagnosis have been asthma instead of a simple URTI? It feels like my daughter was misdiagnosed.

She‚Äôs a child, and it's incredibly worrying to have to guess when to stop using steroid medication without proper guidance. This level of carelessness is unacceptable. I will be reporting this to the Ministry of Health (MOH) and demanding further explanation.

Admiralty Medical Centre (AdMC) Clinical Services,5,"I don't usually write reviews because who even reads them... right? ( I am a lazy person in general but this is the one time i actually feel like i just had to )

I had an appointment at the sports & medicine clinic for this knee pain that has been bugging me for quite some time now but was somewhat tolerable (about time i get it checked up), and whilst waiting for my queue number to get called, i was quite nerve-wrecked to be very honest as i did not really know what to expect - bad news or worse, a Doctor who could care less about me (i am just a socially awkward person).

But all that worry immediately vanished after i met a godsend otherwise known as Dr Teoh Chin Sim. Right from the get go, i knew i was in good hands, from the charismatic way she assessed my condition and potrayed herself, i was able to fully express the discomfort in my knee i was facing, and could feel that Dr Teoh was on the same page as i was. It was like explaining my knee pain to a friend who cared (Even sharing some similarities as I before have undergone surgery by person A from KTPH whom is actually the HOD of Dr Teo. It genuinely amused me to see how everything felt interconnected.)

At last, i learnt that i actually had a common injury called a Jumper's Knee, which was proven by an ultrasound that Dr Teoh had expertly done on my knee, showcasing to me along the way the differences between a healthy and unhealthy tendon, etc and the different treatment plans for it. Additionally i learnt that Admiralty Medical Centre is actually under KTPH.

Overall, i am really glad with how things went, I thought it was just gonna be another one of those consultation which does not tell me anything and feel like a waste of money.

The clinic itself is a rather typical neighbourhood clinic. No electronic queue system, so don't expect to walk away and wait for SMS notification. It can get quite crowded on Monday mornings, so come early or late to avoid the peak crowd.

The family clinic resides in the same unit as Thomson Women's Clinic.

They have different doctors on rotation, some of them being permanent doctors while others are temporary. If you have a specific doctor in mind to ask for, call them up before coming down.

Dear SIR

With all due respect, I would like to clarify a few matters. I was asked to remove my review, and I also noticed some inconsistencies that I hope you can address.

You mentioned that my company is not connected to your clinic. However, our company‚Äôs medical sheet continues to show Harmony Family Clinic as the designated clinic. Could you kindly explain why your clinic‚Äôs name still appears in our records despite this?

Even your clinic was recommended to me by one of my colleagues, who previously completed his medical examination there for his renewal..

I would appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Harmony Family Clinic,1,"I visited Dr. Sin today due to an itchy infection. When my name was called, I assumed it was my turn because I didn‚Äôt see any other female patients around at the time. However, it turned out that there was another patient with a very similar name to mine. Unfortunately, Dr. Sin did not confirm my full name when I entered the consultation room, and it wasn‚Äôt until after the check-up that the mix-up was noticed.

This situation could have been avoided with a more accurate system for calling patients. I would recommend suggest implementing a number-calling system displayed on a screen or wall to reduce confusion, especially when patients have similar names. Additionally, I noticed that Dr. Sin's voice was quite loud even though I was standing nearby went she came out to say that i m not the patient she called! This came across as abrupt and could be toned down in future.

Lastly, I would like to commend the clinic staff. Despite my unpleasant experience with the consultation, one of the staff members kindly explained the situation and even apologized on Dr. Sin‚Äôs behalf, which I truly appreciated.

Beds were near to each other (similar to nursing homes) and there were 40 beds in that observation ward (EDTU). About half the beds were occupied, so loads of space and free area.

The fact that the numbers run out just 30 mins into opening is probably because of Dr Chui being patience for his clients but at the same time, he always reach the clinic more than 30mins after the supposed clinic operating hour. This time round I went to see Dr Chui for my usual medication,  and  there is a need to do blood test. I just pondered for a moment whether to do it, he replied ""you can go look for other doctor"".

Q & M Dental Surgery (Buangkok MRT),5,"An Exceptional First Visit ‚Äì Truly Grateful

It was my first visit to this clinic, and the experience opened up a whole new world for me. I‚Äôve been to many dental clinics over the years, but this is the first and only one where I felt completely safe and comforted in their hands.

Around 6pm, I was suddenly hit with a terrible dull toothache. I reached out to my usual nearby clinics, but none could take me and all pushed me to the next working day. The pain was unbearable, and I knew I couldn‚Äôt wait.

My husband kept trying other clinics, and this was the only one that agreed to see me‚Äîeven though they were fully booked. They asked me to come in at 8:30pm, just 30 minutes before closing time, and I rushed down in 20 minutes.

When I arrived, the counter staff warmly received me and kindly explained that I might need to wait. I truly didn‚Äôt mind‚ÄîI was just so thankful they accepted me last minute.

During the wait, I saw how committed and busy the team was. Even late into the night, they were attending to patients with care and professionalism.

It was clear - Patients are their top priority.

When it was finally my turn, the dentist apologised for the wait and still gave me her full attention and care‚Äîeven though it was way past her working hours. That left a deep impression on me.

The service here is top-notch, and the compassion and dedication of the team are beyond words. Thank you for going above and beyond for your patients. I‚Äôm so glad I found this clinic.

I sought a second opinion from another clinic this year, and the dentist confirmed that my teeth can indeed be pushed back properly. I‚Äôm disappointed with the lack of transparency and the results.

Family Dental Centre Victoria Rivervale,1,"Terrible experience at Rivervale mall FDC family dental center!

Brought my young son here for his first dental visit and it was a terrible experience. The clinic had called me earlier today to move my appointment earlier, and I agreed. During the consultation, when the dentist asked my son if he wanted to extract his tooth or not ‚Äî in a blunt, impatient tone ‚Äî saying you want to do or not! he then added that we were already ‚Äúlate,‚Äù despite the clinic being the one who had moved the appointment and we were on time.

From the start, his manner was unfriendly and dismissive. He used a snide, sarcastic tone, completely inappropriate statements and improper annotations to say to a parent in front of a child. Instead of explaining the procedure, offering reassurance, or coaxing a child (as any competent children‚Äôs dentist should), he made him feel pressured and frightened. I was so appalled I decided to walk out halfway through the consultation.

Such behaviour is unethical, unprofessional, and unacceptable, especially for someone working with children. While you continue practising dentistry, may I suggest you also practise your manners as a professional. Such lousy service should never be tolerated. Parents and children deserve kindness, respect, and proper care, not rudeness and indifference. I hope no parents nor any patients patronising will ever have to experience this!
Such Horrendous act should not be tolerated.",2025-08-15T09:47:06.750Z,Retail

Joy Dental Centre (Buangkok),1,"I visited Dr. Rachel and was quoted $500 per session. If I were to split it into two sessions, it would be $275 each time I visited, totaling $550.
For this amount, she said it will be out of goodwill charging it cheaper for one session. They said I could reconsider and book my appointment if I am  interested, so I ended up having to pay $43+ for the consultation fee.

After calling two different dental clinics, I found out they are only charging $150 to $200 at the most for scaling and polishing with numbing cream. Would suggest people to check for prices elsewhere it will most likely be more affordable.

Another bad experience I had was when Dr. Rachel used a metal instrument to poke my gums multiple times. Despite telling her it was painful, she continued poking around my upper gums causing it to bleed.",2025-04-16T07:32:38.297Z,Retail

When I went there yesterday (12 July 2025), I was told that the charges for sedation by an external anesthesiologist is $1000 and proceeded to book an appointment for consultation. When I went for the consultation and x-ray today, I was told by the Sunday shift receptionist that the charges for the sedation is $1500. She then pointed to the pricing on the board under tooth extraction with sedation that it is from $19xx onwards and that the price is for sedation only. I questioned why would she charge me $1500 if as she said sedation is $1900 upwards. She quickly just charged me the cost for today‚Äôs visit and said nothing else.

Family Dental Centre Victoria Hougang,1,"My husband had a very disappointing experience at this dental clinic in Jan 2025. He went in for a routine general cleaning, but without any prior explanation or consent, they proceeded with a deep cleaning instead which was barely only for less than 15minutes. He was completely unaware of this and was hit with a hefty $300+ bill at the end!

To make things worse, they did not provide a receipt or a cost breakdown, claiming that they are ""not supposed to"" issue any for insurance claims. This is highly questionable, as other dental clinics have no issue providing such documentation.

The lack of transparency and poor communication is unacceptable. Patients deserved to be informed about the procedures being done and the costs involved beforehand.

Northeast Medical Group (Sengkang Clinic),1,"I had a deeply unpleasant experience with Dr. Wong Chin Shing Sam, and felt compelled to share it in hopes of informing others. It was truly a culture shock for me this was the first time I‚Äôve encountered a medical professional so rude and dismissive. It was genuinely a huge culture shock for me.

I brought my elderly grandmother in for a consultation, hoping for basic respect and attentiveness, but unfortunately, we were met with the opposite. As another reviewer rightly pointed out, his tone was harsh and completely lacking in warmth or empathy. He seemed disinterested throughout, brushing off our questions and speaking to my granny in a way that was unnecessarily curt and disrespectful.

It was clear to both of us that he had no intention of engaging with care or patience. My grandmother left the clinic feeling dismissed and demoralized, and we both wholeheartedly agreed that the way he treated her was unkind and unprofessional.

I understand that not every patient-doctor interaction will be warm and fuzzy, but basic decency and respect should never be compromised especially when dealing with elderly patients. This experience has left a lasting negative impression, and I would not recommend him based on our visit.",2025-07-30T10:01:05.344Z,education

The doctor dismissed me in less than 5 minutes and i have ask isit HFMD or what n he just said I just had common folliculitis and prescribed steroids. I went home and applied it once, and I felt very uncomfortable. And the red spots kept increasing. What was even more strange was that I said I didn't have a cough or nasal congestion, but he prescribed me a cough and nasal congestion solution. He didn't give me any antipruritic medicine, antipyretic medicine, antibiotics, etc. After two days, it became more and more serious. I went to another clinic and was diagnosed with chickenpox! I also showed the second doctor the prescription given by my first doctor. The second doctor said that steroids cannot be applied to chickenpox because it will reduce our immunity and the chickenpox will increase. This is why my fever keeps coming back. In short, this is a very unprofessional and careless clinic. I advise everyone not to go here if you have serious cases.

Northeast Medical Group (Sengkang Clinic),1,"Dr Sam Wong‚Ä¶

Came in with sore throat and an infected eye. Had similar symptoms 2-3 weeks back and was prescribed certain medications which I had informed him of. Dr Sam Wong insisted it was not bacterial infection, but a viral one. But I clarified I have no cough, flu, blocked nose (after his attempt to suggest it‚Äôs viral), and then he proceeded to suggest it‚Äôs acid reflux? And asked if I eat spicy food, sour food, etc - to which I replied NO for all the above. He then asked if I wear contacts and I said no.

After having multiple ‚Äúno‚Äùs to probes that align with his insistence that it‚Äôs viral infection, he then said he can provide antibiotics but he doesn‚Äôt think it will work. Just to clarify - I did not ask for antibiotics to be prescribed I just noted that I took it previously when I had the same symptoms 2/3 wks ago. Here, I would like to ask, what‚Äôs the point of his diagnosis when all questions are asked to feed his inherent assumptions and his reluctance to provide a medication which he thinks wouldn‚Äôt even work?!

He then also added on that my previous set of eye drops contain antibiotics and that my eye infection is because of allergy. Well I guess  I can suddenly develop allergies that I do not know of. But he proceeded to probe if it‚Äôs painful when I already said no, there‚Äôs no feeling it‚Äôs just red! And he wouldn‚Äôt explain why he thinks it‚Äôs allergy as well, just ‚Äúit‚Äôs allergy‚Äù x2

I believe that his certification to be a family doctor goes beyond being assuming.

Medication I got at check out:
- Antibiotics (reluctantly given out)
- Allergy eye drops

Well and I thought that I will be getting a sore throat medicine that aligns with his supposed diagnosis but no! I don‚Äôt expect every doctor to diagnose patients perfectly due to subjectivity and reactivity, but there was literally no diagnosis. He just gave me what I had 2/3 weeks ago, the thing he said wouldn‚Äôt work.

Northeast Medical Group (Sengkang Clinic),1,"I had a very disappointing experience during my recent visit to Northeast Clinic with Dr. Wong. I shared that I had been coughing for more than two weeks and was beginning to experience mild breathing difficulties. However, Dr. Wong quickly dismissed my concerns and insisted it was acid reflux, stating that ‚Äúa cough can‚Äôt last so long.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt seem interested in exploring other possibilities or asking further questions.

Instead, he immediately started advising me to avoid tea, coffee, spicy, and oily food. Then, without any basis, he asked, ‚ÄúYou smoke, right?‚Äù When I replied no, he completely ignored my answer and continued telling me to quit smoking. He then asked if I drank alcohol. Again, I said no, but he brushed past that and told me to stop drinking. He finished by saying, ‚ÄúMost importantly, you must lose weight ‚Äî once you‚Äôre slim, everything will be okay.‚Äù

I was appalled by this dismissive and presumptive approach. I left the clinic feeling unheard and disrespected. A doctor should listen, ask questions, and consider the patient‚Äôs input ‚Äî not make assumptions or offer one-size-fits-all advice without proper diagnosis. I hope the clinic takes this feedback seriously to ensure better care for future patients.",2025-05-26T07:30:04.347Z,Retail
Northeast Medical Group (Sengkang Clinic),1,"An extremely disappointing and distressing experience my partner and I had during a recent visit to your clinic, under the care of Dr. Wong Chin Shing Sam.

My partner was suffering from a high fever, severe body aches, and overall physical discomfort. However, the consultation we received fell drastically short of acceptable medical standards. The entire appointment lasted less than one minute, during which Dr. Wong displayed a concerning lack of thoroughness and empathy.

Despite us clearly and repeatedly explaining that my partner had been experiencing persistent back pain and body aches that were unresponsive to over-the-counter painkillers, Dr. Wong dismissed our concerns. He neither conducted a physical examination nor attempted to assess the affected areas. Instead, he insisted that it was nothing serious and continued to suggest the same painkillers, offering no alternative diagnosis or further investigation.

Additionally, for the fever, no proper treatment plan was discussed. My partner was advised merely to rest. He exhibited no respiratory symptoms (such as coughing or a sore throat), yet was prescribed medication that appeared unrelated to his condition, raising questions about the relevance and necessity of the prescriptions. More concerningly, no antibiotics were prescribed, nor were any referrals suggested.

The entire consultation felt rushed, impersonal, and dismissive. It did not meet even the most basic expectations of a medical check-up, let alone a professional evaluation tailored to the patient‚Äôs reported symptoms.

Reading the reviews, this is not the first time that there were complaints regarding Dr. Wong‚Äôs conduct and approach toward patients. It is deeply troubling that despite such recurring feedback, there appears to be little accountability or corrective action taken. A doctor‚Äôs attitude and attentiveness can significantly impact a patient‚Äôs health and well-being, and in this case, we left the clinic feeling frustrated, unheard, and concerned for the quality of care being provided to others.

I sincerely hope this complaint will be taken seriously. I urge the clinic to conduct a thorough review of this incident and consider implementing improved protocols to ensure that all patients receive respectful, attentive, and competent care.",2025-05-24T06:30:57.175Z,food and beverages

A consultation fee of $35,was definitely not worth it especially since our conversation was barely worth 2 minutes.
What's worse is that he had given me the wrong prescription of medication for my condition and I had only found out about it when I went to see a skin specialist.
If you're unsure of the issue, I would have respected you if you had just suggested that I should see a specialist from the start instead of wasting my time and causing my condition to worsen. It's serious to prescribe the wrong medication due to poor evaluation.",2025-01-24T12:42:41.148Z,Arts

Doctor who saw him told him that his wounds required deeper cleaning and has to be done under GA. Told him to stay fasted .

At 9pm he was told no surgery slot available has to wait till next day.

Woodlands Health Campus,1,"I had a very troubling experience at the A&E on 25 August (morning). What I witnessed from the medical staff was highly unprofessional and not what patients should be exposed to when seeking care.

1. Poor coordination ‚Äì Multiple doctors and nurses asked the same questions and repeated the same checks, showing confusion and lack of communication.

2. Overpowering scents ‚Äì Several staff were heavily doused in perfume/cologne to the point it was unbearable and even gave me a headache. This is inappropriate in a clinical environment.

3. Compromised hygiene ‚Äì Nurses were seen sitting on empty patient beds. This raised serious concerns about cleanliness and sterility.

4. Unprofessional behaviour ‚Äì A doctor and several nurses were being overly casual and playful with each other during duty hours. Their conduct did not reflect the professionalism expected in a hospital setting.

5. Noise and disruption ‚Äì Staff were laughing and talking loudly in the early morning hours, disturbing patients who were unwell and trying to rest.

The overall atmosphere felt less like a hospital ward and more like a social gathering, which was shocking and disappointing. Patients deserve professionalism, respect, and a healing environment, not this. I sincerely hope the hospital takes these issues seriously and implements urgent improvements.",2025-08-23T22:48:21.618Z,Food & Beverage

Prepared to wait given that this is a public hospital but had had
much better experience at NUH, which is a lot more crowded but the waiting time is acceptable (within an jour). This clinic at Woodland Health campus is not crowded(see attached photo), the doctor just took way too long between patients. Doctor is in orthopaedic department.

after hospitalised
In 24/7 they asked him to come back for checkups. He travel from JB to SG with wounds and broken shoulder. When he reach there they said they didn‚Äôt ask him to come back for checkups, so wasted 6-7hours and transportation fee.
28/7 they ask him to do checkup, but when he reach they stated that he need to go another hospital for checkups ‚Äúwhich didn‚Äôt inform advance‚Äù waste is time again!
28/7 they know about my father‚Äôs company will cover all the fee , but still ask him to contact company about a checkup fee $2k+ is it covered? But the thing is they should email to confirm with the company not the patient, which in case they didn‚Äôt even email company about $2k fee (after my father check with company) which is odd and troublesome. Just in case the company already cover $20k!
A wounded patient travels and wasted time due to didn‚Äôt even contact earlier or email the info about anything, all is vocally appointed, this had made us very annoying and troublesome.
I hope the hospital take this matter seriously, not all the patients have the will to travel so long hours for nothing, do you even consider he also need time to rest? And accidents/wound might get worse just to waste time on nothing?

I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) emergency responders who promptly came to assist my eldest daughter, during a medical emergency at Changi Airport Terminal 2 at around 6:30pm on 3 September 2025, and to the team of doctors, nurses, and medical staff at the Changi General Hospital (CGH) Emergency Department who subsequently took over her care.

My daughter had suffered a severe allergic reaction (Anaphylaxis) and the situation was extremely critical. Amid the chaos, we were unable to thank everyone individually or record your names. However, the professionalism, calmness, and kindness you displayed left a deep and lasting impression on our family.

The SCDF team arrived swiftly on scene, acted with clarity and coordination, and helped buy crucial time for further treatment.
The CGH emergency medical team then took over seamlessly, providing highly professional and attentive care that brought us a sense of trust and reassurance in a moment of great anxiety.

We are deeply grateful for the dedication and compassion you showed during such a critical moment, and we hold the highest respect for the work you do every day.

Through this message, we would like to extend our family‚Äôs sincere appreciation. We wish each of you continued good health and strength as you go on to support many more people with your skill and warmth.

And im not just talking about the ridiculous waiting time - ours concluded at 6 freaking damn hours and that's only after I've decided to demand for an update for my elderly father. Doctors were extremely subpar in their explanations. I called an ambulance for my father for a reason and we weren't provided with a specific answer in the end just because his symptoms have subsided from the ambulance and on the way to the hospital. A ridiculous 'doctor' even explained to me a 'reason' for it supposedly but funny what she pointed out at wasn't even a direct reply to my exact question. Yes they are there to save lives but with their attitudes and service, it seems like they're just wishing for every patient to disappear than having to address them.

Verdict: I am happy with the A&E services I received. From 11.30 pm on 7 Aug Thursday to 2.30am on 8 Aug , I observed people around me being well cared for. I noted how the team of doctors and staff were well-organised, attentive and even sensitive.

I felt well taken care of, from the pre-registration to the triage, to the general doctor, to the eye doctor. Yes, there was a wait for the general doctor, but the 30-40 min was not unreasonable, and the waiting room was clean and pleasant, the toilets were clean, the chairs were comfortable, the a/c wasn‚Äôt too cold (one could ask for blankets if needed)

So, really none of the stuff I primed myself for based on the many negative reviews.

The next morning, I experienced the eye clinic at the medical centre as the eye doctor asked me to report back for a check at 8.30am. After an hour wait, (the place was crowded with 60 other patients), I saw the same doctor (Leong)  I had seen the night before. She was being very careful with her assessment. I felt assured.

Dr Trin on duty was nice and promptly wrote a referral letter for me to make a trip down to a&e. Didn‚Äôt heed for his advice and ended up being admitted to the hospital the next day. Clinic assistant on duty was nice and helpful too, she kindly opened the back door to let me access to the carpark easier. Am always thankful to have met kind and compassionate medical staffs and especially to doctors who treat patients and cases seriously.

Only minus point is that their 24h clinic consultant price is abit high as compared to other private practices but they did inform over the phone before going down. Medication/jabs is on the normal range.

Will visit in future should I need any urgent care. Please keep up with the standard. Thank you team!",2025-08-14T08:15:33.216Z,Arts

I asked what the maximum number of days I could get rest for and he said 2 without acknowledging that I told him I literally cannot work without my voice. The previous time I visited was during covid for the same reason, and I received 5 days from another Dr. He shrugged it off and said come back if you still need MC.

Unihealth 24-Hr Clinic (Yishun),1,"I typically refrain from leaving negative reviews unless I find it absolutely necessary. While the doctors I‚Äôve encountered at this clinic have been adequate and professional, I believe there is significant room for improvement in the service provided by the front desk staff.

Patients who visit clinics are usually unwell and require timely medical attention. During my recent visit, I was turned away because the medical insurance portal was down. The reception staff simply advised me to ‚Äúcome back later,‚Äù without offering a specific timeframe or any form of follow-up. A more helpful approach could have been to offer a call-back once the system was restored.

On previous visits, when my insurance e-card failed to load, the receptionists did not attempt to verify my details or check the system manually. I was asked to pay in cash if I wished to proceed, despite being covered by insurance. In those situations, I paid out-of-pocket and filed a claim later due to the urgency of my condition.

What I‚Äôve consistently observed is a lack of empathy and initiative from the reception team.

Unihealth 24-Hr Clinic (Yishun),1,"This 1-star review is only for consultation by doctor.

I started visiting this clinic 2 years ago, and have given a 5-star rating. My first consultation was by Dr Gerald Fung, who was very professional and attentive. Since then I had nunerous revisits and seen other doctors on duty with no negative comments.

Today, I have decided to downgrade the rating to 1-star after being consulted by Dr Jonathon Hee whom I am seeing for the first time.

I explained to Dr Hee about my reason for consultation and explained my pre-exisiting medical condition (gout) as I believe my medical history should be captured in their system. Dr Hee told me that he feels that my leg pain is not due to gout when I requested for colchicine. He wanted to prescribe only arcoxia to relief the pain instead. I then told him that I had taken arcoxia for the past 2 days. When I asked him what was his professional opinion if he think this is not gout related, he asked me to come and take a blood test and x ray at the clinic or visit a polyclinic tomorrow.

He then mentioned that he did not want to ""argue"" with me about the diagnosis, and abruptly prescribed colchicine and ended the consultation.

Unihealth 24-hr Clinic should review Dr Jonathon Hee's poor attitude and lack of professionalism and compassion. It is sad to see such an unprofessional doctor serving at this clinic or any where else. I believe I am not the only one as I have also read other negative reviews on Dr Jonathon Hee.

Northland Family Clinic & Surgery,1,"I have been to this clinic multiple times, and I have to commend Dr. Lee Hwee Ming for being a helpful and patient doctor. However, I must address a concerning issue regarding the elderly receptionist at the front desk. During my previous visits, despite her somewhat unprofessional manner of speaking, I chose to overlook it to avoid causing any trouble. However, during my two most recent visits, I found that her attitude became increasingly bothersome.

The clinic's posted consultation hours are from 8:30 am to 12:30 pm and from 2:30 pm to 6:00 pm. Last week, when I called and was informed that they accepted the last patient at 5:30 pm, I ensured to arrive within that timeframe out of respect. Yet, upon my arrival, I was scolded for arriving ""late"". I explained my work commitments and confirmed the last acceptance time with them beforehand, but she kept on lecturing and told me ‚ÄúYou could‚Äôve just come earlier‚Äù, as it could affect their closing time and caused them to leave later. She added on saying that the doctor actually did not want to see me since I was ‚Äúlate‚Äù.

So, today, I made an effort to arrive earlier around 5:15 pm since leaving work earlier wasn't feasible. But guess what? Still got an earful for being 'late.' I was like, seriously? She went on about how we shouldn't wait until the last hour, and this led me to question why the consultation hours are showing 6:00 pm if arriving at 5:15 pm was deemed late. When I asked if the morning hours were until 12:30 pm, she shut that down too, saying I should've been even earlier than 12pm, and just apply leave and come in the morning. Throughout the conversation, her tone remained rude, demanding, and unprofessional, which was incredibly frustrating.

Honestly, the clinic should just revise their hours to 12 pm and 5 pm if that's what the receptionist wants. And they seriously need to address her attitude. I saw similar complaints in other Google reviews, and it's not a good look for the clinic, deterring regular patients like me from returning.",2024-03-27T13:30:02.838Z,Arts

Northshore Family Clinic,5,"Came here occasionally just for Dr Joel and Dr Wong. The clinic here is very busy due to its reputation, but the professionalism and standards are still well maintained!

The staff was friendly and understanding, from registration to collecting medications, there was no sign of impatience or attitude from the staff.

For the staff, they took the time to explain the dosage and what the medication is for. They even assisted to help process claims for company coverage. Not sure about the name but it was a young friendly lady wearing a hijab, maybe it‚Äôs cause the medication names are too complex in the field of medicine so I can‚Äôt understand anything but she still too the time to explain everything properly, which makes me feel comfortable and at ease üòÖ.

The doctors were friendly and make sure that they listen to the symptoms before providing a check and diagnosis.

Overall, she was humble and kind.

The miscommunication meant that I was assigned to enter Room 2, reserved for COVID-19 patients. The doctor asked me about my symptoms when I clarified I was there for a migraine and needed painkillers, not a swab test. Nevertheless, he was quick to serve me.

I wouldn't call him rude or insensitive, I've experienced worse. He was curt, asking questions, and then it was over in less than 3 minutes. I requested an MC for 1 day to rest and he gave it without question.

Docking 1 star because of a surprise addition to the prescribed medication. I think now I understand what other patients complained about. I think it's good to ask him exactly what he'll be prescribing you in case.

Lion Health Clinic & Surgery (Yishun),1,"Frankly, I am appalled by what I witnessed during my recent visit.

Your Manager, Kim the lady in the red dress today behaved in a manner that was completely unprofessional and outright disrespectful which needs to be checked if she‚Äôs fit for her role as she works as though the world has given her an unhappy life. She spoke to a staff member with an attitude that was not only dismissive, but shockingly rude! The staff member was asking a relevant question related to their work respectfully, mind you and Kim responded in a tone that was cold, condescending, and completely lacking in basic human decency. She cut them off mid-sentence in front of me while they were doing their job and assisting me.

This is not the first time I‚Äôve seen her speak this way to staff. This is now the third visit where I‚Äôve witnessed similar behavior from her. But today‚Äôs incident was by far the worst and absolutely, unacceptable.

Let me be clear: no employee deserves to be treated that way, especially not in front of patients. I can only imagine how much worse it gets behind closed doors when no one is watching. If this is the standard of leadership being upheld here, it‚Äôs absolutely disgraceful.

Something needs to be done. No patient should be watching a manager tear down their own team like that. And no staff should have to endure that kind of treatment
especially not from someone who‚Äôs supposed to be setting an example.

This needs to be addressed immediately.",2025-07-29T09:28:40.559Z,Arts

Singapore Thong Chai Medical Institution - Chin Swee Rd (Headquarters),3,"I attended an acupuncture session on Thursday night and was taken aback when the attending male physician mentioned out loud a few times in the treating room that the patient is having multiple medical condition. Medical care is private and confidential and professionalism must be observed at all times especially when the room was filled with so many other patients. Patients know their own medical conditions and it is definitely unwise to make public announcement of that to other patients to stigmatise them. Hope physicians restrict the use of patients‚Äô  medical record to treatment only. Please attend to this issue to ensure patients won‚Äôt feel threatened and shocked by this kind of practice.

Appreciate your timely reply, however, the first part of your response regarding holistic assessment and open consultation are not what my feedback was about. The open setting is also not an issue.

I sincerely hope you have spoken to the Thursday‚Äôs male physician to refrain from stigmatising patients who have a number of ailments by making open announcement to all unrelated patients. According to the physician schedule, there were only 2 male physicians on that Thursday.

The lovely ladies behind the counter would listen intently to what you are here for and if you are new would propose who should you see, when should you come etc. They also clear the registration pretty fast. Imagine i am 64 person behind it got cleared in 20mins, not bad for a charity organisation

Here is why i gave 3 stars.

You need to do your due diligence online reading reviews, who you should be seeing. The 1st guy i seen was extremely rude and obnoxious and not very attentive to what you say making you repeat multiple times  i was in a room with plenty of acupuncuture patients and while sharing experiences we all confirm that same guy being rude, obnoxious and unprofessional, despite being probono. All we ask is some basic respect on leveling as a human being thanks. Mr. How Sek Kwong is especially professional, never fails to answer your queries patiently and pretty good with acupuncture as per photo. Some reviews are saying he is very good with medicine and general consultation too.

They dont allow collection of medicine and general consultation together with acupuncture now so this means you may see a different physician for your illness in dispensing the meds. I really am not quite sure how this would be more time saving or efficient. Its a new thing, and this means an additional physician must do the work seeing you, while your acupuncturist still did the same things reading your pulse.

My GP doesn't work on Saturdays, so I found Medivale near my place through Google reviews. After visiting, I observed that Dr. Phua is kind, friendly, professional, and meticulous. She genuinely listens, asks for detailed medical information, and truly cares‚ÄîI could feel it.

I visited on Sat morning around 9:30 AM and was likely the first patient. By the time I stepped out, there were about 5 to 7 people waiting. The clinic is very clean, and the clinic assistant is okay‚Äîshe gives clear instructions in a monotone manner but isn‚Äôt rude, which is fine.

The Google reviews show 3.7 stars, but personally, I would give it 4 stars for my first visit.

I came back for a review on 17 Dec around 12:10, just before the clinic‚Äôs lunch break. There were a few people ahead of me. A parent was explaining to the clinic assistant that her child needed immediate medical attention and medication. Despite the timing, Ivy didn‚Äôt turn them away, even though it probably cut into her lunch break. While I noticed a few negative reviews about Ivy here, my second experience showed she is kind, approachable, and helpful. It‚Äôs a good reminder for me not to judge a book by its cover.

I was baffled to hear this as i made an appointment online at around 7pm. If the clinic was overwhelmed, the staff could have contacted me and advised me on the situation and provided alternative clinics to visit instead.

I truly do not appreciate how the staff handled the whole situation. They told me they weren't taking in appointments. Until questioned further, they kept repeating that there were more than 10 patients in-front of me and i had to wait despite having an appointment.

When I shared my frustrations on how the clinic was wasting my time, one staff said "" we have no control over the online system."" I am very sorry but this is not acceptable at all.

The resident doctor, while well-meaning, has demonstrated an inability to listen and consider basic diagnoses - even when directly suggested to him from a fellow doctor (we only had to see him because of conflict of interest otherwise). He seemed more keen to talk about his fancy equipment - an ophthalmoscope, an ultrasound, and his interest in dermatoscopy, whilst almost completely ignoring the basic condition that we saw him for. These things may look fancy but are definitely no substitute for basic clinical skills.

Separately, the clinic administration is incredibly inept even at the most basic of regular tasks - submitting my FDW‚Äôs 6ME results to MOM.

Lifeline Medical Group Sengkang,1,"I am writing to formally lodge a complaint about the unprofessional and inconsiderate behavior of two nurses at Lifeline Medical Group in Sengkang during my mother‚Äôs visit to your clinic on 19th August. My mother, who was suffering from a high fever and was visibly weak, visited your clinic alone seeking medical attention. Unfortunately, the treatment she received from your nursing staff was deeply disappointing and far below the standard of care expected from a healthcare provider.
Upon arriving at the clinic, my mother requested a face mask, likely due to her condition and to ensure the safety of others. Instead of assisting her with empathy or offering a solution, the nurses at the counter informed her that masks were not provided for free. They instructed her to leave the clinic, search for a mask elsewhere, and return for her consultation. This response was not only dismissive but also highly inconsiderate, given her weakened state and urgent need for medical attention. Forcing a sick patient to leave the premises to obtain a mask, without any offer of assistance or alternative, is unacceptable and contrary to the principles of compassionate healthcare.
As healthcare professionals, your nursing staff are expected to uphold a duty of care, showing kindness and understanding to patients, especially those who are vulnerable. The behavior exhibited by these nurses was rude, lacked empathy, and failed to reflect the values of Lifeline Medical Group as a trusted healthcare provider in our community. This incident left my mother feeling humiliated and neglected, which is deeply disheartening.
I urge Lifeline Medical Group to investigate this matter thoroughly and take appropriate disciplinary action to address the conduct of the involved staff members. Additionally, I recommend that your clinic implement measures, such as staff training on patient care and empathy, to prevent such incidents from recurring. Ensuring that all patients are treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their circumstances, should be a priority for your organization.",2025-08-19T15:47:58.935Z,education

Lifeline Medical Group Sengkang,1,"I am writing to express my disappointment regarding the rude behaviour I experienced during my recent visit to your clinic for a check-up. As it was my first time at your clinic, I was unfamiliar with your procedures.
After my consultation, I informed the nurse handling the billing that my visit was covered under a corporate account. Instead of responding with understanding, she reacted with visible frustration and said, ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you say earlier? Now I have to key in everything again.‚Äù I explained that I wasn‚Äôt aware of the process, and that in other clinics, the staff would usually ask if it‚Äôs a corporate visit. That‚Äôs why I mentioned it before making any payment.
Throughout the process, both nurses continued to speak in an angry tone in Chinese, which made me feel uncomfortable and disrespected.
After they completed everything, they did not even inform me that the transaction was settled and that I had nothing to pay. I stood there awkwardly passing her my card for payment, unsure if I could leave, and had to ask twice if everything was done. One of the nurses finally responded in a curt and irritated tone, saying, ‚ÄúYes, done already. No need to pay.‚Äù Her tone was uncalled for and left me feeling embarrassed and unwelcome.
I believe that patients especially first-time visitors should be treated with patience, professionalism, and respect. I hope you will look into this matter and take appropriate steps to ensure that other patients do not go through a similar experience.",2025-07-01T11:19:28.110Z,Hotels

Lifeline Medical Group Sengkang,1,"I am writing to express my deep concern and disappointment regarding the treatment my father received at your clinic on 11 Feb 2025 around 6.30pm . He recently suffered a severe fall, resulting in a deep cut that required 10 stitches. Seeking immediate medical attention, he came to your clinic for help.

For the past 20 years, our family has trusted your clinic and relied on your services whenever we were in need of medical care. We have always appreciated the care provided by your team, especially given that all of your staff are senior professionals whom we have seen for many years. However, on this occasion, we were deeply disappointed by the lack of care and attention shown.

Despite your clinic not having the necessary facilities for stitching, basic care and compassion could have been offered. Instead of providing any assistance, such as covering the wound to prevent infection, or even guiding him to the nearest hospital, your staff allowed him to leave without any proper wound care. He was left to travel to the hospital on his own, which is not only unacceptable but also concerning given his condition.

It is crucial to highlight that if infection had set in during his journey, it could have led to severe complications. As a healthcare facility, I expected a minimum level of care, such as first aid, to help stabilize the situation until he could receive proper treatment.

Given our long-standing relationship with your clinic, and the fact that we‚Äôve always had confidence in the senior staff, this experience was deeply disheartening. The lack of support left my father vulnerable to further harm and demonstrates a worrying disregard for patient safety. I request that you look into this matter seriously and take the necessary steps to ensure that such a situation never happens again.

I would appreciate a prompt response to address this issue, as well as an explanation of the actions you will take to improve the care provided at your clinic moving forward. MOH will be informed of this situation as well.",2025-02-16T06:01:27.475Z,Hotels

FAITH Healthcare (Rivervale) Clinic,1,"My son had fever and flu yesterday, therefore need to consult doctor for medical certification. He went to FAITH Healthcare (Rivervale) for doctor consultation, the doctor advised him to take influenza swab and prescribed him with 8 medicines.   This caused him a bill of $152, unbelievable!

Despite my son has informed the doctor that he went to Polyclinic on the day before (Saturday) and he was prescribed with flu and sore throat medicines from the poly doctor, the doctor from FAITH still prescribed him with flu and sore throat medicines, which I find that is unnecessary.  Or that‚Äôs how the clinic charges the patient with a hefty sum without considering the financial capability of the patient?

Secondly, the receipt from the clinic is without any breakdown of line items charges, just showing a single line of charge for $152.  There is no transparency and the itemized bill will only be presented upon request.

I suggest the residents at Rivervale to request a detailed bill and check on the charges before you make any payment.",2024-10-14T04:54:45.681Z,Retail
Northshore Family Clinic (Punggol Point),1,"Unpleasant experience with the clinic's queue management.
I was the first in line waiting for the clinic to open at 8.30am.
The staff came on time at 8.30am but were not ready to open so I was seated outside with another male patient waiting to be called in.

However after completing their setup, the staff did not even bother to inform us that they have opened for operation and we are only aware when an elderly woman cut queue by barging in straight into the clinic.

I was assigned #2 (despite being first in line) while the male patient was #3. The lady who cut queue was initially assigned to #4 but after pressuring the nurse, she was given #1 instead.

I can understand that the staff may move patient up the queue for medical emergency, but when patient #1 arrived (a child with her two parents, the elderly lady who pressured the nurse came earlier than them to get a queue number), she was clearly not in any medical emergency and it appears that they just want to get attended quickly at the expense of others with the nurses facilitating.

Then when queue #2 (me) was called in, the doctor mistaken me for another patient #3 which turns out have been moved up to my queue by one of the nurse as he was complaining. But I stood my ground since I had already given my first spot to another patient and would not accept being pushed to the back of the queue.

in summary:
- Me --> #2 even though first in line, subsequently moved to #3
- Male patient --> #3, subsequently moved to #2 for no reason
- Elderly lady --> #4, moved to queue #1 after pressuring nurses.

Lastly I was prescribed a medication with only around 1 year to expiration out of it's 3 years manufacturing lifecycle, but was told that it's the only batch they have and I was left with no choice but to take it.

I hope the management will look into this issue seriously and make improvements.",2025-08-21T01:46:06.144Z,Arts

Northshore Family Clinic (Punggol Point),2,"Visited on a Tuesday morning about 9.30am by the time I left the clinic
Nurse at the reception called to give medication after consult and during the first medication given I noticed there were instructions that she missed out saying on the box (it says take once daily and then start with 2 tablets at the last line) so I clarified with her and she answered super impatiently and said all information on the box (basically asking me to read and comprehend it myself). I responded by telling her that it's medication and therefore I would like for it to be explained properly especially when it comes to dosage. She proceeded to answer super impatiently to say ""okay what is it that you want"" and then proceed to rush through the remaining medication and blocked the instructions so I could not ask anymore questions. Before I left, I shared with her my feedback - in which I told her that while I understand the clinic is busy, I do not think the level of service should be compromised especially when it comes to medication and explaining the dosage etc. and guess what, she just replied okay and did not even apologize or make sure she went through the medications again.

Bridgepoint Health (Everton Park Clinic),1,"I've always had a wonderful experience at A Medical, but today was a disappointment with Bridgepoint Health with the new doctor Dr. Siva.

I went in for a simple issue, pain in my thumb. Dr. Siva talked a lot on how he doesn't know insurance and what to claim and suggest that I go hand surgeon... He did not tell me if he's going to prescribe me anything to treat the pain or diagnose what my issue is.  He just referred me to a hand surgeon.

When I asked who he suggest I can see, he said the panel on my insurance doctor. I told him, can he give me some recommended surgeons so I can check if they are on my insurance panel.... He then asked me to wait, I waited for 10mins and he brought another doctor in to explain and who assured me that he will recommend me a doctor and advised me to check if they are in my insurance panel. That was exactly what I had asked for!!

To my shock and horror, Dr. Siva then charged me EXTENDED consult WITHOUT informing me. I only realized it when I paid.

Maybe he knew I was claiming, it is very irresponsible that he told me to wait in the room and then charged me extra for long time WITHOUT informing.

I will not pursue this as I am claiming this from travel insurance but I have to provide this feedback. I have been with A Medical for years since they opened, but this has been very UNPLEASANT.

It makes me question the ethics of doctors... Whether they are here to treat patients or to get paid more for their time.",2025-04-09T07:10:20.037Z,food and beverages

Bridgepoint Health (Everton Park Clinic),3,"This is a great clinic that I found in my neighbourhood recently. The doctors are good, and it has a seamless online booking system. Having said that, its queue management process has a big room for improvement, hence I only put 3 stars.

I made an appointment and was at the clinic yesterday, yet the queue was 45 minutes long before it was my toddler's turn. Because she was unwell, she became tireless and was crying non stop after the long wait. It was unnecessarily stressful for me onsite as a parent.

Today, I headed down to the clinic as I was also not feeling well myself. Despite that I made a booking on the system for 4.15pm slot, made an effort to be punctual, the nurse registered me and confirmed that I am the next one to go in .... I was unexpectedly stopped to go in at the last minute. This was because a man appeared at the counter after me to register himself, and the nurse said he should go in first as his booking was 4pm which was before mine (4.15pm).

This is the part that buffles me. The previous patient was late for his reserved time slot, and I made an effort to be on time for mine, yet my turn gets pushed out even if the late comer comes in physically later than me in the clinic. This process gives no incentive for patients to make accurate appointment booking in the system and make effort to be punctual. Does that mean next time I should just randomly book an early time slot and come later, since I will still be prioritised at the clinic? I explained to the nurse, but I was dismissed, she did not understand where I was coming from.

After being failed by the seemingly-good online booking system, my confidence for this clinic has dropped significantly. I was intending to make this clinic my family clinic in the long run, but I don't think I can afford the unjustified long waiting time for every subsequent visit. I hope the management can look into the matter to regain patients' confidence for this promising clinic in the neighbourhood.",2025-01-24T09:18:33.649Z,education

Cough especially is a nightmare, I had not have a good night since and it‚Äôs taking its toll on my mental clarity. The nurses, which I read from earlier reviews got negative comments- I am new and first time to this clinic I would say at start they are more aloof, and the mannerism they speak may not be the norm societal expected gentle ‚Äòmi see‚Äô tone but I would like to be fair to say- they are still professional who gets their job done- registrating for me and taking my BP before seeing Dr. And a grandma w walking difficulties walked in for a vac jab and one of the nurse hurried to ask her to sit down and instead of going to the room, she brought the jab for her to be done at the general area. I think there is still compassion. I have no bad comments about them, in fact when I was out to collect meds- it was mutual courteous exchange of convo (keyword here is: mutual) and we even chatted saying that the wave of flu and cough and wish each other good health.

Dr Chung, not to be missed. He is patient and detailed in explaining the possible cause for my irritation and cough. Asked for my medical history, whether I was on any long term medications.

I have been visiting Dr Chung for close to 3 years. He has been monitoring my BP and my medication. Recently I had some chest discomfort but was releuctant to go for further tests. Dr Chung advised me to go for CT scan which I didn‚Äôt want to. I opted for a referral to heart centre for me for a follow. Before referral, he advised me to take an ECG at his clinic. The first reading was not good. He informed me that there is a high chance of a blockage. I was not able to accept this.

I asked to take ECG for a second time. He kindly obliged and the results were the same. I followed his advise and the next day went for further tests and found out that I had a severe blockage and did angioplasty. Not to mention that my ECG at Mount Elizabeth was also normal. The cardiologist asked what is the issue as my ECG is normal. Then I showed the readings taken at Dr Chung. Then we went for further test.

We've been seeing Dr Teng since my son was born in June 2023, because we were looking for a kind doctor who could administer vaccines smoothly and not cause unnecessary distress (we had a bad experience at a polyclinic nearby).

This was particularly frustrating as I had planned my visit based on the published closing time.

While I understand that unforeseen circumstances can occur, it is crucial for a clinic to adhere to its posted hours or to communicate any changes clearly to avoid such inconvenience. Patients rely on these hours to plan their visits, and not honoring them or providing clear updates can cause unnecessary frustration and stress.

I hope this feedback helps the clinic address these issues and improve their service in the future. For now, I would advise potential visitors to confirm operating hours directly with the clinic before planning their visit.",2024-08-12T08:52:04.332Z,Retail

I visited her for an annual health screening, blood test, and a flu vaccination. She patiently took the time to listen attentively to my concerns, and helping me to customize the health screening package that was relevant and affordable for my needs. She‚Äôs indubitably driven by what her patient needs and definitely not in the business of making a quick profit. For instance, like any patient who thought doing more tests is better as it‚Äôs more comprehensive, she actually advised me to opt out certain unnecessary costly tests that were not needed for my age and condition.

Her expertise and dedication to her craft were evident in every interaction, instilling confidence and trust in her care. My flu vaccination was a breeze and wasn‚Äôt painful at all.

I left her clinic feeling empowered and reassured, knowing that I was in capable hands. What impressed me the most was her genuine follow-ups post the medical appointment, giving gentle nudges and checking in on the progress of my diet and exercise plan.

"Parkway Shenton Medical Clinic, Punggol Oasis",1,"I brought my NS son to Parkway Shenton Oasis this morning and, unfortunately, had a very unpleasant experience with this clinic. Before coming, I had already read some negative reviews about this clinic and was slightly concerned, but since this clinic is near our home, we decided to give it a try.
There were two doctors on duty and the queue moved fairly quickly, so we thought things would be smooth. However, when it was our turn, Dr Koh‚Äôs very first question was whether my son was an NS personnel. The moment we said yes, he immediately remarked, ‚ÄúWhy not go and see the MO instead of coming here?‚Äù His tone and body language suggested that we were wasting his time. It felt as though he had already judged my son as someone trying to ‚Äúchao keng‚Äù (skive), instead of treating him as a genuine patient who was unwell.
We had to explain ourselves further before he reluctantly began his examination. Throughout, his attitude seemed dismissive and unempathetic. While he did eventually issue a one-day MC, the entire consultation left us feeling belittled and uncomfortable‚Äîcompletely unnecessary for a patient who is already unwell.
On a positive note, the receptionist, Xin Yi, was professional, friendly and approachable. Her good service was the only saving grace of our visit and helped lighten the experience.
That said, we will not be returning to this clinic in the future, even if it means travelling further. A patient deserves to be treated with respect and empathy, not with suspicion or disdain.",2025-08-26T01:12:30.787Z,retail

Silver Cross Medical (Holland),5,"Silver Cross Clinic in Holland Village has been my go-to general practitioner for several years now, and I continue to be impressed by the consistently high standard of care provided. The clinic is run by a male and a female doctor, both of whom are not only highly competent but also incredibly patient, kind, and thorough in their consultations.

What truly sets them apart is the genuine care and attention they give to each patient. Whether it‚Äôs a routine check-up or a more complex health concern, they take the time to listen carefully and explain things clearly, without rushing. I‚Äôve witnessed them handle difficult or impatient patients with calm professionalism and empathy‚Äîsomething not all clinics manage well.

Despite the clinic often being busy, especially during peak hours, the waiting time remains quite reasonable considering the quality of service. I usually go early in the morning, just as they open, to be among the first, which I‚Äôve found to be a good strategy if you're on a tight schedule.

It‚Äôs clear that both doctors are dedicated to maintaining a high level of service, and their consistency over time is something I truly value. In an age where many clinics feel rushed or impersonal, Silver Cross stands out as a place where patients are genuinely cared for.

If you're looking for a trustworthy and compassionate GP in the Holland Village area, I highly recommend Silver Cross Clinic. You‚Äôll be in good hands.",2025-05-26T03:17:24.993Z,Food & Beverage

I was extremely frustrated ‚Äî not only had we been sitting there waiting with a sick toddler, but no one informed us about the change in doctor or the fact that the next doctor wouldn‚Äôt be able to help. When I asked what could be done, the receptionist simply told me to come back tomorrow. That‚Äôs not a solution when a young child is unwell.

told me they were no longer accepting new patients. I mentioned I was really pain hard to walk any more, almost beg if I could go in to quickly see doctor and get medicine.

If it was another institution, I could partially understand but you are clinic. Refusing to accept new patients when they were in great pain and the business hours were not completely over, this behavior refreshed my understanding of clinic.

Healthway Medical (Jurong West Central),5,"Visited the clinic for a medical examination and my experience was very pleasant!

Interaction with the nurse at the reception was a pleasure, as she was professional, patient and spoke with a gentle tone. There was another nurse working at the reception as well that I did not interact with directly, but was working in a professional manner as well; dealing with phone calls and speaking in a very amiable tone.
Both individuals were doing an excellent job keeping a peaceful and calm environment despite having ~7-8 people patients in the waiting room at any given time, they kept the flow moving smoothly.

During the medical examinations itself, both the reception nurse that was assisting - as well as the female doctor were thoughtful and sensitive in the way they spoke/handled me as a patient. I believe that that level of professionalism is priceless in the healthcare sector - as being a patient is a vulnerable experience.

The entire appointment lasted for a little over an hour, which was very reasonable - all factors put into consideration.

Overall, the clinic floor run by efficient and compassionate women is indeed a powerhouse in my book.

I also want to give a big shout-out to the nurses who took my blood. Even though I have tricky veins, they were so patient and reassuring. They never once made me feel embarrassed or uncomfortable. Instead, they kept checking in, apologizing for any difficulty, and making sure I was okay.

Health Partners Medical Clinic (Raffles Place),2,"I visited this clinic today because I‚Äôve been experiencing occasional sharp pain in my rectal area, and I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was hemorrhoids or something more serious. While the registration process was fast and the receptionist was polite and welcoming, my experience with the doctor was quite disappointing.

The doctor seemed impatient, dismissive, and inattentive. When I explained my symptoms‚Äîoccasional sharp pain in my butt‚Äîand mentioned that I suspected hemorrhoids, he asked me twice why I was there, as if I hadn‚Äôt just explained it. I had to repeat myself and reiterate that I was worried about hemorrhoids and wanted treatment if necessary.

When he asked how long I‚Äôd been having these symptoms, I said about a month. His response coupled with his facial expression, ‚ÄúThen why are you only coming today?‚Äù felt accusatory, as though he doubted my symptoms or my intentions for seeking care. I also mentioned that I sometimes notice blood in my stool, to which he replied, ‚ÄúJust now you said you didn‚Äôt have blood in your stool,‚Äù which i did not say i didn‚Äôt have blood in my stool, revealing that he wasn‚Äôt fully paying attention to what I was saying.

When I asked whether the issue would resolve completely with medication, his answer was a curt, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù When I expressed concern about whether it could be something serious, like colon cancer, his response was, again, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù I understand that not every question has an immediate answer, but there‚Äôs a more professional way to communicate uncertainty without making a patient feel dismissed.

A quick rectal examination was done, and the doctor mentioned that if symptoms persist, he would refer me to a specialist for a more thorough examination. However, what I don‚Äôt understand is why the doctor was so rude and impatient when I had already made it clear why I was there‚Äîto address rectal pain and check for hemorrhoids.

Overall, this experience left me feeling unheard, dismissed, and dissatisfied with the care provided. Patients come to a clinic because they are worried about their health and need help, not to feel belittled or brushed off. I hope the clinic takes this feedback seriously and ensures a more professional and empathetic approach from its doctors in the future.",2024-12-04T04:59:13.788Z,Retail

I told the doctor, Damien Lee, when I arrived at the clinic that I had hurt my leg, but he never even looked at the condition of my feet; instead, he presumed I had a bunion and gave me painkillers and muscle relaxants without asking me to have an x-ray. I initially told him that I tripped on the carpet and I was able to maintain my equilibrium without falling, but I also told him that I had hurt a joint. Not professional at all, even when I ask the doctor where the location of x-ray is, he doesn't seem to care to response.

I have yet to hear from him about whether the x-ray was successful. What kind of service is he giving if he doesn't check the condition of my feet?

The nurses were not skilled at drawing blood‚Äîfinding veins was difficult and painful. One male doctor, who was tall and slim and had some difficulty moving around, appeared to delay issuing test reports to encourage patients to undergo additional tests in their clinic with unreasonable prices. Moreover, if you choose to have tests done outside their clinic, they charge extra high fees, seemingly to pressure you into opting for those overpriced and non-transparent tests within their facility.

Minmed Clinic (Jurong East),1,"Came to redo a urine test after a health screening with Minmed. When I did the online teleconsult with a Dr, he asked me to just redo the urine test with a dipstick test. Concerned about the cost, I asked how much it would be and he said $12. However when I went to the outlet, I was told that I have to see the dr on duty for consultation first before I can redo my urine test, and that was chargeable. Feels quite ridiculous and scammy that I have to pay to consult another Dr when I already spoke to a Dr on teleconsult.
But I went ahead with it anyway and the dr on duty said that he will recommend me to do the lab test instead of dipstick. He explained why and I said ok. Again, I enquired about the cost so as not to get any shock. He said it was about $12 and I could check the actual amount at the front desk.
The front desk then passed me the pee sample bottle and told me that the test & consult will be $100+. I was shocked but eventually had to agree to it since I was already there and they checked with the dr who insisted on the lab test. Disappointing experience as the dr should be better informed and more transparent on prices. $12 vs $100 is very different. Minmed should review the unnecessary step of 2 dr consults. Also, it is concerning that there is a disparity on the tests that different doctors are ordering.",2025-08-08T06:54:09.600Z,Hotels

Minmed Clinic (Jurong East),1,"Terrible terrible service.
Scheduled an appointment for vaccine and I arrived on time to clinic. 2 uninterested clinic assistants attended to me. The simple explanation is vaccine did not arrive and is ‚Äò on the way‚Äô. The lady by the name of Sha has poor communication skills. Despite the fact that I look all confused and flustered, she clearly is very short with her answers.
I asked her why no one called to informed that the vaccine was not in yet and someone should ask me not to come. She said vaccine is on the way. I asked when and she said it is on the way and asked me not to shout at her. At no time did I shout at her.
I again raised the questions on why no one called me. Instead she told me that someone also came for vaccine in the morning and can‚Äôt do it as the vaccine was not in yet.
The clear question at this point is that they should inform patients who set up appointment not to come until the vaccine is in the clinic. She again replied that vaccine is on the way.
This kind of evasive attitude is clearly irresponsible and unprofessional.
I told her that I want her name and the HQ number.
She said she did not have the HQ number and asked me to go online to get it. When I refused to do that, she asked her colleague to attend to me when her colleague was talking to another patient.
I have been going to Minmed for vaccine and clearly I won‚Äôt go again.

Minmed Clinic (Jurong East),1,"I visited the clinic on 18th June at about for an ear infection at 7plus in the evening. I was only given normal olive oil ear drops and a week supply of antibiotics, despite the doctor informing that he would provide another ear drop with antibiotics. the bill came up to be a hefty $45 + $10. The malay receptionist was extremely rude. on 20th June, they came back and demanded me to pay another $22.85 and only to correct themselves and claim that the bill is $12.85.

I suffered more than 1 week without proper ear drops and situation did not improve. Luckily the second time, i made the right choice not to go back to them and visited another trusted clinic. This time, my trusted doctor at another clinic told me that i was given old and less effective antibiotics. Furthermore, with the absence of proper ear drops it is no surprise that my infection did not get better.

I asked her what‚Äôs the approximate waiting time and she told me 20minutes. So I sat there and waited. In between, more people registered (they do not have prior appt as the receptionist asked during registration and they were given queue numbers from 60 onwards). They proceeded to call for queue numbers up to 64, letting me wait there while people who just came got called before me. It was also already 6.47pm by then and I went to ask the receiptionist why were people coming and registering after me seeing the doctor first. She told me queue numbers would not be called in sequence. I‚Äôm ok with it not being called in sequence as I understand that there might also be others who might have made prior appt beforehand but there were none during the duration while I was in the clinic.

When I arrived at the clinic today, the counter staff informed me that this branch does not have X-ray facilities and suggested that I go to the Jurong Point branch instead to complete the full check-up (blood test + X-ray), since I would be heading there anyway.

This information was not clearly stated during the online booking process. The website only mentions that X-ray services are available on weekdays from 9am‚Äì5pm, but does not indicate that this branch does not offer X-ray at all. If such a crucial part of the check-up isn‚Äôt available at the location, it should have been made very clear during appointment booking.

Little Woods Montessori,5,"I had stalled sending my son (second child) to preschool after we moved to Singapore simply because I could not find a preschool that was as wonderful as the school his older sister had attended in our home country. I visited what seemed like every single preschool in our area and none of them ""clicked"" for me. That was until I visited Little Woods Montessori in Gentle Road. From the moment I stepped into the light, bright and beautiful ground-floor converted home - I knew I had finally found my son's preschool! The surroundings are so wonderful for a young child, it really feels like a home away from home rather than a learning institution. I was most impressed that day by witnessing what the children were doing. The activities are so wonderful for the body and mind. My son has absolutely thrived at Little Woods Montessori over the past two years. His fine motor skills are absolutely amazing and his knowledge of the world is beyond his years! The teaching and environment has been so incredibly nurturing. It is wonderful that they get to play outside on the grass playground in the fresh air every day! I have always felt that my son has been in safe hands and the teacher to student ratio is very low so they really get to know your child so well. As a family we have greatly enjoyed the Open House exhibitions over the years and have been amazed by what our son has created. Our only regret has been that we did not keep our son at Little Woods the whole way through until Age 6. We moved him after two years to his older sister's international school for the sake of convenience. At the international school, he is just a ""number"" and I have now realised just how incredibly high the teaching standards and care were at Little Woods! So I would have two pieces of advice for anyone wishing to send their child to a preschool in Singapore: First, you cannot go past Little Woods Montessori for the environment and quality of teaching and care. Second: Leave your child at Little Woods for as long as you can, you will find the standards of teaching and care at the ""big"" or international schools do not compare! We miss Little Woods so much and are very thankful for the incredible time our son has had there and for all of the valuable things that he has learnt.",2020-02-27T03:20:06.241Z,Food & Beverage

Guests can also look forward to enjoying the weekly yacht service which shuttles them between the main island and the resort. The hotel staff are also not exactly friendly and shout at guests from time to time, but were still marginally better than what i expected before my stay here.

MindChamps PreSchool @ Pasir Ris,5,"Our son has been attending MindChamps Pasir Ris for the past two months, and our experience so far has been very positive. As a first-time mother who practiced full-time caregiving for the first 18 months, transitioning to preschool was a big step‚Äînot just for our son, but for us as well.

While he still cries at drop-off, he now verbalises that he enjoys school and adores his teachers. We‚Äôre especially grateful for Ms Banu, Gu Lao Shi, and Ms Pearlyn, who have shown great patience, care, and attentiveness. Their nurturing approach has made a meaningful impact, and we‚Äôve noticed our son learning to respect both authority and his peers‚Äîsomething we truly appreciate.

The recent parent-teacher conference only reinforced our trust in the school. During the 45-minute session, Ms Pearlyn and Ms Banu took the time to understand our concerns and worked with us to brainstorm practical, thoughtful strategies tailored to our son's needs. It was clear they see him as an individual, and we felt genuinely supported as partners in his development.

The school itself is clean, very new, and well-maintained. We also appreciate the emphasis on sensory play and Chinese language exposure. A big plus: our son hasn‚Äôt fallen sick once since he started, which speaks volumes about the hygiene standards in place.

One small point of feedback would be the lighting‚Äîit tends to be on the cooler side, like in an office. We hope there might be a way to introduce warmer lighting in certain areas to create a cozier, more relaxed vibe.

Overall, we absolutely recommend MindChamps Pasir Ris. The teachers are dedicated, the environment is safe and enriching, and most importantly, our child is learning and growing in a space where he feels seen, supported, and secure.",2025-06-05T03:18:08.362Z,retail
MindChamps PreSchool @ Pasir Ris,5,"We recently enrolled our child in the playgroup at the Pasir Ris Mall center, and it‚Äôs been such a positive experience so far.

The teachers have been incredibly patient, caring, and clearly take pride in what they do. They work so well as a team and create a warm, welcoming environment for all the children.

We really appreciate how they bring in extra support when needed and keep us updated on our child‚Äôs progress‚Äîit‚Äôs reassuring to know that they‚Äôre so attentive and proactive. I am writing this after just one week of school,  we can see our child slowly settling in and adjusting to the new routine, which brings us a lot of comfort.

MindChamps PreSchool @ Pasir Ris,5,"My 21 month old daughter has recently started PG with Mind champs at Pasir Ris and had a great experience with the school. We actually enrolled her into another premium school previously but felt very uncomfortable with the school just after 2 days as we felt the teachers were ‚Äútoo busy‚Äù and too overwhelmed to care for her. It felt like she was just one of the numbers in the class. The experience left me and my husband very heartbroken as we were disappointed to see our precious child being neglected at school. However, the experience with Mind champs Pasir Ris mall was a total positive change. Ms Banu (English teacher) Gu Lao Shi (Chinese teacher ) and Ms Kwee Xin (music teacher) were extremely caring and dedicated. They made sure to help my daughter feel at ease, welcomed and gave her the necessary care and attention she needed, even helped to feed and try to finish her meals when she was not adept at using the spoon (the previous school wouldn‚Äôt bother and would just remove her food once the time was up if it wasn‚Äôt touched ) . We as parents feel blessed and grateful that we found this school under Mrs Koh and Ms Pearlyn‚Äôs leadership where they hire teachers who genuinely love children. Our daughter almost immediately loved her teachers and would even tell us that she wants to go to school just after 1 week of starting.

The teachers throughout his Mindchamps journey has been nothing but wonderful. Caring, loving and with a passion to nurture, our child has blossomed in the time he has spent with them. The school environment is very clean and hygienic, school culture warm and welcoming. The outdoor area is a major plus point for us when choosing a preschool as we very much wanted outdoor play for our child. The outdoor space also doubles up as learning venue for a different kind of exposure and learning experience for the kids.

The Mindchamps programmes are very interesting and we appreciate that they encourage exploratory learning with the kids. Themes are set through each term with activities focusing  around the various themes. Lessons as I hear from our child are interesting, lively and very enjoyable. It‚Äôs a brilliant way for young minds to learn. Kudos to the teachers for always going the extra mile to creatively impart knowledge.

Feedback from us parents are taken seriously and always addressed promptly which is something we appreciate a lot. Parent teacher conferences are held periodically on top of the updates we get on our child. This is always welcomed - afterall it is a partnership between us parents and teachers.

It is hard to say goodbye to such a great preschool. Our son speaks very fondly still of his preschool days and has asked for frequent visits back. It has been one of our best decisions to enrol him in Mindchamps!",2023-03-08T12:59:31.992Z,Hotels

Our experience with the school, has been nothing but amazing- right from highlighting details about the child‚Äôs progress and potential, to encouraging the child with patience every step of the way-the teachers have always had and have ‚Äòthe child first‚Äô policy.

Aside the learning and thinking skills imparted, when combined with dance and drama (also an integrated part of the curriculum), truly ensures that the child is blossoming comprehensively- and what‚Äôs more, these are not empty words- we can vouch as a first hand experience of this with our child :).

Asides this, what we also really like about the infrastructure/ space of this school - is that unlike a few other preschools which are located in malls etc- this one has a playground- which is really great as the kids can get to be in a more ‚Äúnatural‚Äù environment while the teachers oversee all the play activities.

Finally, a very important factor in considering MindChamps CBP has always been how welcoming, engaged and receptive the whole team is right from the start- they always allays any concerns and address any questions the parents may have and this give us the confidence to know that our child is in a safe and conducive environment geared for growth.",2023-03-05T06:23:20.679Z,food and beverages

Perfect outdoor and indoor location where kids have a dedicated area for waterplay and their own playground! This was important to us as we wanted our child to spend time in the sun too! Teachers also incorporated learning in the outdoor play to help kids to truly understand concepts.

Teachers are prompt in responding to parents and always see themselves as a team with parents. This is a wonderful way of raising kids. In PG and Nursery, the focus is very much on social skills and interacting well with others while still keeping up with academic developments. In kindergarten, teachers focus on building independence with the kids and preparing them for primary school. Mindchamps CBP also has drama, ballet and music classes so kids are kept actively engaged in their interests.

Food menus are shared with parents in advanced so you know what your kids are being fed. Always lovingly cooked fresh and kids also have sessions where they try their hand at preparing simple dishes.

Excellent facilities, educators, quality of feedback etc. My girl looks forward to school each day. And we do see her progress really well in her speech, confidence and other aspects of her development evey single week.

We did, for a period of one or two weeks, try to send her to another operator but the drop in standard was really alot to accept.

The teachers are incredibly personable and attentive, making both the parents and children feel comfortable and valued. They go above and beyond in their care and vigilance. For instance, they were the first to notice my child's cow milk protein allergy when it could have been easily dismissed as colic. This attention to detail gave us significant comfort, showing how closely they monitor each child's health and well-being.

We thought it was a small compound from the outside but we were wrong, as the school went through a renovation in 2018/2019 to expand its facility. The principal explained and shared patiently what we asked as we were anxious to find a school for our daughter. She assured us that the teachers have been working with them for many years as we do not want to stress our child with high teacher turnover. My daughter cried for 1st month as she was unfamiliar with the routine, fast forward 5 months later she is enjoying school everyday. The teacher will update us if they notice if my daughter was feeling unwell, recently she had an ear infection. We felt that we picked the right school for her as the teachers‚Äôs care and attention were most important. Recently we celebrated ur daughter‚Äôs birthday at school, we are surprised that teachers and principal coordinated with us as we like to have unicorn-theme (we supplied the balloons) and our daughter was thrilled when she saw the decoration.

This childcare has very good dedicated teachers, good communication between parents and cleanliness. My children fall sick minimally, accidents almost never happen, its very important, so I can focus on my job.

Little Gryphons Montessori,5,"If you're looking for a school where your child will develop both valuable academic and life skills while building meaningful friendships, and looking forward to going to school every morning, look no further.

My son has been attending Little Gryphons Montessori since he was 3 years old. He's now 6 and preparing to say goodbye to the school and the friends he's made over the years. Looking back, I can say for a fact that I have never once regretted enrolling him at Little Gryphons (LG).

This is a school rooted in strong values, with lots of warmth and plenty of heart. It offers a safe, nurturing environment where children are encouraged to become confident, independent individuals. The transformation is evident ‚Äî children who once arrived shy and unsure gradually blossom into bright, curious, and expressive little people who aren‚Äôt afraid to ask questions or share their thoughts. This is a testament to the school‚Äôs thoughtful unstifling approach and the positive influence of its teachers.

The school itself is well-maintained and spotless, with high-quality, mostly wooden materials that provide a calm and enriching environment for the children. I'm especially fond of the spacious layout, which emphasizes togetherness.

The teaching staff are nothing short of exceptional ‚Äî nurturing, patient, and kind. They succeed in the challenging feat of making learning enjoyable for today‚Äôs children. A notable sign of the positive culture at LG is its low teacher turnover ‚Äî in three years, I recall only one teacher being replaced. That level of consistency and stability speaks volumes, and is crucial in the children's development.

A heartfelt thank you to:
- Teacher Jameema, for your genuine interest in the children, your unwavering care, kindness, and dedication;
- Teacher Jess for sparking a genuine interest in Mandarin among the kids;
- Teacher Letchimi, for your irresistible bubbliness and bright energy (never change! :-));
- Peh Laoshi for your sweet, calm demeanour;

And of course, a big shoutout to Jacqueline and Terrence for setting up such a wonderful school. Little Gryphons was everything I hoped for when I was searching for a place where Adrian could thrive. I couldn‚Äôt be more proud of the thoughtful, curious, and happy little man he‚Äôs become.

To the whole Team LG: Keep up the excellent work. You‚Äôre shaping young lives in the most beautiful way - we will miss you all dearly!

Little Gryphons Montessori,5,"My experience of Little Gryphons:

In January 2018 we enrolled our daughter of 19 months to Little Gryphons Montessori School.

As a working mummy, with a new baby on the way, we knew she would be needing some extra interaction with other children and wanted to settle her in before the baby arrived.  As an expat in Singapore this is not a decision we took lightly as in the UK usually we would wait a few years before play groups and any form of education began.

We visited with Little Gryphons and spoke to several teachers who talked very thoroughly through their Montessori approach daily routine and activities. After sitting down and talking with the teachers we were bowled over with the LOVE, PASSION and DRIVE expressed by all of them.

We left the meeting feeling overwhelmed and truly confident that this was the right descision and perfect school for our daughter.  She started off on 3 mornings a week from 9:00AM ‚Äì 12:30 AM.  Now nearly 3 yrs old we have increased to 4 mornings as we can‚Äôt keep her away!  She is progressing with leaps and bounds (literally).  She smiles every day, sings all day long and her vocabulary is amazing.

While there is a stairway up to the school, it is really not an issue. Once though the door it opens up into a beautiful warm, CLEAN, colourful friendly environment with lots of wonderful artwork and pictures all over the wall.  All of the toys, books and school equipment is of the highest standard which to me this seemed to lack in some of the other schools we had visited.

You are met every morning by a very friendly face and my daughter can not wait to go in to learn and play with her friends.

The teachers here truly do an EXCELLENT job in making sure all the children are happy and extremely well looked after, without failing to follow up with mummy via text messages if there is any concern at all.  On a weekly basis you are sent updates and photos of how they are getting on which also gives you a nice insight into their morning activities.

Little Gryphons Montessori is true to their mission and I can definitely say we could not be happier with the experience they provide ‚Ä¶

‚ÄúOur goal is to provide a safe, loving and supportive environment for children to grow and learn in. We aim to foster creativity, encourage curiosity and instil within children a behaviour of independent learning and self-confidence in order to have an enduring and positive impact on the child‚Äôs life.‚Äù

Woodlands Secondary School,5,"I am really proud to share that I was a woodlander even today. The school leaders and teachers nurtured students who wanted to strive regardless of their background.

The school provided students with several opportunities to participate in competitions and programmes based on their ability instead of just academic performance in tests and exams.

I learnt several life skills, which are  quintessential in my character development till today by being a Peer Support under Mrs Lim, a Camp instructor under Mr Gary Ong, and leadership and values under Mr Thiru. The school provided several learning and life experiences for students like me, who never would have been able to do so unless I was the cream of the cohort in other top-tier schools. I genuinely believe that the school‚Äôs holistic approach does its utmost in packaging every student with the knowledge and skills as leaders and better citizens as they graduate from the school as a gift to society.

There are many views and models for Early childhood learning. We think that Lumiere has struck the right balance between activity-based learning, contextual learning and life-skill development. It is easy in Singapore for people to be overly focused on preparation towards p1, but then that becomes the destination without enjoying the journey.

The school takes in kids who are on the spectrum ( to a certain degree) and the teachers have the supreme patience and are able to handle and teach my kids some self regulation and self awareness. Their 1 to 1 lessons in the afternoon helped initially with the behavior and subsequently it was to strengthen their academic background.

Thank you to all the teachers, Ernie, Serene, Aileen, Anisa, Sarah and lao shi ( chinese teacher) for all the patience and love shown to the boys. Aidan wants to stay in Lumiere FOREVER ( that's what he said).
Sorry if i had missed out anyone.

The school has multiple bad reviews here as a batch (pair?) of students were caught doing something dirty, however, due to this multiple of my schoolmates get shot dirty-looks as they board public transport even if they display a good attitude.

When all is said and done, the school is great and as the saying goes ‚ÄúNever judge a book by its cover‚Äù, we covered a topic of the school‚Äôs bad reviews the other day and a classmate of mine had told me that people tend to look on the negative sides of the story rather than the positive ones, and trust me, at least eighty percent of the reviews are reporting on the same case",2025-04-23T15:46:46.015Z,Arts

East Spring Secondary School,1,"Went to this school, clerks were LEGIT RUDE  especially the difficult plump angry bossy bespectacled Malay lady with tudong. The Malay lady always picked on me when I did wrong or even times when I was polite and did no wrong, and once insinuated that I lacked manners (Which was not true at all as I was passive and well-liked by all staff and have never offended any staff before) when she‚Äôs the one who ignored me and my mom to chit chat and tend to others after giving us the consent form and even after we have done signing and filling up when my mom came to fetch me as I was ill at the same time my mom was rushing me as she had to go toilet since we have been standing and waiting for 4 minutes just for her acknowledgment after we were done, so I had to help my mom to end it quick and leave, I prompted her ‚ÄúHi, excuse me‚Äù only to be ignored first while she cut short her conversation with the others before turning to tell me in a long whining tone ‚ÄúWhat is it? Done already? That‚Äôs all. Next time wait, don‚Äôt interrupt. Have some manners‚Äù in front of my mom. Hello! How about you be considerate, responsible and reasonable? My mom has an urgency and I was already ill and all you needed to do was to collect the form and dismiss us while chatting, or better you wait for our form first before you chit chat with someone else! And there was once I had to hand in another form from 9am to 5pm, but since I was busy in the morning, I went at 3pm, only to be scolded by her for being so late when I was within the time limit and not even late or last minute. So I don‚Äôt appreciate such treatment. There have been so many bad rowdy unkind students, how about lecturing them? When I kept quiet, also got lectured. Everything also cannot? As a sickly person I dreaded having to go to the general office to be treated like that before getting fetched home. Well done now, I‚Äôm hurt by this on top of all the bullying by my schoolmates because of me being a shy passive teachers‚Äô pet unlike the average teenagers. I hope you get fired from this field, or get back the same treatment by someone.

East Spring Secondary School,1,"This place doesn't even deserve any star here on google review.

I have graduated from here back in 2014. But I think I had enough to say something about this school. I recently came to realization that my current classmate also graduated from this school as well and she withstand the same bs experience here as well (She graduated around 2021.)

At first, I thought it was just me who had a negative experience. But it's not just me.

I endured years and years of hardships in this school. It seriously took a toll on my mental health. Almost anybody who goes in sane and normal also become abnormal. Been bullied... Nobody helped. Been sexually harrased by other classmates, still nobody helped. Teachers also don't give a shit. They cared more about grades than your well-being, with a bit of favourtism at play. The functional daily structure and system in this school was crappy and cheapskate. Everyday, the mantra was about resilience, as part of their school values. Like hello?!?! NOT EVERYTHING NEED TO BE RESILIENT, OKAY? There's this thing called human rights and being treated like a normal human being. Only when I graduated and moved on to poly, then I was referred for counseling.

At first, I thought I must be the only one feeling this way about this school. Turns out it's not just me. Last week, I found out my friend also graduated from here and her experience was hell too.

She is also very experienced and generous with sharing tips about caring for newborns. As we are first-time parents and knew little about handling babies, Aunty Agnes was patient and comprehensive in teaching us how to look after our baby. We learned a lot from her - from bathing, carrying baby in different arm holds to feeding.

She also takes the initiative to make our lives easier - for example, she vacuums our home, places a disposable bag in the toilet for mum to put her used sanitary pads in, records the date of opening the formula milk tin as we don't keep the powder for more than 2 weeks, packs the bag for our polyclinic visits without being reminded to do so, mops the kitchen floor after every cooking.

They gave a generous amount of herbal soup and red date tea which are personalized to mummy (they sent a questionnaire beforehand to find out more about mummy's condition), as well as herbal bath packets. They also gave a complimentary slow cooker pot which was very well used for the whole confinement period. All in all, it was a very fuss-free experience with NannySOS.

Nanny Ah Yiew was a joy to have! She is highly professional and very experienced. The one thing we really love about her is that no matter how fussy the baby is or how tired she is, she's always smiling and positive. If she was ever frustrated or upset, she never showed it. By watching her, it also taught us how to be patient and not frustrated when the baby is crying and screaming. She also picked up the baby's patterns quickly and shared with us possible reasons why baby is upset eg. tired, gassy, hot so that we can quickly and effectively calm the baby.

She was also very knowledgeable in taking care of mummy. Once she knew our food preferences, we had great food every day, three times a day. Sometimes also with dessert. She advised what mummy can eat week by week, and also because our baby had jaundice there were certain foods mummy had to avoid. She kept the kitchen clean and neat, even better condition than it was before she came, haha. She also helped with cleaning around the house and laundry.

If we have a second baby we will definitely look for Ah Yiew again. Thank you NannySOS and Ah Yiew!",2025-07-31T04:55:26.996Z,healthcare

We are thankful to have been allocated Aunty Agnes as our nanny - as first time parents, she has been nothing but affirming, encouraging and meticulous. Re caring for baby, Aunt Agnes is careful and on the ball - she supported us in tracking baby's feeds, provided advice and encouragement to normalise and acknowledge our worries, and is responsive to baby's numerous cues. She was also there for every dr's visit and somehow keeps up a much-needed aura of positivity even when we are all tired. It is also clear that Aunt Agnes loves children - it was reassuring to see her carrying and talking to baby when baby is fussing, and baby clearly calms down with her presence.

Aunt Agnes also took great care of us parents and the household. She prioritises our dietary preferences without compromising on confinement needs, and is super organised with a daily schedule of mealtimes and confinement bath preps. She is also clean and organised in both the prep works and cleaning up. As an experienced nanny with families in Singapore, we were also surprised and thankful that Aunty Agnes is knowledgeable about commonly bought + effective medications, baby items and where to get certain groceries locally. This provided us with a much needed peace of mind and support in this challenging period. When we started learning and taking on more of baby's routines under Aunty Agnes' guidance and supervision in the last 2 weeks, she is also encouraging and supportive and would suggest different methods for us to try out to see which works best for us.

Overall, we had a great period of rest and recovery with Aunty Agnes' care and presence. She does not impose traditional confinement practices (e.g. no hair washing), prioritises our needs and comfort, and takes meticulous care of baby and the household. She has been a wonderful source of support through the sleepless nights and dr's visits, and we feel more confident now to manage baby's care :) Thank you Aunty Agnes and NannySOS!",2025-03-26T03:53:44.752Z,healthcare

NannySOS Confinement Nanny Agency,5,"This is our second time engaging Nanny SOS for their confinement services. We had a different nanny (Lilian) assigned to us this time, but the service was just as great as our experience the very first time. Both nannies that were assigned to us have over a decade of experience and a wealth of experience, giving us the much needed ease of mind.

Lilian was patient, and took a lot of initiative in tasks. She carefully observed what I needed and prepared them ahead of time. For instance, I have a habit of expressing milk from one breast while feeding the newborn on the other. She‚Äôll ensure that the Hakka is ready whenever she brings my baby into the room for feedings. She also checks in regularly on my intake of red date tea and replenishes it timely.

She‚Äôs also flexible, on days that I am unable to cook for my older son she offers to cook a separate portion with less ginger so it‚Äôs toddler-friendly.

In the hours spent with her over conversation during meal times, I find her to be a sincere nanny who truly enjoys taking care of little ones.

Would definitely recommend Nanny SOS, and will be back when I have my third child!",2024-12-16T05:06:42.326Z,Arts

NannySOS Confinement Nanny Agency,5,"This is our second confinement under Nanny Ah You through Nanny SOS. We booked her for two months straight without any hesitation and it was the best decision ever!

Nanny Ah You checked in on my wife from time to time since she became pregnant with our second child earlier this year.

She once again took good care of my wife, enabling good healing and sufficient rest.

She insisted on preparing the herbal bath for my wife even though my wife wanted to skip it due to the cumbersomeness given our limited bathroom space.
She was especially helpful this time also in training our fresh Burmese helper, coaching her in newborn care and also teaching her many Chinese recipes.
Nanny Ah You is genuinely passionate about children - she is gentle and meticulous with caring for our second newborn, and also interacts lovingly with our toddler.

As she is so reliable - we were comfortable leaving her with our newborn to steal some quick couple dates in our second month.
We will miss her support for our household and her sumptuous cooking.

After I recovered, she imparted her skills of how to take care of baby to me. This was a huge relief.

Under her care, I was able to recover very quickly. She empathised with my low morale because of pain after birth- she was not overly strict, taking over the night duty and encouraging me to get more rest.

Most notably, she has a strong passion for cooking, whipping up absolutely delicious and nourishing meals for my family. She even shared her recipes with my family members when they asked! She brought alot of cheerfulness to my household and we will miss her very much.

The Little House (Montessori),5,"TLH is truly a preschool with a difference. We were sad when our son's previous school closed and we had to find a new school for K1. However, it turned out a blessing in disguise because we found TLH. Despite visiting 12 other well-reputed preschools, I'm so glad we chose TLH.

Mrs Katherine, TLH's founder and principal, has a strong vision for the school and how it runs. She is also the most on-the-ground principal I've seen! From being at the gate every morning to welcome the kids, to teaching them, and engaging parents at dismissal/coffee mornings I'm assured her high standards are kept. One thing that struck me when I first walked into the school was how the kids were calm, happy and engaged. I see the philosophy of the school in every aspect of how it is run. Even when I've faced challenging behaviours with my kids, Mrs Katherine has given me advice from her extensive experience and tried-and-tested philosophy.

Mrs Katherine and her teachers also make the effort to know each child individually. During parent teacher meets (and throughout the school year in fact), they share insights that would only come from spending enough time with my child and interacting with him meaningfully.

Many schools claim to develop the child holistically. TLH truly does this and in unique yet effective ways.

My son's previous preschool never brought up his gross motor skills as a concern. At the first parent teacher meet with TLH, they told me it needed working on. I was initially in doubt as I saw him to be adept in the area, especially as we invested time in outdoor play every day after school. However, besides daily outdoor play, TLH also has the most creative races/obstacle courses that train different muscles. A year later, my boy started martial arts outside of school and surprised me and the coaches with his agility. When I asked him why he was so good at the exercises, he said it's like what they do at TLH!

They have weekly cooking sessions where the kids are given the chance to do everything themselves, even when cutting, grating and stir-frying! Since then, my son started having an interest when I bake at home and independently helps me out.

My son was exposed to science experiments in TLH too. On multiple occasions, he was able to explain how something worked when even my older P2 daughter couldn't. Again, he would cite TLH as his source of knowledge üòÑ

I find some preschools charge exorbitantly, and I really don't like how that is amplified during the usual year-end concerts. For TLH, I've always felt their pricing was reasonable, whether in term fees or add-ons. They do not charge extra for their year-end concerts, but instead make it a team effort, where the kids and teachers create the props, costumes and backdrops themselves. That said, if you are the sort of parent who likes perfectly polished concerts likened to watching The Sound of Music on Broadway, this may not be for you. Instead, we look forward every year to performances that allow kids to be kids, and are planned, practiced and performed with much ownership from the kids themselves.

One common misconception about montessori schools is whether kids would be able to transit to mainstream primary. My son who is naturally not the most studious, has had an easy transition into Primary school. In K1, he used to not be able to concentrate on work for longer than 10 minutes. He is now able to concentrate and finish 4-5 pages of homework, and still go on to study for tingxie. He is able to follow the structure of formal schooling yet have the confidence to answer questions when he wants to.

Just in case this is all sounding too good to be true - we as parents get no benefit out of writing good reviews for the school. It is testament to how much we love TLH. Mrs Katherine and her team have been a God-send for our family! Thank you, TLH!",2025-02-13T08:12:44.521Z,Retail

She supervises students and teachers in the school every day. She knows the operation of the school very well and is very strict about everything, which is also part of why I like this kindergarten. She is very experienced. When you don't know how to help your child, just approach her and she will be happy to guide you. Her teaching methods are very effective.

Very impressed with the low turnover rate of the teachers and the love and dedication that the teachers showered on the kids. Out of all my kids, the one who attends TLH is most willing to try to speak Mandarin at home, thanks to the school‚Äôs way of learning.
There is a lot of emphasis on parents and school mutual support which I believe is necessary in educating a child.

The Little House (Montessori),5,"TLH is an outstanding preschool! I highly recommend it.
The principal (Mrs. Katherine) is also the founder and owner of the school. This means that she has final say of how to run the school and sees ideas thru to implementation. It is extremely valuable to have consistent leadership. She anchors and ensures that the school is run up to her high standards and principles, and based on sound research of what is best for children.
The children are taught to be socially aware, responsible and considerate. These and other good habits are inculcated from day one resulting in the school having a calm and cheerful atmosphere. It‚Äôs like a home away from home. The school motto is ‚Äúhelp me help myself‚Äù. There is a focus on confidence and initiative in the context of community. Mrs. Katherine is the model of a skilled and confident person. What better way to teach confidence than to exemplify it authentically! The teachers she selects are of high quality and quite a few have been at the school for many years. This means it‚Äôs a stable environment for the children. My child often tells me how much he loves interacting with his teachers. It is a language-rich environment and I have never heard the teachers speak bad English or Mandarin.
This is a mixed age Montessori school. Older children are paired with younger ones and the kids learn social graces within community, not simply in theory. Older ones learn patience, leadership and kindness towards younger ones. Younger ones experience this and have confidence that one day they can in turn be in that role, rather than all children waiting on adults to serve them. All kids learn that they are active, useful and integral parts of their community thru everyday interactions.
When I went for the school tour a few years ago, I was really caught off guard by 4 children coming up to me to see if I wanted a drink. They were going to pour water for me and host me! It is a true testimony as to how TLH respects children as individuals, believes in their abilities, and empowers them, to the point that the children were not unduly afraid of me, and saw it as their responsibility to host me, the guest in their school. I had visited 10 schools before deciding on this one and even my 1st runner up school is a far cry from what happened during my tour here. The other schools basically told the children to not disturb the adult talking with the principal and go do their own thing. Whereas at TLH, while no one interrupted the conversation, the children were instead encouraged to step up. They are not treated like a distraction to the ‚Äúreal work‚Äù that only adults do, but they are empowered to play key roles in the ‚Äúreal work‚Äù. Imagine the feeling of accomplishment and personal value they feel, and how eager they would be to step up and take initiative again! It shows me how the teachers view the children and their abilities, and natural opportunities that can be seized to build the kids up. To me, these are very well trained and intelligent teachers, and I would be safe to partner with them for my child‚Äôs learning journey.
There is an individualised learning plan for each child. Academic lessons like math and reading are done 1-1. The fast learner does not have to sit in a bored classroom learning what he already knows. The slower learner does not have to feel shame and be discouraged to try their best. The kids abilities are intimately known by teachers because of this 1-1 interaction.
There is cooking every week where the children themselves get to cook! One of life's greatest sensorial  experience. And they learn counting, fractions, mass and volume, chemical reactions, new vocabulary and all that academic stuff without even realizing it.
Montessori schools are meant to be so much more than just Maria Montessori's materials. It is the entire ethos and community life, seeing thru children‚Äôs eyes and respecting them as valuable individuals. TLH is a Montessori par excellence.",2023-04-01T16:12:23.323Z,Hotels

The Little House (Montessori),5,"Our 2.5 year old son loved The Little House! We had a fantastic experience there - Katherine and the teachers were warm, attentive and extremely engaged. It was very clear that the kids welfare was always the #1 priority. We are now based in HK but would definitely pick TLH if we lived there.",2021-06-27T06:44:20.944Z,Retail
The Little House (Montessori),5,"This was the first kindergarten I viewed after we moved to sunset area. I stepped in an old fashion glass door and got a warm welcome from Mrs Katherine. She enthusiastically walked me around while introducing how the classes would be carried out etc. We walked to the outdoor area, kids were happily playing in the small garden. There came a little girl, she saw me and came close to me. Before I realised, she poured me a glass of water from their snack station, where I saw a tray with couple of glasses stacking up, a jar of water and bananas neatly laying on top of it. That was it. I cancelled all appointments with other kindergarten and enrolled my boy.

My boy was then 4yr8month, he enjoyed going to TLH so much. Every week he told me a new science experiment; a new country with either its language or food; a new role-play with manner; oh yeah, a new goodie he made under the instruction of teachers. I was very impressed. The teachers made it all seemed so effortless, yet meaningful.

I remembered those days, parents gathered outside of the glass door where the kids lined up and got checked before going in school. Teachers welcomed kids with the brightest smile and funny talks. Mrs Katherine stood at her most comfy tree pose and chatted with us, we all started our days with lots of joy and laughter. Of course, most importantly, we knew our kids would have a wonderful school day at TLH.

How can I not mention the year end concert? It was fascinating. Nothing fancy but full of love and warmth. Teachers and kids designed their own stage, no one needed to wear special clothes or make-up. Kids chose what they most comfortable with and what they want to perform. They gave it their best on the stage. It was a pure joy for parents to see the how much their confidence have grown over a year. 2020, the pandemic hit. Teachers in TLH managed to gather all students single performing clips and created a long video. It was heartfelt. Still it seemed so effortless but meaningful.

We strongly recommend The Little House Montessori. It was the best decision to enrol our boy there. Everyday in his primary school life has benefitted greatly from his experience at TLH. Thank you all the lovely teachers in TLH.",2021-06-14T04:29:34.324Z,healthcare

The Little House (Montessori),5,"When we moved to Singapore three years ago, we visited about 15 preschools before we chose the Little House Montessori for our eldest child. We are absolutely thrilled with our choice, and this year, our younger child also started at TLHM.

Each child has an individualised education plan, and the teachers are very tuned in to the needs and progress of every child. With their decades of combined experience, they provide a lot of support and advice around any developmental and behavioural issues that your child may face. Our children love the geography lessons, the science experiments, the weekly cooking, the play-based learning, and the structure they get at school. As parents, we love the wholesome (bilingual) environment, the wonderfully diverse student group, the excellent team of teachers and staff, and the inclusive community, all ably held together and led by the head directress, Mrs. Katherine. I especially appreciate the emphasis on good manners, the practical lessons in independence, the focus on the children‚Äôs physical development, and the language support given for non-native Mandarin speakers. This is an incredible place for children to spend their early formative years, and I highly recommend the Little House Montessori to anyone who wants to inculcate confidence and a love of learning in their child.",2020-08-17T02:57:40.493Z,Arts

SL Education Centre,5,"Throughout our time with Susan, we witnessed her passion for teaching and also her desire to really help students excel - not just in their studies but in life as well. Even though she has been in the industry for 20 years, and can hire more teachers so that she can be more hands off, she still opted for a hands on approach to teaching and interact with the kids as if they are her own by choosing to teach herself.

In her lessons, I can tell that she genuinely cares about the students' well being that goes beyond dollar and sense. The students love interacting with her and looks forward to her lessons as she takes the effort to build strong relationship with the students.

For weaker students, she also takes the time and effort to encourage them, while spurring the classmates to do the same also.

Every year, no matter how busy she gets, she makes the effort to know the incoming orientation class as well, so that she knows everyone by name. We are privileged and thankful to have worked with someone like Susan over her tuition centre journey.",2022-09-03T05:09:08.999Z,food and beverages

At our request, she keeps a log of activities for the day so that we are not left out of the loop.

MBC prestige location has grade A security and even has periodic police task force patrolling to ensure the deveopment's safety. there are banks and government agencies occupying the devlopment spaces and hence, the champs can be guaranteed world class safety.

Agora Colearning,5,"I have done the rounds of pre schools in Singapore over the past 7 years. I have looked for a preschool that actively cares and listens to the child, never leaves a crying child assuming they‚Äôll ‚Äôjust be ok‚Äô and a preschool where smiling teachers wholeheartedly nurture the children. Agora is the place! From the first day to the last, the team do everything they can to help the child settle, feel comfortable, develop relationships with all staff as well as other children and their parents. A special mention to Ms Eka, Ms Bell and Ms Pari who have done everything they can for my son - and for me too! Their warmth, consistency, effort, sense of humour and care has been the best model my son could have seen a pre school to be. Sometimes evidence of this is hard to prove in preschools, but I have seen first hand over a year how effective the whole team are at making children feel welcomed, safe and essentially HAPPY. I have learned so much myself from them even though I used to teach myself - it really is colearning! There really isn‚Äôt anything like Agora in Singapore - it suits everyone from locals to expats and everyone is treated exactly how they should be - it‚Äôs a beautiful hearty place to start your education journey with your child and I can‚Äôt recommend enough. Thank you Agora and to the special teachers - you have made me look at my son differently, made me slow down my parenting and given my son space to be whoever he wants to be. He‚Äôs only had positive experiences at the centre and that alone is amazing. Even the children are all wonderful - I‚Äôve seen so many progress right in front of me and it‚Äôs purely because of the teachers. And to Ms Claire who runs the centre - you are as I‚Äôve told you, an ANGEL! You shine bright and take everyone with you - how magical. I will not be having a third child, but if I ever did, they will be going here!",2025-08-12T15:22:20.301Z,Arts

This morning, the teachers and management team at Agora brought all the Play Group students to the beach. Despite the very young age of the children‚Äîsome as young as 18 months‚Äîthe teachers took wonderful care of them throughout the outing.
Their dedication, commitment, and tender love were clearly shown. The children had a great time by the sea, playing with sand and enjoying the fresh air. Although it rained earlier, the children stayed dry thanks to the team‚Äôs thoughtful planning and alternative arrangements.
It was heartwarming to see the children and teachers so happy, though a little tired by the end. These outings always create special bonding moments between teachers, parents, and children.

Agora Colearning,5,"As a parent of a neurodivergent child, finding the right preschool felt like an uphill battle. My son, who has sensory and learning challenges, struggled to adapt in previous schools that simply weren‚Äôt equipped to support his unique needs. After multiple attempts, we finally found Agora, and it has been nothing short of transformative.

From day one, his teachers have provided not just instruction but deep, intentional care. They have taken the time to truly understand his emotional and learning needs, tailoring their approach to ensure he feels safe, valued, and capable. Their patience, creativity, and commitment have helped him make progress we once thought impossible. He is now more engaged, more confident, and most importantly, happy to go to school each day.

At the heart of Agora‚Äôs philosophy is its incredible head of Early Years director, Miss Claire. She doesn‚Äôt just manage the program‚Äîshe listens. She understands that every child is different and ensures that each one is nurtured in a way that respects their individual journey. Her leadership fosters an environment where children are not just accommodated but genuinely celebrated for who they are.

Agora is more than a preschool; it is a community that embraces diversity with warmth and sincerity. If you are a parent searching for a place where your child will be seen, heard, and supported, I cannot recommend Agora enough. I encourage you to visit, meet the wonderful educators, and see firsthand the love and dedication that make this school so special.",2025-02-07T13:03:47.271Z,healthcare

Agora Colearning,5,"I recently booked the event spaces at Agora Colearning for my daughter's 2nd birthday. It was a great experience overall from start to end.

1. The events manager Aishah was very prompt and helpful from the moment I reached out to her. She was able to answer my questions and provided advice/suggestions to make the event a more meaningful one for my daughter and guests. It made the whole planning for the event a fuss-free and pleasant experience.

2. The playspace that I rented was very spacious and clean. It came with 3 playing areas for the kids - mini playground, baby gym and kitchen play area. These areas kept all the kids entertained for the duration of the party.

3. There was still plenty of space left for tables and chairs to be set up for guests to sit and dine. Overall, the whole area wasn't cramped and was good for our party size of 30+ guests (both kids and adults).

4. One advantage of working with Agora was their tie ups with their vendors. I did not have to go through the trouble of finding my own vendors. Through the recommendation of Aishah, I engaged a balloon sculptor, bouncy castle and a face painter. Both vendors were not only prompt to come early but were excellent in their services. The kids had so much fun face painting and getting animal balloons.

5. Accessibility was easy even though it was located at Harbourfront Centre. Plenty of parking spaces within the building.

All in all, I would highly recommend working with Agora and renting their spaces for kid's birthday parties.

Would love to show photos of the venues but all the photos have images of my child and the kids of the guests. Apologies due to privacy issues.",2024-08-07T00:51:52.866Z,Retail

Throughout the process, the A-Team staff assigned to us was responsive and attentive. Each time I called or texted a question to A-Team's staff, it would be answered quickly. They also took the time and effort to carefully screen babysitter options in line with our childcare requirements and household needs. A-Team's one-time agency fee also means that they do not take a cut of the babysitter's monthly/weekly pay. We really appreciate this ethical and fair policy taken by A-Team towards their babysitters. Their professional help and expert services makes every cent of the agency fee worth it. As a result of this one-time agency fee, you are also able to build a personal relationship with your babysitter.

The school premises are new, clean and thoughtfully designed with appropriate spaces for learning, play and enrichment. I love that children are encouraged to indulge in creative play in the charming pretend play areas.

The inclusion of diverse masterclasses is a masterstroke in enhancing learning experiences for kids - this is a unique feature of LWPS's curriculum. The outdoor play opportunities are great too.

Overall our son has immensely enjoyed his journey with LWPS so far. We would highly recommend this school to parents who are looking for a vibrant and caring environment and a holistic learning experience for their children.",2025-04-01T08:14:58.805Z,Retail
Lorna Whiston Preschool (Hort Park),5,"My 3yo daughter was enrolled into LW before they moved to current Hort Park location, so I was lucky to experience the school in both environments. I remember back in the black and white house, every time I passed by the school playground around 5pm, I saw not only the kids having fun, but all teachers there with the kids, running, chasing each other, laughing, and very engaged. I could see the teachers truly enjoyed being with the kids and love what they do.

My daughter was shy and resistant of going to school before LW. We thought it was just her personality. However since she got into LW, she's been super excited to go to school every day, and whenever I asked her, she would say she ""Love the school and the teachers"".

The school also has a lot more fun filled classes throughout the day, a lot more than usual preschools. They have dedicated teachers for each of sports, music, art, speech and drama subjects, and dedicated space for each subject. My daughter always had so much fun in school that I didn't mind keeping her there for the full day till 5:30pm. She probably wouldn't have had equal amount of fun and engaging activities in a social setting if she comes home earlier.

Still, on top of all the amazing resources and hardware, what's important to us as parents, in the end, is the team working in the school. Despite the fact that they lost their own outdoor space, the teachers mostly remained the same, and most teachers have been there for many years. Tbe fact that they cared so much about the kids and loved their work, made me decide to stay with the school after the move.

I believe hardware is easy to get. But consistently loving teachers as a team, that the kids are looking forward to seeing everyday, is hard to get by. I would strongly recommend this school to anyone who cares about the above factors as much as we do.",2025-03-29T15:38:51.226Z,Food & Beverage

Given LW‚Äôs background they are naturally strong in English but I feel that their Chinese curriculum is truly amazing and most of their Chinese Teachers (Native Chinese) are fairly long tenured & experienced. My 9 year old boy started at LW PG at 1.5 yrs, and most of the Chinese teachers then are still around. My 6 year K2 girl is graduating this year and she is able to read many Chinese books by herself which I was personally quite impressed by. She was even able to read most of the common words Á±≥Â∞èÂúà which completely surprised me. We have not sent our kids to any Chinese enrichment programmes while they were at LW and my boy has been able to cope well after in Primary school. I really attribute that to the strong bilingual environment and strong academic foundation that LW has given my children.

Books are readily available in the classrooms and there are reading programmes. Children also get to bring home 2-4 books every week to read. LW has also done a great job inculcating a love of reading in my children.

Aside from academics, I think their biggest strength is that they have a good balance between play and learning. The children also have a lot of time to play and express their creativity.

First and foremost, we want to give a heartfelt shoutout to the amazing teachers, Fitriah and Lorraine. Their commitment to the children's emotional well-being is evident in everything they do. They create a nurturing and supportive environment where each child feels valued and understood. Our daughter has thrived under their care, growing in confidence and joy every day.

One of the highlights for us as parents is the detailed weekly updates provided by the teachers. These updates are incredibly thorough, offering a clear picture of the week's activities and our child's progress. They have become invaluable talking points at home, allowing us to engage with our daughter about her experiences and reinforce her learning. It's clear that Fitriah and Lorraine put a lot of effort into these updates, and we deeply appreciate it.

The energy and warmth of the head of the centre, Selena, is also worth mentioning. Her welcoming nature sets a positive tone for the entire preschool. She is always approachable and ensures that both children and parents feel comfortable and supported. Selena's leadership is evident in the cohesive and vibrant atmosphere of the centre.

In summary, Julia Gabriel Preschool at Keppel Bay is a wonderful place for early childhood education.

The campus location is great and safe (at the marina thus minimal traffic and super simple pick up/drop offs), superb natural light in the school (instead of those fluorescent lit dingy hole in the wall schools/classrooms), big outdoor play area, stunning views and extremely attentive staff.

Coming from MindChamps, I was honestly not expecting a huge change given that my son already liked school. But ever since we started at JG, he has been begging to get to school early for breakfast (he is not a morning person at all but wakes up without a fuss) and sometimes even requests to return to school after school ends.

He has become more outspoken, confident and happier overall. Biggest plus being that he is exhausted and knocks out early every night.

We have been through several schools but nothing compares to JG. Can‚Äôt wait for my younger son to join his brother there.

More importantly, the values of integrity and compassion are well embeded into the teacher-staff-student daily learning and communication. We appreciate ICS for giving my child the opportunity to choose and grow in his areas of interest. In his Senior thesis, he was allowed to choose a topic of interest, that is, increasing the social virality of his Youtube channel. In the course of this, he was able to develop his research and communications skills. Second, ICS has sufficient module offerings to allow my child to grow his giftings. For example, being part of the School Yearbook team, he was able to hone his photography and editing skills. As a result, he was able to intern, upon graduation, at a photo studio. This has led to an opportunity to help out in documenting and producing 20 individualised photobooks for persons living with dementia and the Senior Centre's staff and volunteers.

Felt she was hardworking and caring though, and perhaps could make a good Mandarin teacher.  But, learnt later that inappropriate remarks were made to the children, that could terrify or scare them (about throwing them out, etc)..
Seriously inadequate carpark facilities, esp after merger with GreatWorld branch. Imagine total of more than 100 children, in a facility with only 8 outdoor lots (no shelter), out of which, 6 lots are located dangerously close to the canal, and laden with uneven or broken concrete slabs and stones all around (my child fell at a lot and got injured once).
Despite numerous reminders not to throw anything, they still lost some of my child's work and craft done at school (6 out of 8 items I tried to get, were lost, guess thrown away) :(
Overall, not worth the high fees, as even the government or government-related centres had teachers who spoke and taught better Eng, and who displayed more sincerity.  Here, no viable action was done to rectify the issue of the lack of Eng standards in a kindergarten level teacher who taught Eng and Math, and not a single word of apology was given to address the fact that changing school in the middle of the final yr of kindergarten posed so much hassle to us.",2020-06-09T06:37:39.650Z,Food & Beverage

I must say that you have to take charge of your own learning and go up to him with questions. Don't wait silently without understanding anything, which is what I was like in the first half of my lessons with him. He was willing to stay back with me when I had questions and encouraged me alot

I was a F9 student throughout sec 3. Got D7 for my prelims. For my Olevels I got an A2. I must say Mr Eio is not some kind of a magician to help you instantly change your grades. You have to put in the hard work yourself. But he certainly was a very big help and helped me to achieve my results. His encouragement meant so much each night and it gave me the motivation and drive to make him and myself proud. He helped me understand the concepts better for every question I asked

Mr Eio is very passionate about Mathematics, and constantly encourages his students to work hard and tackle & approach the problems in the simplest way possible.
I have been consistently scoring A grades for math, A for PSLE, A1 and A2 in O levels for EMath and AMath respectively and soon I believe, A for A levels too. If you‚Äôre looking for an experienced tutor to help your children score their As for Mathematics, I highly encourage you to enroll them in Mr Eio‚Äôs class!",2024-01-02T14:00:22.584Z,food and beverages
"Simon Eio Learning Centre - Primary, Secondary and JC Math & Science Tuition @ Clementi",5,"The centre as well as its teachers have accompanied me throughout my secondary school years. Their close guidance and teaching methods are one of the main reasons why I am able to understand and grasp concepts much quicker than my peers in school which facilitates a deeper understanding of the topic and subject as a whole. The teachers are very open and dedicated to helping my classmates and I whenever and wherever we may have had problems with our work, making the learning process much smoother and less frustrating than it would have been without them. It is thanks to them that I am confident in scoring well in my O levels.

Mr Eio has each lesson curated by him to provide the fastest path to understanding the topic in both E math and A math, distilling the learning points of the topic at hand through his years of experience teaching and allowing us to learn it deeply before tackling harder questions. It allows students like myself to have a good perspective on what the topic actually is without getting scared by the more difficult problems that the topic may have to offer, allowing me to score more marks during the exam as I am able to rely on the few important question processing steps that he has emphasised during lessons.

Mr Lim makes learning easier by giving many real life examples and applications of the sciences that we are learning in class, making information stick and making it easier for me to retrieve information during exams. He plans his lessons meticulously and has a plan for each stage of learning that we are in, whether it be in studying or revision. He goes the extra mile by sorting through years and years of past year papers from other schools and picking out the most interesting ones so that we are better equipped to answer whatever questions come out for the exams; which can be quite erratic as is the nature of the science exams, which is why his extensive combing is much appreciated

It has been a joy to be the student of the amazing teachers here and their continuous help throughout the years truly allowed me to perform my utmost best during the exams. I cannot recommend this place enough.",2023-12-31T08:17:19.983Z,Hotels

The academic foundation our children have built at Masterminds Namly is truly remarkable. The school's approach to preparing students for future educational success goes far beyond traditional kindergarten curriculum. Their bilingual program has given our children fluency in both English and Chinese, providing them with invaluable language skills that will open doors throughout their academic careers and beyond.

What sets this school apart is how seamlessly they blend rigorous academic preparation with the caring, loving environment that makes learning joyful. The teachers are not just dedicated educators‚Äîthey are visionary professionals who understand how to build critical thinking skills, foster independence, and instill a genuine love of learning that will serve our children for life.

The multicultural environment enriches their academic experience immensely, exposing them to diverse perspectives and ways of thinking that broaden their intellectual horizons. Our children's confidence has grown exponentially, not just socially but academically‚Äîthey approach new challenges with enthusiasm and the tools to succeed.

Masterminds brilliantly prepares children for future academic success by developing self-direction, problem-solving abilities, and intrinsic motivation. Our children have learned to think independently, manage their time effectively, and take ownership of their learning‚Äîskills that will be invaluable as they progress through their educational journey.

The thoughtfully designed quaterly field activities reinforce classroom learning while developing real-world application skills. These experiences teach our children to connect academic concepts to the world around them, fostering the kind of critical thinking that top schools look for.

Under the leadership of their incredibly principal, Carol, the school maintains academic excellence while nurturing the whole child. The curriculum is rigorous yet age-appropriate, challenging our children to reach their full potential while building the strong academic foundation they need for future success.

From a non schooler, I thank the teachers at Brighton for educating my kid to adapt primary school easily.

Like every other kinder school, each have their own problems to solve (I.e staffing). At Brighton, staffing has always promptly taken and no impact to anyone. But no fret, their environment and curriculum are well designed to comfort, kid friendly as well as education.

The kids are induce with knowledge ready for primary school but also playing is part of their learning. Many additional enrichment provided like sports, dancing and robotics.

Nurtured Nest,5,"Nurtured Nest holds a very special place in our hearts. My daughter spent nearly three years there, and those years laid a truly beautiful foundation for her‚Äîsocially, emotionally, and intellectually. She made friends for life and experienced a nurturing environment that continues to shape her even after our move to Canada.

What impressed me most was how seamlessly the teachers at Nurtured Nest instilled a sense of discipline and individuality from such a young age. For young girls in particular, it‚Äôs so important to learn that their voices matter and their opinions are valued‚Äîand this was deeply embedded in the school's ethos. Remarkably, the confidence and curiosity my daughter developed at Nurtured Nest helped her transition smoothly to her new school, where she continues to thrive.

Beyond the children‚Äôs growth, the school embodies the multicultural spirit of Singapore. Every festival‚Äîwhether Chinese New Year, Hari Raya, or Diwali‚Äîis celebrated with equal joy and inclusiveness. As parents, we were welcomed as part of a larger extended family, and I still fondly remember looking forward to each of these celebrations.

Choosing Nurtured Nest was one of the best decisions we made for our daughter. I would be more than happy to connect with any prospective parent who would like to hear more about our experience.",2025-06-30T17:00:10.947Z,retail

Nurtured Nest,5,"Our two young boys attended Nurtured Nest from around 17‚Äì18 months old and spent several wonderful years there. We initially chose NN because of its focus on outdoor play, child independence, and its warm, community feel‚Äîand it delivered on all fronts.

One of the selling points for us for us was the small class sizes. Our boys were in groups of just 6‚Äì12 children, not in a room of 30. This made a huge difference in the level of care and attention they received. Every morning began with outdoor play‚Äîrain or shine. On rainy days, the kids were bundled up in raincoats and boots, and we absolutely loved this commitment to outdoor time and resilience.

The small size of the school means the staff can really tailor care to each child. Toilet training, for example, was handled with patience and support. All staff knew the children and families well, which created a strong sense of connection and made for a gentle, nurturing transition into school life.

Healthy, varied meals are provided, and the children are introduced to cooking activities from as young as 18 months, which they loved. Forest school is also introduced to the kids around 4.

As a relatively new school, Nurtured Nest had a few teething issues in its early years‚Äîmainly around communication and some staff turnover‚Äîbut to their credit, these were acknowledged and addressed. So please read old reviews with compassion, building a school is no easy feat! The team clearly puts a lot of thought into ensuring staff align with the school‚Äôs ethos, which takes time and required hard choices but pays off.

The team of teachers are passionate for the children‚Äôs learning, social emotional well-being, and most importantly‚Äî FUN! The activities organised for the children are catered to their interests and needs, and are very much authentic learning experiences which engage the children‚Äôs 5 senses, and gives them plenty of opportunities to play and work with one another in the great outdoors. It is not your typical preschool where children are forced to sit down and listen to a static, academic lesson from a whiteboard, but instead a play-based school where they are fully immersed and engaged in their learning. Children spend lots of time getting messy and dirty in the sand and rain (with raincoats and boots of course!), creating masterful artworks with paint and loose parts and glue, or simply just having a picnic in the grass patch behind the school. This is not just a great school for young children, but for any potential practicum students who are looking for a unique, vibrant, and out-of-the-norm preschool as an attachment centre.

We value outdoor time for our child and NN provides lots of this during the day, sometimes even when it rains (the children are required to have raincoats and boots). We also resonate with the Reggio Emilia approach which the school follows.

My First Skool at Blk 260 Bukit Batok,5,"This childcare centre by MFS is a hidden gem. My elder boy entered the centre halfway in K1 (in 2019) and the teachers (Luo Laoshi & Teacher Ram) did a great job to assimilate him and encouraged the other children to engage him. For a boy who cried daily at drop off in his previous school, we were prepared that he'll cry again, but to our surprise, he didn't cry at all during this transition and thereafter, enjoyed going to sch daily until he graduated last year.

My younger child now has the same privilege to be cared for by the same team of dedicated teachers (Luo Laoshi, Teacher Ram & Teacher Kavitha).

Curriculum wise, I had my concerns initially like most parents - shd I pay more for better academic focus? That's always the scale that most parents would weigh, but my concerns were allayed as I've come to realize that MFS is a good balance of both affordability and quality. My elder boy enjoyed learning through the various inquiry projects - there would be different themes each term and the teachers put in a lot of effort to pique children's curiosity via hands-on activity, parent engagement,  relation to current affairs and relevance to primary school. The teachers also took many pictures of my child in action and I can easily view the pictures weekly in the parents portal to see what they've learned in school. My boy excelled under this system and is now doing well in primary school with strong foundation set during the 2 yrs of his time in MFS.

Apart from its team of caring and competent teachers, the centre's layout is also a plus point. The classes are split into 3 different bays around blk 258/260, so cases of hfmd, and even covid were kept to a minimal.

Many parents who sent their children to this centre also echo my same view and thus I'd not hesitate to recommend this centre to my family, neighbours and friends.",2022-04-29T00:40:14.571Z,retail

Arts Junior Montessori Preschool,5,"Hi
I'm writing this testimonial with lots of love and gratitude for all the support and great services that the Art Junior Montessori had provided for my daughter.Siti Aisyah had an impressive progress in her tenure at Arts Junior Montessori, both her teachers and Principal were very patient and never had failed to keep encourage Siti Aisyah to improve her motor skills and communication.

My Daughter, Siti Aisyah was delayed in her speech and her motorskills .Since that first interview with Ms Shana in which she provided Siti Aisyah the opportunity to enroll in Arts Junior Montessori,  little by little she has been able to control herself by crawling and learning to walk/stand . This was all possible due to the staff dedication and strong work ethics commitment .

Both myself and my husband really appreciate all the effort, hard work, love and care that every carer has ever shown towards her. Enrolling my daughter into Arts Junior Montessori was one of the best things we‚Äôve done as a family.

I would highly recommend to anyone looking for child care in this area. ü§ó",2021-06-04T10:49:54.175Z,Hotels

Arts Junior Montessori Preschool,1,"Own management review their own school. The 2 five stars ratings are from their management.

Arts Junior Montessori Preschool,1,"I would like to recount my experience at the school and for all parents to be informed. My child was severely injured with a bone displacement and fracture and was not given first-aid. The school also did not inform me of the injury and she was crying for at least 45 minutes till I arrived to pick her. She was clutching her injured arm, sitting beside two teachers who were nonchalantly cutting paper and not paying any attention to her. She was later admitted to A&E and was there for 9 hours.

We then found out that they had hired an illegal worker who was supervising the children. Unfortunately, the School avoided all responsibility and refused to meet with us nor the parents of the two boys who caused the injury. The School's owner (Ms Momoyo Misugi) also prevented one of the boy's mother from apologizing to us as she said that my father threatened to beat the boys. When we confronted her on this matter, she panicked (wondering how we got to know about it) and brushed it away saying that she may have misheard my father.

With regards to the illegal employment, the School maintained that the person was an 'observer' and was not paid. Other parents and I saw the person for more than 3 weeks and actively working with the kids. Not just observing. The School then told ECDA that the person was there for only less than a week.

For close to 9 months, Ms Misugi refused to meet us till she finally relented to pressure from ECDA (government). Even to fix a date for the meeting, she kept saying she was not free or was overseas. On a day that she was supposed to be away, she was caught red-handed by ECDA to be in the School.

With the influx of students since Jan 2017, there's been much overcrowding, poor control and hygiene especially at the toilets. The teachers look irritated and harassed especially with the younger children crying non-stop and their diapers falling off because the teachers are just overwhelmed with the number of kids.

They also sent us reminders of late payment on school fees during the months that my daughter was recovering from her fractured and displaced arm. We found that to be in such poor taste. We also had a hard time enrolling her in a new school as they did not release her name from the childcare link system. The School also refused to return us our deposit.

I also heard from another parent about her son being bitten by mosquitoes/bugs so badly he came home with 12 very swollen and lumpy bites all over his legs and body. The parents asked the school and they simply replied that there were no other cases so the boy must have gotten it from elsewhere. The parent was very upset with the dismissive attitude. She pulled her child out.

In my 1+ year enrolling my child in the school, more than 4 local principals/administrators came and left. There was also high turnover of admin staff. I thought something was very wrong when teachers also started to leave all of a sudden. I know of at least 2 teaches who went on leave and never came back.

Back in 2016/17, the school did not take temperature and check for HFMD. I am not sure if that is allowed. We highlighted this to them several times and they made some attempt of getting parents to record the temperature before coming to school. I believe this is not in line with ECDA's requirement.

Hope to bring awareness to other parents out there.",2018-05-31T02:07:58.112Z,Hotels
Arts Junior Montessori Preschool,1,"In 2017, our 2 years old daughter started to go to Arts Junior Montessori. On 3rd day, when mother picked up our daughter, she was crying badly. Mother thouht it was just because our daughter didn't like the school so she left the school quickly. On their way home, mother found 3 injuries in arm (bleeding), knee and inside mouth (bleeding). We complained over phone but the school didn't admit nor apologize. On the contrary, they suspected she was injured after school and asked us the possibility of injury after school repeatedly even after we explained the possibility of 3 injuries without our perception was nil.

I was surprised and frightened with the fact that,
1.The school was totally unaware of 3 injuries. It's not easy to overlook 3 times injury ??
2. They didn't consider the possibility of injury at school even though they overlooked 3 injuries (paid less attention to children ??)

Unfortunately, our daughter was 2 years old and couldn't explain what happened at school. But she was really scared of the school so we withdrew our daughter next day. I heard at least 2 more incident at this school & those are posted to some website.",2018-05-29T16:26:09.934Z,food and beverages

We are Japanese and my son couldn't speak English or Chinese, but Ms Janice and the other teachers helped him get used to the school.
It has been five months since my son started kindergarten, and I am really glad that I chose Cheston. He quickly adapted to school life and seems to have grown so much. In addition to the daily activities, there are field trips, various events, and recently a school camp where my son stayed overnight away from home with his friends and teachers for the first time, and he came back feeling very confident.

It was a big decision for us to send our child to a local preschool in a foreign country, but now I feel that it was the right decision to send my son to Cheston Montessori Preschool.

We sent our first son to Cheston Montessori in Dec 2020, when he was 4 months old. Being new parents, we were initially apprehensive about sending him to infant care, and did not know what to expect. Our apprehensions, however, were soon dispelled. The staff were warm and friendly, patient with our queries, and accommodating about our requests. They provided us timely updates about the care and feeding of our son, were always willing to share about his day when we picked him up, and generous with advice without being prescriptive or intrusive.

All this would have been ample reason for us to give a 5 starred review. But Cheston and its staff went beyond this. They had an engaging programme for our son, teaching him many things and developing his growing mind through creative and age-appropriate activities. The staff made it a point to get to know our son as an individual, and share specific insights which helped us to get to know him better too.

We have now sent our second son (4 months old) to Cheston, and are so glad to have their support and care again.

ACS International,5,"I wanted a different experience for my older girl after PSLE and attended the open houses of all the local intl schools. We chose ACS Intl due to a few factors, proximity, Alma Mater of husband and from the general feel of the school. We noticed during the open house that the kids were allowed to present and run some parts of it independently. This was a good sign - didn‚Äôt matter if it wasn‚Äôt 100% perfection as kids would learn how to talk to adults and present themselves. We took the plunge and she was our guinea pig. She completed four happy years there and went on school trips where she learnt how to look after herself away from home. Prepared her well to study overseas. Teachers are kind and able to provide actual detailed feedback. As an example, I was told she could benefit from cooking more at home to help with her Chemistry practical skills which was very true. After that her sibling also joined the school and am happy to say the experience is consistent. If you want happy well adjusted kids I can recommend this school. I must add that bullying is not tolerated and the school is quick to address behavioral issues. In terms of academics your child should have no issues if they do their work consistently as tests are based on what they teach at school and the school has a good balance between work and play. For CCAs lots of options and chances to try new things. I have met random parents from the school over the years and most have used the word ‚Äúthrive‚Äù to describe their child‚Äôs experience. Overall the intangible things I have noticed in both kids are an increase in confidence, they are not scared to sign up for new things and willing to take the risk of failure after one or two years here,  best is yet to be!",2024-03-27T07:36:18.849Z,healthcare

The parent community is very strong not just within the class but across year 1 parent community. Parents are given lots of opportunities to support school activities and it makes it a nurturing environment.  Finally, the school leadership has made a lot of efforts to update and engage parents eg parent tutor night, meet the principal sessions which is great.

They are always updating me about my son during send off and pick up, updates in the communication book, child's portfolio, parents portal and meet the parents sessions are some of the useful communication channels  that I find useful to get insights in his progress in school.

The teachers supported, encouraged and helped in other aspects such as doing daily routines independently, eating their fruits and veges and even potty training. The teachers, at every level built great relationships with him. This makes him feel safe in school and in turn, enjoys going to school.
The centre teachers take a lot of time and effort to make the classroom a conducive and playful atmosphere for the children based on the the different learning themes throughout the year. This sets an engaging atmosphere for them to play and learn. My son always talks about the different themes at the Dramatic Corner and Learning Centres that the teachers prepared. The centre encourage learning and bonding time at home with the take home activities that are based on the learning themes. The classrooms are clean and neat.  Baskets with learning tools and toys are organised neatly in shelves so that the children can easily pick them based on their interest.

Brighton Montessori Sunset,5,"My daughter has multiple, severe food allergies, so keeping her safe was our utmost priority when selecting her preschool. The teachers at Brighton Montessori at Sunset Way have been so caring and helpful, and have kept her safe from the very beginning, for which we are immensely grateful. They would give us a heads up on any food-based activities, and would also try to source safe alternatives for her if possible. Special shout out to Ms. Sharmaine, Ms. Cindy and Wang Lao Shi for always being so thoughtful towards her allergies! They've even set up a snack basket for her for birthday celebrations; Wang Laoshi even went to the extent of specially preparing a safe MSW durian filling just so my girl could partake in the mooncake making activity!

We also really love the weekly outdoor runs the kids go on, along the nature canal where they can spot monitor lizards and otters!

Curriculum-wise, Brighton has a dedicated approach for English and Math, catered to each child's learning pace. Both my girls picked up reading very quickly under Ms. Sharmaine's guidance. That said, the school is known to be quite academically-focused especially from K1 onwards - they prepare the child well for primary school but it also comes with quite a bit of homework every week!

Both my children enjoyed their time at this school, and we have been blessed with lovely teachers we can trust!",2025-04-17T01:18:03.640Z,Food & Beverage

Only has one bus route to get there the fastest, so 189 bus is your only way to get to school normally. The bust stop outside school is absolute c- crowded. Chill school without much happening around you, those types where days can fly by with nothing happening. Relationships are only between male and female students with their homework and textbooks.

Nan Hua High School,1,"Dear Principal on Nan Hua High School

I am writing to inform you of a disturbing behavior I have observed from students of Nan Hua High School. Many Nan Hua students were very loud on the bus which my peers and I found very disruptive.

The Nan Hua students have also crowded around the bus stop and block the pathway outside the bus stop making it very hard to navigate without going off the path and onto the grass patch. As a small comparison conversations between the NUS high students cannot be heard.

This is not the first incident of Nan Hua students being loud in public and this behavior has been observed for months without noticeable change or effort to stop.

I would like to request that the teachers of your institution kindly advice students to try to be less loud and be more socially aware of their behavior and conduct when in public especially on public transport or public spaces during peak hours where there are members of the public rushing to get to their destination and it is already very difficult without the Nan Hua students obstructing the pathways.

Alpha Green Preschool Bukit Timah,5,"This is a lovely preschool surrounded by nature. They have a nice garden and outdoor space , mainly shaded ( differently from other schools I have seen)
They are committed to spend at least 3 hrs outside and they have recently invited parents for outdoor learning with the kids. My 3 yo son deeply loves the water play once a week and the gardening class .
They also have ballet and music classes which have helped him to be more aware of his body and movements, following the rhythm.

It s a small school, in my perspective much more caring than a big one ( where we went before ) , sometimes might feel less structured and organised than a big one, sometimes it s penalized by the proximity with GESS , but the owner is really putting her heart on it ( as well as her kids - which says it all) and our son is very happy there.",2023-06-22T04:21:43.152Z,Arts

The combination of Russian, English and Chinese languages is quite rare and we are so happy we managed to find it! Our son now is 5.5 years old and he has graduated from Alpha Green recently. We are sad that we have to find another solution to keep all three languages flowing as the school has done it perfectly!
The good care for children coupled with creative and holistic approach to education makes the school standing out.

MindChamps PreSchool @ JTC Summit,5,"Our journey into MindChamps begin when Dexter was 18 months old. At
that point of time, we were looking to place him at a pre-school where
we will feel assured that he will be well taken care of, whilst both of us
were at work. Although that seems like a minuscule requirement of ours,
we were apprehensive after visiting several schools in the vicinity. As we
had nephews who were previously enrolled in MindChamps, we were
well aware of their branding and quality. We had witnessed our nephews‚Äô
progress and growth over the years and were impressed with the
outcomes.
Despite the overwhelming demand, we were fortunate to gain a placing
for Dexter in PG. He went on to spend 5 fruitful years in MindChamps
under the guidance of various teachers who have impacted his life. The
Principal, Ms Chris has been our beacon of light as we navigated
through Dexter‚Äôs early childhood. She was always just a phone call away
and a pillar of strength for us especially during the Covid period. The
teachers whom Dexter cross path with were equally dedicated and
remarkable. Ms Steph, who helmed Dexter‚Äôs PG to N2 class and Ms Zoe
who took over for K1 to K2. Ms Elli, Dexter‚Äôs phonics teacher and one
whom he looks forward to greeting every morning when he arrives at
school. Ms Xue, his Mandarin Teacher whom has miraculously made
him enjoy learning the language. Ah Yi, the chef who churns out healthy
meals for Dexter daily.
Both Mummy and myself are eternally grateful to all the staff at
MindChamps JTC as we understand that it takes a village to raise a
child. We want to extend our sincere appreciation and deepest thanks to
every single staff past and present. We are certain MindChamps has left

MindChamps PreSchool @ Holland Village,5,"My son has been attending Mindchamps @Holland Village since 18 months old. He became independent very fast in PG class and has since grown happily in the past 2.5 years.

One big thumb up for the school is its teachers. We can tell that the teachers care for the children with love from their hearts. They take care of their eating, napping, toileting, and also teach lessons and build their characters. They are encouraging when the children are hesitant to try new things, yet firm with what they can do and cannot do. They understand the different personalities of the kids and will adjust the teaching methods accordingly. They provide timely and detailed feedback to the parents. Ms. Alina, the principal of the school, is one of the most lovely ladies I have ever seen. She always talks with a smile on her face. Her tone itself is reassuring enough. She supports the children in every possible way that helps them thrive.

Another big thumb up for the school is its curriculum. The curriculum is well-designed with tons of enrichments. For example, the kids have their learning journey every month. My son is so excited to tell us about what he sees outside the school during his learning journeys! Every week, he is looking forward to the music class and gourmet moments. Academically, he is able to read and write simple words and Chinese characters at 4-years old!

MindChamps PreSchool @ Holland Village,5,"We enrolled our daughter at MindChamps Preschool when she was 2 years old, and the transformation we've witnessed has been truly remarkable. From the very beginning, we noticed a positive shift in her demeanour, curiosity, and overall development.

MindChamps' holistic approach to early childhood education has played a pivotal role in her growth. The curriculum, designed to foster creativity, critical thinking, and social skills, has provided her with a solid foundation for learning. Through engaging activities like Champs‚Äô Discovery and personalized attention from dedicated teachers, she has blossomed into a confident and inquisitive young learner.

One of the most significant improvements we've observed is in her communication skills. She now expresses herself with clarity and confidence, eagerly sharing her thoughts and ideas with others. Moreover, her problem-solving abilities have greatly enhanced, as she tackles challenges with resilience and determination.

Additionally, we're thrilled to note huge improvement in her Chinese language proficiency. MindChamps' immersive The Love for Chinese Language programme has ignited her interest in Mandarin, and she now converses fluently and comfortably in both English and Mandarin, a skill we know will serve her well in the future.

It's worth mentioning that my elder son also attended MindChamps Preschool from PG to K2, and we saw tremendous improvement in him as well. Witnessing his growth and development during his time at MindChamps was one of the reasons why we chose the same preschool for my daughter. The positive impact it had on my son's academic and personal development gave us confidence in the school's ability to provide an enriching and nurturing environment for my daughter as well.

Moreover, she is a very active child who loves performing. MindChamps has provided her with numerous opportunities to explore her passion for movement and expression through various activities in the Creativity and Theatrical Strategies as well as Neuromooves classes. These experiences have not only allowed her to channel her energy in a positive way but have also contributed to her physical coordination and confidence.

Beyond academic achievements, MindChamps has also nurtured her emotional intelligence and character development. She demonstrates empathy, kindness, and respect towards her peers, embodying the values instilled by the school.

As parents, we couldn't be more delighted with her progress at MindChamps Preschool. It's evident that she‚Äôs not only learning, but also thriving in an environment that values her individuality and encourages her to reach full potential. We're grateful to the dedicated teachers and staff who have played a pivotal role in her journey, and we look forward to seeing her continued growth and success in the years to come.

Thank you, MindChamps, for providing our daughter with a nurturing and enriching preschool experience.",2024-06-29T01:57:18.904Z,retail

The Schoolhouse West Coast,5,"After looking at several preschools, we chose The Schoolhouse because we were impressed with them. The principal on our tour was able to concisely explain the educational/developmental goals behind everything at the school, from large-scale aspects of the curriculum to small-scale in-class activities. She could even explain the child developmental reasoning behind why the school purchased certain toys over others. It all seemed so thoughtfully designed.

My daughter started at the youngest level and continued all the way through (until the end of K2). She enjoyed going to school every day and always spoke warmly of her teachers and principal. She never felt stressed there, yet she learned so much that she is at a strong advantage in primary school. The Schoolhouse helped her through many of childhood's challenges with patience and experience, and my daughter and her classmates all grew to become great friends over the years. Her time at The Schoolhouse concluded with a delightful graduation musical that included many well-produced performances by the children and even the teachers.

Great communication between the parent/child and the center (Mr. AJ and the team). Knowing that I was unwell, the center constantly reminded me of the forthcoming lesson or changes to the lesson time so that Jerel would not miss the lesson as it was a critical year for all P6 students.

Mr. AJ will provide constructive and helpful feedback so that I can make wise decisions. Proposing alternatives / additional learning lessons to improve my son's learning in preparation for the PSLE in 2024.

My son's improvement from getting a constant average grade to getting a satisfactory grade is commendable.  Matrix encouraged Jerel not to give up; nurturing him to continue to maintain/develop an interest in doing Maths. The positive reinforcement does improve his confidence to a certain extent.

As the class size is small, the teacher (Mr. Foo) allows for more individualized attention which benefits my son to fit his learning pace/needs.

Jerel is comfortable with the Home-Matrix distance as it is a straight bus journey taking bus number 180.  Passing by the Jurong East Sports Centre simply brightens up his bus ride for tuition as he is a sports lover.  Convenient and with a coffee shop downstairs, Jerel always looks forward to attending the class followed by his favorite Kolo Mee before heading home.

I have confidence that Matrix will continue to help Jerel to build a solid foundation of knowledge in Maths and he will be able to meet his realistic academic goals.

Once again, thank you Matrix :-)",2024-12-07T05:16:06.472Z,Retail

My Little Kingdom Preschool,5,"Dear Ms Yvonne Yeo and Teachers,

After watching the camping footage of my son Enxi and his classmates, may I share with you some of my thoughts.

First and foremost, I would like to say congratulations to you all. it is a very successful camping event. Enxi and his classmates did have fun and learn a lot.  However it is not only a simple excursion or holiday retreat.

As I can see teachers really designed a very meaningful and classical itinerary, from library to food court, from water park to supermarket, which covers almost all important scenes in our life. most importantly, kids were learning and being taught how to be social and emotional beings during this camping. i had never expected Enxi could receive education like this, which could be his most precious childhood or preschool experience and memory.

one more time, let me take this chance to say thank you, ms yvonne' s team, your pedagogical concept is fantastic and successful, your dedications to early childhood education are enormous and laudable! Good job!

In the short time span of merely 5 months, she has created so many core and fond memories of her preschool. She will always come back from school telling us how much fun she had with her teachers and friends. MLK is beyond the traditional school setting where all the children are free to be themselves and is like a second home to many. The holistic and well rounded curriculum helps my girl to pick up languages, social skills, creativity and other skills which is crucial to her development at this age. All the teachers put in their 101% in their lesson plans (be it indoor or outdoor) and more so for bigger events such as sports days, national day celebration and the more recent children‚Äôs day. I can never thank Ms Yvonne enough for her vision and perseverance that made MLK a top notch preschool in this area.

For the 17 days she was with us, I barely got any rest and had to deal with and put up with several issues. When she had a medical emergency and had to leave, I decided to go without a nanny, but given unforeseen circumstances, I ended up arranging a replacement.

The team at Aunty Confinement were immensely understanding and quick to help with any questions or concerns I had. A special shoutout to Jaslene and Snow for helping to get a replacement sorted so quickly.

I was then introduced to Aunty Maggie Teoh (pictured), who truly became a lifesaver. In just 11 days, she helped me rest and gave me the confidence to handle my baby and breastfeeding/pumping journey without guilt. Maggie is proactive, patient, and always ready to share her experience. She also made sure I had delicious, nutritious meals while training me and my baby to manage feedings and time between feedings more efficiently.

First Steps Preschool @ Jurong,5,"First steps Jurong- previously called Kids Mansion is an excellent place to enroll your children.

My older daughter and her cousins, alongside with our friends' children were all enrolled to the childcare centre since PG and they have since graduated.

My younger son is currently in the childcare centre and loves attending school. He doesn't have reluctance to go to school every morning and he often shares his joy at school with us.

The teachers are warmth and helpful. Especially teachers like Teacher Zann, Diana, Ying jie, Doris, Anna,the Chinese teachers and many others.

They have a structural approach where by the same teachers takes the same year of students every year and we can witness the growth of our children in terms of behaviour and discipline

Some teachers will spend some time talking to you about the children's performance when you pick your children up from school.

They have a yearly concert for the past few years that was self designed, self choreographed by the teachers themselves and it was for all levels. This is a very good platform for children to showcase their learning to their parents. The level of performance is amazing.

I am also very elated to see how they handle students with special needs. We hear of very good feedback on this area too

The school was previously taken over by another owner and we could feel the difference in the environment. We were hesitant to continue our son in the school.

However, we are all elated and happy to hear that Benny is taking over the school once again. Benny is one very passionate principal who is actively involved in the school' daily activities.

We are confident that with his leadership once again, the school will be an awesome childcare once again!

If you want a centre that uses not just hard skills, but soft skills and also teachers who teaches with the heart, try this centre!

We highly recommend any parent to have a non obligatory chat with Principal Benny if you are keen.

Science Studios Learning Centre - Bukit Timah Plaza,5,"Science Studios is an extremely awesome tuition centre as the notes are very useful and the teachers there are very kind, helpful and patient. I have a really great time going to Science Studios and have always been looking forward to every lesson as they always have hands-on experiments and quizzes(Kahoot!) which are very fun and exciting. These helped me to understand the topic more and understanding it while having fun, giving me more interest in Science which made me feel more enthusiastic about learning a new topic. There would be quizzes at the end of every lesson and practice papers by Science Studios when exams are near. The teachers will always help me if I have any queries and will always stop to explain if someone doesn‚Äôt understand. They will also give you some small token of encouragement if you submit your homework promptly. My Science was really poor in P3 (at AL5) and with Science Studios‚Äô help in P4, my grades improved and I got AL2 for PSLE!
Thank you Science Studios for blessing me with a strong foundation for Science.üòÅ

Green Pastures Child Centre,5,"We transferred our eldest daughter to Green Pastures Preschool for K2, and we were amazed at her transformation. When she started, she could barely recognize simple words and struggled with vocabulary compared to her peers. But thanks to the experienced, dedicated teachers, within just a year, she was reading and writing so well‚Äîwe were absolutely amazed!

When our second child joined Green Pastures, we had to move her to a different preschool after we shifted house. However, we quickly noticed she was way ahead of her classmates, bored, and not learning much. The food also was terrible compared to Green Pastures‚Äô delicious meals! So, within months, we transferred her back‚Äîand she‚Äôs now thriving, loving her lessons, enjoying the food, and very happy every day.

What I really like about Green Pastures:
‚ÄêStable, experienced teachers who truly know each child (unlike other preschools with constant teacher changes).
-A large, safe outdoor playground
-Engaging year-end performances that build confidence and showcase their learning.
-Strong Christian values woven into daily lessons‚Äîsomething we deeply appreciate.
-easy communication with teachers and principal, frequent updates of photos and videos of their activities

Green Pastures Child Centre,5,"This is a wonderful kindergarten that will see your child through from 18 months to kindergarten 2.

I am a mother of 5 and my 3 younger children attended Green Pastures. I have had the blessing of being a parent of Green Pastures for over the past 7 years. I've had other experiences with preschools in the neighborhood and in my opinion GP has been the best.

GP will bring your children up with LOVE and they are committed to imparting the right VALUES in them. Which is really all that these little ones need at this point in their lives. GP teachers tend to follow their class group from N1 to K2 which means the children do not have the stress of acclimatising to a new personality every year. This is something our family continues to cherish about this school.  This has provided our children with the sense of family within the school which has contributed to filling them with a deep sense of stability and the confidence to build strong relationships later on in primary school. Growing our children up in love and stability has become an underrated feature of our early education and this is what Green Pastures does best.

If you ever get to visit the school, you will be greeted by a warm red brick house and a beautiful playground set under the loving boughs of one of the oldest rain trees in Singapore. In the same way that this ancient sage tree is home and hearth to many tropical ferns, vines, squirrels, woodpeckers and other wonderful avian visitors - GP has provided my family with deep roots in love and my children the opportunity to use this support to go on to grow their own communities.",2025-05-16T02:05:22.383Z,food and beverages

Eshkol Valley @ Sengkang Pearl Pte Ltd,5,"My daughter 4yo and my son 2yo have been with Eshkol Valley since their PG age from 18mo. I have so much comfort from the teacher as anxious parent on how my daughter will adapt being separated from me to start her first day. The first 2 weeks was tough, my daughter would cry and throw out due to crying but teachers and the aunties there were so assuring and told me it‚Äôs okay and it‚Äôs normal. They are so patient to say it‚Äôs okay to needing to change her daily and mop the mess my daughter created due to all her crying.

The daily updates from principal/teacher via WhatsApp (now they have school communicate and photo sharing App) on how my daughter are doing for the first two weeks helped me to have a peace of mind and assurance. My daughter adapted and less crying very quicker than I imagined it would be.

She have learned so much in speech, identifying, socialising, writing, trying to read words, etc in English and even improved so much in her Mandarin.

My spouse and I seen how our daughter grew to become so independent and the things she learnt there are really broad and sometime in our opinion deep for her age, example identifying all the planets and remembers them, saying all the shapes include ‚Äòrhombus shape‚Äô. etc. We too have our son joined the sister and seen him grew in fast pace especially in speech.

My son went through a tough 1 week of separation anxiety too but very comfortably adapted to it after and love going to school. Seeing him so comfortably walking in as if he entered his second home felt very comforting.

I love how the curriculum involve parents and children time to accomplish a task. It helps us to bond with our kids and also create meaningful moments and conversation around doing homecraft together.

All the teachers are so dedicated. Their love and care for the children can be seen on how they update you about your children. I remember indicating I wish my daughter to improve in her mandarin speaking in the next term during one of our parent-teacher meet, I saw progress of my daughter really improve in making initiative to speak in mandarin and identifying mandarin words.

Both my children love their teachers so much! Can see my daughter excitement everytime she talks about her teachers and about her day at school. And my son so happy and cheerful to see his favourite teacher at the door so welcoming. It is so heartwarming watch they enjoy school and know that they are in safe environment and are in good caring hands.

PEM Confinement Nanny Agency Pte Ltd,5,"Esther Tey Bee Hong (2292) was an amazing confinement nanny for our family! She was so patient and calm with our baby boy. She easily fit into our home and worked well with our helper and our 19 month old daughter as well. She is a very hard worker, cooks delicious meals and kept everything clean and organized. We already miss her food! She helped me get a good amount of rest every day and night so I was able to heal well from my c section. We are Australian and her English and communication skills were very good. We never had an issue with communicating our needs and there was always a clear schedule at home for the meal times, breastfeeding and rest times. I will be recommending her to all my friends who would like to have a confinement nanny with the PEM agency. We have had a really great experience. Thank you, Esther!",2025-08-24T03:40:08.615Z,Hotels
PEM Confinement Nanny Agency Pte Ltd,5,"Aunty Ying (#1855) has been an amazing nanny for our baby in August 2025. We would like to thank her for her attention to detail and genuine care for us and our baby.

From the moment she started, we were impressed by her meticulous approach to everything, from preparing confinement meals to ensuring the baby's safety. She's always anticipating our baby's needs and catching small things that we might have missed.

She is very experienced and generously shares her knowledge with us and even takes the time to explain to us the reason behind her methods. We really appreciate how she repeats important advice, like how to properly burp the baby, how to prep bottles for pumping, or how store milk in the freezer. This repetition isn't just helpful, it shows her genuine commitment to making sure we are well-prepared and confident as parents.

Aunty Ying has become a cherished part of our family during her stay. Her professionalism, kindness, and deep love for what she does shine through in every interaction. We highly recommend her to any family looking for a nanny who goes above and beyond. A nanny with a big heart!

Sad to see her leave but at least we know we had a wonderful experience with Aunty Ying from PEM!

PEM Confinement Nanny Agency Pte Ltd,5,"I am thankful for Nanny Lai Chun‚Äôs (#1888 - Ten Lai Chun) help during this confinement period. As a first time mom, I struggle with knowing how to care for baby and also myself after delivery. Nanny Lai Chun was consistently assuring, supportive and patient in terms of caring for both my baby and me.

In terms of baby‚Äôs hygiene, she is extremely thorough, clean and diligent, going the extra mile to check baby‚Äôs diaper frequently and changing it promptly. I also appreciate that she is always willing to share and recommend good practices and baby products that she came across using with previous clients. Overall, she genuinely cares and tends to my baby very well. I feel assured leaving my baby under her care.

In terms of mother‚Äôs care, though she has her pov re how things need to be done and is open to share them, but she is also very aware and sensitive to my preferences. She would check in on how I feel, how I want things to be done and what kinds of food I like and tries her best to prepare them for me. She also takes initiative to provide extra help eg put my clothes in to wash (on top of doing baby‚Äôs) whenever she has the time or bandwidth to do so.

Nanny Lai Chun is generally also easy going and friendly. I find myself being able to chat comfortably with her about life and this helps me to get through the sometimes tiring confinement days. Thank you again, Nanny Lai Chun!",2025-08-23T11:52:10.103Z,Arts
