Apex Medical Centre Pte Ltd,1,"do not be in healthcare industry if you lack basic empathy. Counter staff in her 30s were extremely rude, shouted at my elderly grandma. We spend money to see doctor because we are ill, not to be scolded. Come at your own risk.",2025-04-01T10:46:33.037Z,healthcare
Apex Medical Centre Pte Ltd,1,"I was told by one of the clinic assistant at 615pm that the doctor would be available at 7pm, with my turn likely around 8-830pm. This is frustrating, as if the clinic had answered my call earlier and issued a queue number, I could have gone home to have dinner, shower, and return on time. Instead, I had no choice but to wait at the clinic, as going home would have been too rushed and risked missing my turn.

I attempted to purchase medication but was met with unhelpful and poorly trained auntie staff who was unable to advise me on suitable options based on my prescription history. The lack of professionalism and competence from the clinic assistants is deeply disappointing.

I have decided not to return to this clinic and will lodge a formal complaint with the MOH and inform the area MP. Patients deserve better service and proper training for clinic staff to avoid such inconveniences.",2025-02-11T11:40:51.264Z,healthcare

Apex Medical Centre Pte Ltd,1,"If you’re looking for poor diagnosis, wasted time, and rude customer service, this clinic is the place to go.

I had the unfortunate experience of visiting this clinic twice in 2024, both times being consulted by Dr. Goh.

1.	August 2024 – I sprained my thumb, and the pain extended to my wrist. I explained that I couldn’t move my thumb, and my wrist was in significant pain. Dr. Goh briefly examined my wrist and simply stated that it was sprained. He prescribed ointment, but the pain worsened over the next week. I later visited a polyclinic where the doctor provided a more thorough assessment, diagnosing a nerve injury in my wrist that required a steroid injection. After being referred to a hospital and receiving the injection, I recovered fully within three days.

2.	September 2024 – I experienced heavy menstrual bleeding for two weeks. Dr. Goh advised me to take Norethisterone for 20 days to stop the flow. When I asked if it was necessary to take it for so many days, he insisted it was. He also added that I should take high blood pressure pills, despite me telling him I don’t have high blood pressure. He tested my blood pressure three times and insisted it was abnormal. I explained that I’ve had low blood pressure most of my life and that the elevated reading might be due to panic after bleeding excessively. He refused to reconsider, claiming that high blood pressure pills would reduce the bleeding. When I tested my blood pressure at home, it was normal.

3.	Patient Privacy Concerns – There’s absolutely no regard for patient privacy in this clinic. Two of the counter staff (packing medication and collecting payments) are respectful, speaking softly when dealing with patients’ personal information. However, the two seated behind the counter never get up and instead shout out patients’ full names, NRIC numbers, house addresses, and phone numbers for everyone to hear. During both of my visits, I witnessed them shouting at elderly patients. On one occasion, an elderly man mentioned it was his first time at the clinic, and the staff loudly responded, “Why must you come here?” I also saw a middle-aged woman buying medication without her physical NRIC. Instead of proper verification, the seated staff simply asked her to recite her NRIC number and proceeded to sell the medication. Isn’t this dangerous? Why isn’t there a proper process in place? People come to the clinic unwell – the least they deserve is respectful treatment.",2024-10-02T16:18:30.943Z,healthcare

Apex Medical Centre Pte Ltd,5,"I dare say this clinic's handling covid the best out of the 4 clinics in the area.

They actually had signs out to tell patients when the queue is full (I highly recommend putting Chinese / Malay / Tamil signs too, at the side of the counter facing out to the door. Might help elderly patients and foreign workers who do not know English). This is already a world of difference from another clinic I shall not name, which I waited at for 30 mins yesterday only to be told to head over to the next door clinic and wait for 2.5H, because I'm not company sponsored. (They didn't even put a sign, srsly. Half the queue were not company sponsored.)

They also had special signs for people who self-tested ART positive too. Unlike yet another clinic in the area I shall not name, which claimed to do Swab tests online but turned me away in person saying 'no swab test here', APEX is legit. They understood the need when I told them I'm ART positive. They accommodated me when I asked if I could be given a queue no. for couple of hours later, despite the queue being full. Sure their phone line may be down, but their in-person service definitely benefits from that.

Service-wise, the staff were most efficient and polite, and I'm really thankful to Dr Tay, who cracked a joke when she saw how sombre I was about getting covid. The brave lady did not even bulk when I pulled down my mask, despite my fear of transmitting Covid to her. Kudos to her!

If there is one complain I do have, it would be the signage out at the front. It's good that APEX gets along so well with the Universal Dental Group that they even share similar letter fonts, but at first, I didn't dare go in thinking I might end up strapping myself in for a teeth drilling session. Now's not the time for sure, but in the future, when Covid does lighten up, hopefully the clinic will consider rebranding with different letter fonts, if not add an Upstairs and Downstairs Arrow logo alongside the different establishments.",2022-02-08T12:21:48.757Z,healthcare

As I have queries over the recent study put up by NTU-TCM department, I raised queries with the researcher, Mr Peter Lim who was not able to address my concerns. A contact number to the TCM clinic was provided for me to reach out to Dr Zhong but I was told by the clinic that is not a number to reach the main investigator. After I feedback to Mr Peter Lim, he did not offer me a direct email to Dr Zhong. I found Dr Zhong’s email and wrote her an urgent mail for her to respond. She did not attend to my email since Wednesday, 23/4/25. Due to the non response I emailed QSM of NTU yet my email was also unattended. There was also no follow-up effort from Mr Peter Lim although the issue was as important as the handling of patient’s urine specimen.

Fullerton Dental,1,"Dr. Mok who works every Wednesday is really irresponsible.

40 days ago I paid a very high price to have a tooth fixed. After about 40 days, the filling developed a problem and it hurt when I drank cold water. So, I suspect that the material has fallen out, but of course, it could be something else, so I want to go for a review. Dr. Mok said she would remove the previous material and replace it with one that was temporary and did not guarantee results. I expressed my concern because once the medication failed, my teeth would be exposed and more damage would be done. Then,  after I refused to use this material, I asked if I could use the original material and Dr. Mok refused. So I decided not to change because, after all, no one wants to revert to a temporary, less good-looking material without taking that much risk. Dr. Mok went on to say that if I were to leave, she would have to take a photograph of my teeth to prove that there was nothing wrong with her fillings. I thought this was utterly ridiculous. If she was so adamant that there was no problem, why did she change me to a bad material in the first place? If I don't change the material, do I have to prove that her padding is fine? I felt that she was simply shirking her responsibility. She would not allow me to leave if I refused to have my photo taken because the case had to be documented. High charges + bad attitude + shirking responsibility make me very unhappy and I hope someone will pay attention to this matter.",2022-04-13T14:04:00.683Z,healthcare

Fullerton Health Medical Centre for Migrant Workers @ Gul Circle,1,"I am writing to express my disappointment with the service I received during my visit to your facility on 10/Mar/2025. I arrived at 5:00 PM, well before your advertised closing time of 5:30 PM, only to be informed that registration had already closed at 4:30 PM. This crucial information was not mentioned on Google or any of your public platforms, which led to confusion and wasted time.

Additionally, the receptionist’s manner of communication was unprofessional and dismissive. Rather than offering assistance or understanding, I felt disregarded and unwelcome. Clear, respectful communication is fundamental to good service, and unfortunately, that standard was not met.

To avoid future misunderstandings, I strongly recommend updating your public information to clearly state the registration cut-off time. I also hope you will address customer service standards with your staff to ensure visitors are treated with respect and courtesy.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing how you plan to improve this experience for future customers.",2025-03-10T09:23:44.309Z,healthcare

Message from NIE said that the complusory health screening is free. However, before any screening is done, I was asked to pay $55. The staff said that they had informed NIE about the miscommunication. Payment cannot be made by VISA as their machine is down.

Procedure:
Before the health screening, we had to print out a form to fill in physically. It's quite long, detailing not just our personal medical details but also our family's medical history. During the screening, the nurse fill in another form with the test results. After that, we were ushered to a tablet station to key in everything again digitally, rendering all the hard copies redundant. The digital form is 15 pages long, and the touchscreen is not sensitive, so it took a very long time to key in those information that took a very long time to complete on hardcopy in the first place.

Privacy:
The waiting room for X-ray consists of 2 rows of chairs placed facing each other and in uncomfortably close distance. (Note that females are required to remove their bras and wear only plain T-shirts.) There's a curtain to separate the waiting room from the rest of the clinic, but once we're called for the X-ray, we'll have to go out. (Ladies, you might want to go with a jacket to cover yourself.)

National Cancer Centre Singapore,1,"Don’t tell people to put wheelchair outside hallway for public use when they still need it. You know how hard it is to find another in the other floors beside entrance? If the patients need the wheelchair they would’ve got the chair before they entered.

I visited the hospital with my grandma today and when she went in for her treatment, I waited for her outside and decided to wheel the empty wheelchair to an area with seat.

An older nurse stop me and ask that I placed the wheel chair outside. I said my grandma still wants to use the wheel chair as she’ll only be inside for a short while, but she still insisted I put it outside so everyone can use.

Can you for the love of god use your head and understand the reason why it’s a dumb idea to ask patient to put wheel chair outside the hallway? There is literally no wheelchair outside especially when there is a lot of visitors. Why do you think all of us are bringing the wheelchair with us whenever we go?

If I put it outside “for someone to use” and they take the wheel chair, I need to go all the way to the ground floor because that’s the only place I know where to get wheel chair. If my grandmother alone came here, she put out then how? Can’t find the wheel chair and ask her go all the way first floor to get?? If my grandfather came instead, he need go all the way to the first floor. You only want young people to accompany patient is it?

Trouble another nurse to get wheelchair all the way from first floor? I’m sure they don’t exactly know where to find wheel chairs either in the other floor. It’s near impossible because I also had to find wheelchair in the other floor before.

You know I’m honestly applaud and offended, like if this was my grandmother I don’t think she even knows where to find the wheel chair after she put outside. And is it even necessary to tell us this? If you have limited wheelchairs I understand, but I visited the hospital and there are numerous wheelchairs outside the entrance ground floor. It comes off as a little too insensitive and stuck up. Also why am I the only one who was told this?? She never even tell the other older visitors who are accompanying the patient. When my mother came to me she immediately stop what she said and left?? Just because I’m a young person doesn’t mean I won’t put up a bad review or complaint.",2025-07-08T09:30:50.875Z,healthcare

National Cancer Centre Singapore,5,"✨ A heartfelt thank you to Dr. David and Dr. Brian ✨

As a medical professional myself, I can genuinely say that meeting Dr. David, my father’s oncologist at Singapore National Cancer Centre (NCCS), has been one of the most inspiring experiences in this journey.

From the very first appointment, I could see his depth of knowledge, professionalism, and compassion. His clinical judgment is exceptional — calm, clear, and deeply reassuring. I’ve learned so much just by being in the room with him during my father’s visits.

Despite being told in Dubai that my father might have a new cancer, Dr. David’s expertise helped reveal that this was not the case. His careful review and insight proved that the earlier findings were incorrect — and for that, my entire family is deeply grateful. I’m truly happy I traveled all the way from Dubai for this opinion and treatment. It was absolutely worth it.

I also want to thank Dr. Brian, my father’s surgeon at Singapore General Hospital, for his excellent care and support throughout this process.

Thank you, Dr. David and Dr. Brian — you have both made a profound difference in our lives. Looking forward to seeing you again in three months, insha’Allah.

Institute of Mental Health,1,"Hi any readers,

For your best information, about this hospital IMH, the doctors and staffs are good, but I have to try my luck to find my sister's doctor in charge, and the medical doctors and nurses like to use verbally call to inform and get consent from the parents of the patient, which is really an unethical method!

And, when I called in and make an appointment, the IMH customer service will say the doctor to call back, but no call received so is a waste of time!

Meanwhile, the worst part is the IMH doctor-in-charge did not get the patient's next of kin's/ parents' sign consent before sending my sister for ETC brain treatment, and will said that they have the doctor's rights of detaining patients as hospitalized in IMH.

Then, even worst part is IMH didn't provide these following reports to patient's next of kin/ the parents such as medical reports/ attempted medical treatments/ report/ types of further medical treatments report/ medicines assigned to patients during hospitalized in IMH.

In such way, the doctor-in-charge proceeded ETC brain treatments to my sister, with a verbally call consent, while the next of kin / the parents of patient had rejected it by all means.

Which of it, it is an illegal act of action from IMH, and I would like to let the people who has this similiar situation, to report to the Singapore medical council or association/ lodge a police report/ file a warning letter to IMH/ and hired a lawyer for claim back patient's rights/ to apply for discharged from IMH immediately by next of kin/ the parents of the patient, due to patient's incapacity due to sickness or illness to rejecting any unknown medical treatments assigned to the patients.

As there is no right or wrong for any brain treatments provided by any hospitals, if any, unsuccessful treatments which has already caused damages to the patient's brain.

This is why i felt so disappointed on IMH medical practices and procedures on handling any patients in IMH.

So, i would like to highlight the consequences for patient's rights being violated or suffered harm due to:
1) Medical negligence/ malpractice,
2) Violation of patient rights, including of failing to obtain parent's consent,
3) Illegal treatments without proper authorization or administering treatments by obtaining parent's consent
4) providing particulars of the doctor-in charge who is handling patient's medical diagnosis and treatments
5) the difficulty of finding the doctor-in-charge with no appointment with the next-of-kin / the parents of the patient.

Therefore, the goodness of diagnosis or medical treatments are not well appreciated by myself and the parents of the patients.",2025-07-09T05:14:44.569Z,healthcare

Gleneagles Hospital,1,"Premium hospital, substandard service

I wish to express my deep disappointment with the service standards at Gleneagles Hospital, following my admission experience earlier this week.

I arrived at 8:00am for admission and collected a queue number, only to find the queue completely stagnant. When I approached the counter staff, I was brushed off with “wait a while” — without explanation, updates, or communication. Eventually, after wasting much time, I was told to proceed to the Day Admission Ward at Level 7.

What followed was even worse. The staff at the ward counter literally tossed the admission letter at me and asked me to sign, with no guidance or courtesy. When I asked twice for clarification, I was given casual, dismissive gestures that turned out to be misleading. Even when I highlighted the mistake, the staff remained cold and indifferent. While a manager eventually came forward to apologise, there was no sincerity or accountability — only a token gesture.

On top of that, the food served was shockingly inadequate for a hospital that positions itself as “prestigious.” Breakfast consisted of plain porridge with tofu and peanuts, accompanied only by black coffee. Cold milk was provided only upon request. There was no fruit, no proper protein, and certainly no sign of a balanced or nutritious diet. For patients who are supposed to be recovering, such meals fall far short of basic expectations, and one must question if they even meet minimum hospital nutrition standards.

What shocked me further was the complete lack of follow-up. Until my discharge, I never once received a call or visit from Gleneagles’ management. By contrast, hospitals such as KKH and Thomson respond almost immediately to patient complaints, often sending senior staff to check on patients personally. Gleneagles’ silence reflected indifference, not care.

For a hospital that charges premium rates and brands itself as a top-tier institution, this experience was utterly disappointing. Patients come to Gleneagles expecting care, respect, professionalism, and proper recovery support — but what I encountered was stagnation, disregard, and even nutritionally questionable food.

Gleneagles should remember: healing is not just about medicine, but also dignity, respect, and nourishment. Anything less is unacceptable.",2025-08-19T05:15:00.111Z,healthcare

Gleneagles Hospital,1,"Summary of Complaint Regarding ICU Care at Gleneagles Hospital

Our family experienced deeply upsetting and unprofessional treatment during our grandfather’s recent stay in the Intensive Care Unit at Gleneagles Hospital. Despite paying a significant amount with the expectation of receiving world-class care, the service and professionalism we encountered were severely lacking.

Key concerns include:
•	Unprofessional Conduct by ICU Staff: Nurse Corina and another filipino male nurse displayed dismissive, rude, and mocking behavior toward our family members. Reasonable requests and questions were met with false information, poor attitudes, and a lack of empathy — all of which are unacceptable in a healthcare environment.

•	Disrespectful Behavior by Dr. Roger Tan: Dr. Tan’s tone became increasingly sarcastic and impatient, particularly when we needed to translate medical updates for a family member who does not speak English. Need to translate to Palembang dialect. In addition, conflicting medical opinions among ICU doctors about dialysis treatment created confusion and concern over the consistency of care.

•	Lack of Communication and Continuity: After initially encouraging open communication, Dr. Tan became less responsive. Despite our family’s efforts, including arranging an SOS medical evacuation and bearing high costs.  There was no notable improvement in our grandfather’s condition. During a critical phase, both primary doctors left the country for a conference, handing the case over to a new doctor unfamiliar with the situation.

•	Concerns Over Staffing Levels: Night shifts appeared to be understaffed, with a few nurse on duty for many ICU patients, raising serious questions about patient safety and monitoring. One is to two patients.

Given the circumstances and the substantial financial and emotional investment our family made, we are extremely disappointed with the level of care received.

Through our 3 nights stay with Alvernia, almost everyone we encountered was so sweet and helpful. During the birthing process especially -- despite the tension being high in the labor room, I was glad that we were surrounded by really positive nurses, midwives, and of course, our gynae too who were so assuring the whole time.

The lactation consultant was also very warm who gave off loving, motherly vibes. We returned to see her abt 2 weeks after discharge as I was stressing over breastfeeding and I felt very much at ease with her empathetic behavior. While she continued to encourage breastfeeding, she constantly reminded us to also prioritize our mental well-being and our baby's needs as well.

Facilities wise, truly nothing to complain. We stayed at one of the suites and it was clean and very well maintained. The meals were decent but still better than most hospital meals we've ever had and it's great that there were options to choose from!

I can confidently say that my experience with Alvernia was so memorable that I'd choose to deliver here again if I'm ever pregnant again in the future! Thank you to the maternity team for taking care of me and baby well during our stay! :)",2025-08-15T15:09:57.683Z,healthcare

Dr Looi Lai Mun and Dr Daniel Chan Boon Yeow,

On behalf of my family, I would like to express our deepest gratitude for the compassionate and professional care you provided to my late mother, Mdm Wong during her time at Mount Alvernia Hospital.

To ICU and St Francis Ward nurses — your patience, attentiveness, and kindness brought great comfort to both my mother and our family during a very difficult period. Your tireless efforts and gentle presence did not go unnoticed and we are truly thankful.

To Dr Looi and Dr Chan — thank you for your dedicated and thoughtful medical care. We deeply appreciate the time you took to explain her condition to us, your honest guidance, and the calm reassurance you provided throughout.
(Special thanks to Dr Looi who provided me guidance to support my mum's wish to return home in such a short notice, heartfelt appreciation!)

----------------------------------
Dear Mount Alvernia's Business Centre Team,
I am writing to share my experience and express my sincere disappointment with how the billing was handled during a deeply distressing moment when my mother was being transferred by ambulance in critical condition.
While I understand the need to settle outstanding charges, I was asked to make payment before I could leave even as the ambulance was departing with my mother. This insistence on immediate payment, under such circumstances, felt lacking in compassion and empathy.
In moments of crisis, I believe families deserve some space and understanding. I hope the hospital can review its processes and empower staff to exercise discretion in such situations, so that others may be spared this added distress during already heartbreaking moments.

Mount Alvernia Hospital,5,"All the staff at Mt A were super efficient and nice! I want to especially compliment a male staff member from the Business Office, as he provided me with a lot of helpful information regarding my insurance claim. Although I didn’t get his name, he was the one who spoke very fast (though I could still catch what he said). Kudos to him for being so helpful and informative!",2025-07-11T06:06:01.262Z,healthcare

Mount Alvernia Hospital,1,"Initially admitted to St. Francis Ward, I endured significant distress due to complications from general anesthesia (GA). I was unable to pass urine from midnight onwards and repeatedly told the nurses that my bladder felt like it was going to explode. Despite my clear and urgent complaints, the nurses performed a bladder scan and insisted my bladder was “not very full.” When they finally catheterized me after hours of agony, they drained an alarmingly large amount of urine—nearly double what they claimed was present. This dismissive and negligent attitude from the nurses was deeply upsetting and left me feeling unheard and invalidated.
The catheterization process was nothing short of a nightmare. Two nurses attempted to insert the catheter multiple times, causing excruciating pain and leaving me screaming. After several failed attempts, a senior nurse was finally called in to complete the procedure, and while her skill brought some relief, the overall process was traumatic. Even after the catheter was in place, I continued to experience pain and repeatedly raised this with the nurses. I specifically asked if they could check the catheter because of the persistent pain. One nurse brushed me off, saying, “Of course it would be painful; it is a foreign body in you,” and didn’t even bother to examine it. This complete lack of compassion and willingness to investigate my concerns was infuriating. When I was finally transferred to St. Raphael Ward—where the nurses were much kinder—the difference in care was immediately apparent. The nurses there asked me about the catheter, and when I mentioned that it still felt painful, they were prepared to check it. However, the same senior nurse from St. Francis Ward who was assisting with my transfer—the one who had repeatedly dismissed my concerns—intervened and brushed off my complaint yet again, saying, “It’s just discomfort.” Is she the one being catheterized? Her consistent dismissal of my pain, even when other staff were willing to help, was completely unacceptable, unprofessional, and uncompassionate.
This same senior nurse, who consistently dismissed my concerns, also exhibited aggressive and demeaning behavior throughout my stay. She scolded my caregiver in an unnecessarily harsh and condescending tone for helping me walk—a practice that my physiotherapist had explicitly approved. Not content with berating my caregiver, she then turned on me, speaking to me as though I were a child being punished. This was deeply humiliating and entirely uncalled for, especially given the already distressing circumstances I was enduring. Her behavior and repeated dismissive attitude made an already distressing experience feel unbearable. Their discharge process seems to required a complete transformation. Given that I could not walk and relied on a wheelchair, it was incredibly inconvenient and unreasonable to expect me to make my way to a different department to collect my medications. A hospital should prioritize patient convenience, especially for those with limited mobility, but this process was thoughtlessly designed. On top of that, they provided an interim bill during discharge, which required me to pay an excess. They explained that this was not the final bill and that the excess would be refunded once the bill was finalized. Why am I being charged for an interim bill that is not even finalized? This makes no sense and creates unnecessary administrative hassle. I have never encountered such a practice in other hospitals, and it speaks to a system that prioritizes inefficiency. This was my first experience at Mt. A, and it will undoubtedly be my last. The dismissive attitudes, lack of competence, aggressive behavior from staff, and poorly designed processes made this an incredibly distressing experience. For a Catholic hospital that claims to “serve all with love,” my experience felt entirely devoid of compassion or professionalism.",2025-06-28T07:34:55.872Z,healthcare
Mount Alvernia Hospital,4,"We’re incredibly grateful for the wonderful team of nurses who stood by us during such a special and life changing moment. As first-time parents, we were nervous and unsure but the nurses guided us with so much care, patience, and warmth.

Everyone we encountered from the nurses and cleaners to the chefs made us feel welcomed and supported. Their kindness truly meant a lot to us during this important time.

The only thing that dampened the experience was the air conditioning in our room. It couldn’t be adjusted due to a technical fault, and despite raising the temperature hours before, the room stayed too cold which made us worried for our newborn's comfort. It was frustrating when the maintenance team simply brushed off our concern with “it takes time,” even after we explained how long we had been trying to fix it.

Still, the care we received from the medical and support staff far outweighed this hiccup. Thank you all for taking such good care of our little family. We’ll always remember the warmth you gave us even if the room was cold.",2025-06-28T06:35:59.969Z,healthcare

Sengkang General Hospital,1,"I am writing on behalf of my husband, who recently had a highly distressing and unacceptable experience at your Emergency Centre. From the very moment we entered, we were deeply disappointed by the lack of professionalism—registration staff were laughing and talking among themselves instead of attending to patients, which was both inconsiderate and unprofessional.

At the triage stage, the situation was no better. The staff did not even look at my husband’s wound, despite him being in visible pain and distress. After being made to wait for hours in what was supposed to be an emergency setting, the only treatment offered to him was paracetamol. This was shocking and unacceptable, especially given that his arm was in fact fractured. We had no choice but to go to another emergency centre where he finally received the urgent and proper care he required.

What makes this matter even more concerning is that my husband was not the only one neglected. Many other patients were also left unattended for hours, without updates, care, or compassion. This shows a wider systemic issue rather than an isolated incident.

This entire experience raises very serious concerns: how can patients place their trust in medical professionals who overlook critical injuries, fail to show basic empathy, and dismiss urgent conditions? Emergency centres are meant to provide immediate, accurate, and compassionate care. Instead, my husband and many others were subjected to neglect, mismanagement, and unprofessional behaviour at multiple levels of your service.

I strongly urge the hospital to review this incident in detail and take immediate action to ensure that such lapses never happen again. No patient should be made to suffer unnecessarily in an emergency setting. I also request a written response from your management outlining the corrective measures that will be taken, and accountability from the staff involved.",2025-08-28T04:56:02.226Z,healthcare

When check at the counter for the delay they ask me to refer tv screen for the waiting time. Staffs are negligent to the core as if they working for free. There was barely 60 people in the waiting room which very low comparing to TTH. Even with heavy crowd volume TTH the service is faster. Regretted going to SENGKANG GENERAL HOSPITAL.

Sengkang General Hospital,1,"my family has the dishonour of living nearest to SKH because the SCDF emergency ambulance can only get us to the nearest hospital.

my family member needs a specific treatment from higher level of medical attention (our special care doctor is in NUH) but SKH has both an illogical protocol and no differentiation of their patients conditions. They refuse to let us transfer to NUH even with a private-hire ambulance because ""patient needs a ward first"" What ward? We have no time to waste in a general hospital when we require a specialist. Been sent to SKH twice and both times we waited more than 20hours OVERNIGHT in observation room.

Sengkang General Hospital,4,"I’m not going to comment on the A&E because, to me, the reality of healthcare today is clear. I’ve waited three hours for a specialist appointment at private hospitals, so I understand that demand is high and manpower shortages are real. There’s no point ranting or blaming the hospital it won’t change the situation. If people already have their own perceptions, nothing will change their mindset unless they experience it themselves.

The A&E at Sengkang General Hospital is always packed, with staff constantly on their feet. People need to understand that the system is stretched, and unnecessary visits only add to the burden.

I experienced a delayed diagnosis, likely because my symptoms seemed routine due to my job. But the pain was affecting my daily life. When I finally got the right treatment, the care I received was more compassionate than I had ever expected even more than what I felt from some colleagues.

Dr. Stanley Angkodjojo and his team in PATU, including nurses Cheryl, Michelle, Khatijah, Fen Fen, Pen Anbu, Xiu Hui, and NC Pua, were truly dedicated. While I was receiving care, they never stopped moving constantly running up and down, checking on me and other patients, never once having the chance to sit. I could hear their concern as they reassured patients, making sure everyone was looked after. Despite their hectic workload, they still took the time to be kind and attentive.

When I visited Dr. Stanley for my appointment, his treatment worked, and my symptoms were finally under control. Life felt normal again. I’m grateful to have been cared for by such a professional and compassionate doctor. I also want to acknowledge his PSA in the clinic, a Malay lady whose name I didn’t catch. She was incredibly patient, taking time to explain details, especially to elderly patients. His clinic nurse, whose name I also missed, was just as kind and attentive.

Having accompanied my mother and grandmother to different hospitals, I know how tough healthcare can be. I don’t make unreasonable requests because I see the pressure these professionals are under. The least we can do is recognize their dedication and respect their time and effort.",2025-08-18T07:26:46.240Z,healthcare

Sengkang General Hospital,1,"I am writing this review  regarding the unacceptable and unprofessional conduct of one of your staff members, Ms. Lim Qian Hui, who served as the instructor during my recent electric wheelchair training session at SKH.

As a senior citizen with knee joint degeneration and pain, I approached this session with the hope of receiving patient and supportive guidance. Unfortunately, my experience was quite the opposite. Ms. Lim displayed a noticeably short temper, a lack of compassion, and impatience throughout the session. She failed to provide clear instructions, and instead of calmly guiding me, she raised her voice and repeatedly scolded me in a harsh and disrespectful tone.

Her behavior caused me extreme emotional distress. I became frightened, my blood pressure spiked to 192, and I felt dizzy. I was so overwhelmed that I broke down in tears. This was not the first time I encountered such behavior from her — during my first visit, she also exhibited the same impatience and unprofessional attitude, even using her mobile phone while instructing me, which made me feel neglected and unsafe.

I expected professional care and respect, especially considering the vulnerable position of elderly patients learning to operate assistive devices. Ms. Lim’s conduct was entirely inappropriate and unacceptable.

I sincerely hope that SKH will look into this matter seriously and take appropriate action to ensure that future patients receive the dignity, patience, and professionalism they deserve.

Sengkang General Hospital,1,"I'm very disappointed @ their Emergency centre. The waiting time displayed was 2 hours max. However, tell me why even after 5 HOURS waiting in Acute Care, I'm still not attended to after blood test & 2 IV drips. I came @ around 5PM & walked out @ around 11PM. The nurses there are not attentive that my blood was even flowing down the tube when the last IV drip was done, it took another nurse from another section who passed by, to nudge one of them to do so. The nurse who did my blood test & IV drip wasn't around, probably changed shifts at that point of time. My throat already hurts as I keep feeling something @ my throat as if it were swelling/tightening & get nauseated easily when I open my mouth to yawn especially even after the IV drip. Keeping my hand raised & constantly looking for eye-contact with anyone of the nurses wasn't enough. After 5 hours of waiting I couldn't take it anymore & asked one of the male nurses, telling him I want to go home as it's been 5 hours of waiting & I haven't eaten or drank water THE WHOLE DAY because of my issue with swallowing, my mouth was very dry.  I could barely speak, it was very uncomfortable to get words out. Apparently patients have to inform nurses to leave as they need the tags, so tell me why, when I informed him, he just told me to wait some more for the doctor & that I can move to the waiting area OUTSIDE??? I insist on going home, they need to help me take out the needle but nope, I was ignored. As I turn to see a group of nurses at the entrance of Acute Care laughing about with one another, I could sense my panic attack coming & feel nauseated all over again. I looked at the clock @ around 11PM I got up & walked out of the hospital. Guess what? I did start to vomit & have a panic attack when I reached home, I went to private hospital instead. I haven't gone to SKH's Emergency before so I had expectations that they would be more efficient than CGH at least because it didn't look as crowded & my previous experiences of attending appointments @ SKH was good last year, 1 hour max. Why does the Emergency centre does not feel like an EMERGENCY at all? They only gave me a call at around 12AM & that was when I was vomiting & having a panic attack! I looked at my blood test record on HealthHub app & it says that they received it around 7PM & reported around 8PM. I understand that there were other patients to attend to, but 5 HOURS without food or water the whole day is really ridiculous & I keep seeing patients who came after me (have been attended to & ready to leave). I'm so disgusted that they didn't even adhere to my request to leave, I took out the tag & left it there, took out the needle at a private hospital. Thanks a lot to the group of nurses having a great time laughing @ 29/07/2025. I sat near the CCTV, not sure where the camera is facing but they can review themselves. Very disappointing, looks can be deceiving. If SKH looks less crowded than CGH? Doesn't mean you'll get attended to faster. Shame.",2025-07-30T01:13:07.883Z,healthcare

Alexandra Hospital,1,"Now reading this hospital's low ratings and the complaints, i feel better knowing i was not being critical. There is a reason why this hospital has such a low rating and reputation

Below is an exchange of what the main issue was after i was admitted and discharged from alexandra hospital. A cyst in liver was found but doctor jeanette ting did not mention a thing during the bed visit. I only found out during discharge which sent me into a panic when i saw i have an appt with the hepatobiliary and an ultrasound scan. After going home i got an sms asking how was my experience with AH and thats what made me thought this hospital cares to know, how wrong i was!!!

i approached the customer service AH_feedback@nuhs.edu.sg but doctor jeanette ting insisted on speaking on the phone instead of answering the questions in the email. So there was this lady named Joyce Tan in ""Patient Experience Matters"" being the middle person to pass the email message from doctor jeanette ting (see below exchange). There is a serious lack of accountability, and when questioned, they avoid admitting mistakes, and even cut further communication. When i requested for this doctor not to attend to me in future admissions, the fake nice lady Joyce Tan from AH_feedback@nuhs.edu.sg (where PATIENT EXPERIENCE MATTERS) then says ""we will disengage further communication on this matter."", dismissing my experience like i made it all up.

Qn) why no mention of cyst in liver n the followup appt during bed visits? I only found out abt this when i saw discharge paper stating hepatobiliary appt in july, which left me shock n confused, no word was mentioned by MO nor main doctor during bed visits on 22apr after my ct scan on 21apr

Ans from DR) During the ward round on 22nd April 2025, team had noted CT urography showed a liver cyst and the plan was for an outpatient ultrasound liver followed by appointment with the hepatobiliary (HPB) surgeon. Ward MO was to inform you about this. However, you were given the discharge documents by ward nurse prior to MO informing you about the liver cyst and plans for HPB follow up. Prior to your discharge, ward MO spoke to you about the liver cyst seen on CT urogram and the plan for outpatient ultrasound liver and HPB follow up thereafter. Ward MO had addressed your queries and you had no further questions.

Ans from me) On the 22apr morning when MO dropped by before Dr Jeanette, no mention of liver cyst. When dr jeanette finally came by, there was only mention of kidney cyst which i SPECIFICALLY REM we had a bit of a discussion on it about the followup with urologist was for the kidney cyst. NOTHING was said abt liver cyst!! Around 230pm when i got the discharge letter the appointment list mentioned hepatobiliary appt thats when i asked nurse to check for me what that was about, MO came and admitted it slipped his mind. And dr jeanette also said nothing abt this too! I never want to question further on this overlook even though i feel it is grossly negligent to not inform me as a patient on the discovery , i could have raised question by the bed. So when I penned this feedback i decided to mention this because it seems more negligence were experienced after looking back I want to reiterate that MO ONLY told me AFTER I QUERIED on it, i am a patient not a doctor, it is not my duty to make sure doc share with me my test results if i am not aware of it. So when your reply on this qn appears like they addressed it with me i felt like there was no accountability on their part to acknowledge they did overlook.

Final reply from DR) Please note that we will not be revisiting questions that have already been addressed. We maintain that there has been no negligence on our part in your care. If you have any new concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out.",2025-05-09T08:37:58.185Z,healthcare

The staff nurses and doctors on duty throughout the night, morning, and afternoon shifts on the 5th and 6th of April were exceptional. They were caring, professional, sweet, and friendly. The service was fast, efficient, and top notch. I was genuinely impressed by how attentive and responsive everyone was.

Even the food exceeded my expectations especially the Indian meals, which were delicious and comforting.

It was truly a comfortable and reassuring hospital stay. The team attended to my needs quickly and thoroughly, unlike what I’ve experienced in some other well-known hospitals. The doctors and nurses here were clearly experienced and didn’t just brush things off they listened and acted with genuine care.

I am amazed and incredibly thankful for everything. I sincerely hope that these high standards of care remain unchanged, even in subsidised wards.",2025-04-07T04:15:07.332Z,healthcare

Alexandra Hospital,5,"A much delayed review, on 11/2/25 8:30am, my mother, QLW 716D, saw Dr Ca Yin Leanne Leong at I Care Clinic.  She’s quite pregnant, (if I’m not wrong, she is giving birth in May) but she’s still very alert and enthusiastic telling us what we should know abt my mother’s swollen legs.  Most of the doctors that we have met in Singapore are all good, but she is really good.  She’s impressive because she is caring, makes the effort to explain relevant stuff to us and she looks at the list of medication my mother is taking in detail and takes out the one that gives the most side effects to see if it helps my 85 yr old mother’s condition.

Then days later, if I’m not wrong, she called my daughter Michelle to update Michelle on my mother’s condition.  (My mother is staying with my daughter, not with me.)  Thanks for the care provided. 💕

Ng Teng Fong General Hospital,1,"Absolutely unacceptable and dangerous experience at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital!

My father was admitted to A&E for UTI and high fever on 14th Aug. He kept telling the nurses for TWO DAYS that he had a fever, was shivering non-stop, and was in obvious pain. Every single time, they waved it off because their thermometer kept showing 36.8°C, claiming the reading was “not far off."" and that their devices were accurate!

It took my father, who was already sick and weak to WALK to the hospital’s own pharmacy, buy a thermometer himself, and prove his temperature was actually 38.6°C. Only THEN did they realised the thermometer was inaccurate!

This is BASIC patient care — if you can’t even measure temperature accurately or take patient symptoms seriously, how can anyone trust you to handle real emergencies? This kind of negligence is not just sloppy, it’s dangerous and could cost lives.

Shameful that a major hospital in Singapore allows such incompetence to happen. I hope MOH investigates because this is beyond ridiculous.

Wonder how many people have been misdiagnosed because of such lapses!

Just because I wore a military uniform and they wore a civilian attire?

2) Can improve on customer service by having a way for patients to update their residential / mailing addresses digitally or through SingPass instead of insisting patients make dedicated trips down to the hospital in person:

National University Hospital,2,"Went to the lumbar and spine clinic for a back pain which I suspected to be a bulging disc. Told the doctor all of my symptoms, saying its a pain that I've had for a long time and feels like it comes from a nerve instead of muscle. Doctor simply wrote it off as a back sprain, gave me physiotherapy and denied me an MRI, saying it was ""protocol"" and I had to come back in 3 months just to finally get the MRI. Not sure why but every time I brought up my back pain it was always dismissed as a sprain...   I even asked the doctor of the possibility of a disc injury and he said the x ray does not show any signs of it (a quick Google search immediately states that X rays can't detect disc damage) I insisted on an MRI as i had back sprains before and this one felt different but the doctor refused to give me an MRI at all.

Got tired of waiting and went to CGH because they were supposedly faster. First consultation there and they immediately gave me an MRI appt and suspected it was something more serious than a mere sprain. 2 months later after the MRI its confirmed to indeed be a bulging disc.

Baffled by this protocol of needing to wait 3 months just to be able to give their patient an MRI... Honestly I'm just gonna go CGH for future issues because these waiting times and lack of concern for their patients is awful.",2025-08-25T07:11:14.587Z,healthcare

National University Hospital,1,"Very bad overall. Warded on Saturday night and schedule for a knee operation which as they deem lower priority, I'm kept waiting indefinitely and fasting in 6 hours interval in case a slot opens up. Earlier this morning, they told me there were 5 patients in the queue before me, and no doubt newer emergency cases may also happen. It is now been 24 hours since I last ate and drank. After complaining about my gastric issue, the doctor allowed only tea and apple juice then restarting another 6 hours of fasting. Just after I finished the juice, they told me I could go into surgery. After rushing to the bathroom, they told me they made a mistake and I have to wait again since I drank something....

Is this not just horrible protocol, training management and scheduling or what? They just depriortise deemed ""minor"" cases all the time while not possessing the ineptitude to assess when a waiting surgery patient can eat in between observing the 6hr fasting.  One star for the staff in my ward who tried their best to comfort me and were so apologetic.

National University Hospital,3,"I am writing to bring to your attention an important accessibility concern regarding the use of lifts at your facility. During recent visits, it has become increasingly difficult for patients using wheelchairs to access the lifts due to crowding and the lack of prioritization for individuals with mobility challenges.

This situation not only causes significant inconvenience but can also pose safety risks and compromise the dignity of patients who rely on wheelchairs for mobility. I believe this could be greatly improved with the implementation of dedicated lifts for wheelchair users, or by assigning priority access during peak hours.

Creating a more inclusive and accessible environment would be a meaningful step towards ensuring equitable care for all patients.",2025-07-28T14:00:09.300Z,healthcare

Atlas Associates Clinic - GP Clinic in Singapore,1,"I had a visit with a GP.
After reading many positive reviews about the clinic, I chose this one. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a mistake!!!!!
The only positive thing was the very kind ladies at the reception.
It started with the fact that I had an appointment at 9:20, but I didn’t enter the doctor’s office until 9:45. Even though from 9:30, there were no other patients in the room or in the clinic—just me.
When I finally entered the office, the doctor, with an unfriendly expression (though perhaps that’s just his normal look), asked me what he could help me with. I explained that I’ve been treated for Hashimoto’s for 12 years, and for the past two weeks I’ve had symptoms indicating something is wrong with my thyroid – in other words, my dosage is likely too low. I asked for blood tests: TSH, Anti-TPO, Anti-Tg, FT3, and FT4.

First, the doctor sent me to the room next door for an EKG. He read the result as a heart arrhythmia and told me to go to the emergency room immediately, saying they would run the tests there. First of all, I’m a physiotherapist myself and I know how to read an EKG – and there was nothing alarming on it. Secondly, both of my parents are doctors. I sent them the result and they confirmed there was no arrhythmia, and that my symptoms as well as the EKG clearly point to hypothyroidism. This is basic knowledge that a GP should have. I also sent the result to my endocrinologist, and she literally laughed that a GP could make such a mistake in reading the result.

I do not recommend this clinic. I wasted half a day, didn’t take my thyroid medication, and didn’t eat breakfast – all because someone was incompetent and showed a dismissive attitude toward the patient. I should also mention that I was there with my 3-year-old son, and the doctor seemed shocked that I brought a child with me to the appointment. And one more thing – I find it unbelievable that someone would examine a patient through their shirt!

I absolutely do not recommend this clinic to anyone!!!!!!!",2025-04-07T01:29:38.091Z,healthcare

Singapore General Hospital,1,"There are rumours of this mysterious Pelvic Floor Disorder centre within SGH, but this has proven to be unverifiable.

My wife called the SGH hotline to enquire but the CS officer didn’t seem to know about this department. After checking around on her side, she finally connected my wife to that department.

BUT… nobody picked up. So the CS officer said that she will leave a message for somebody in that department to call my wife back.

BUT… it has been over two weeks and NOBODY has yet to call. They have also not bothered to reply to my wife’s follow-up email to them.

And no… I don’t think they will ever call or reply.

Clearly, the only option is to send my wife to a private clinic instead.

A person in dire need of medical treatment could have died many times over in these two weeks…

Have they been created to serve only a very select elite group and not mere commoners like us?

Why waste taxpayers’ money on a department that has no interest in helping those in need?

Throughout my stay, I felt that the medical team did not genuinely care about how I was feeling. Doctors would come by in the morning, say just a few words, and disappear—even when the situation felt urgent. It was disheartening.

Singapore General Hospital,1,"Absolutely horrible experience at SGH yesterday and Head & Neck center

I waited 4 hours for my appointment, from 9am to nearly 1.20pm, and watched every single patient who came after me get seen first. I was the only one left in the waiting area. When I asked the staff if a 3-hour wait was normal, I was just told, “Sometimes, because the doctor is busy.” At the 4-hour mark, I really couldn’t take it anymore.

I asked another staff member for help, and only then did they bring my appointment slip to a nurse and get a junior doctor to see me first. At this point I was holding back tears at that point I was so emotional and tired.

On top of that, their appointment booking and payment system is a mess. I had to personally go up to Level 1 just to get a queue number to book my CT scan, then go down to B1 to select a date. After that, I had to go back to the clinic to pass the appointment details. When I simply asked a nurse to confirm whether I needed to pay today (since I’m using Medisave), I got scoffed at, she literally said, “I told you already, right?” when I was just trying to double-check.

As i nurse myself I was being so patient despite the long wait and poor communication, but this experience was beyond frustrating. If I had known it would be this bad, I would’ve gone to NUH instead — or at least had lunch first. I just wanted to leave.

Dr asked what’s the name of med given to me in KKH in Oct 2024. Told her I was unsure however i can check in the app. Obviously I needed time to open hospital app to view the prescription that was given to me by KKH last Oct 2024, the signal in the room was not great, understandably needed awhile to load but it was definitely less than 5 mins. Could sense that doctor was impatient and didn’t want to wait. She proceed to open the records  in her computer instead which was so much faster.

The doctor in Room 8 was completely unprofessional and lacked basic empathy. If I had known he was on duty, I would’ve stayed home and opted for a teleconsult instead—ironically, the doctors online are far more professional.

The worst point was when he sarcastically asked me, 'So you want MC lah?' Why would I drag myself to the clinic while sick just for an MC? It’s beyond ridiculous, and I’m appalled that someone with such poor  manner is still practicing.

To anyone considering a visit: Call ahead to confirm if Dr. Denyse is available. Otherwise, you might end up with a doctor who clearly doesn’t care about your condition or well-being.",2025-04-14T07:56:36.525Z,healthcare

LifeLine Medical Centre,5,"Dr. Tan & Dr. Lee are VERY good GPs with great bedside manners.
Since moving to West Coast in 2008, i have seen them multiple times for various ailments and have never encountered any of the issues that some other people leaving negative reviews claim to have.

After reading some of the negative reviews, i felt it necessary to set the record straight.
Specifically to the posters who gave unjustified negative reviews (that reflect a greater problem with the poster than the clinic), i respond with the following :

1. Instead of having an entitled attitude thinking that the world owes you, maybe you should exercise some common sense and call the clinic to ascertain opening hours before going down like one would do with a restaurant or any other business;

2. A toilet is a toilet - why are you looking down on a more hygienic squatting pan design that doesnt touch your butt amd transfer bacteria to it?
Or are you so 'atas' that you look down on the way we Asians have been doing it for decades?
Maybe you would be more comfortable going back to your birth country since you have no hesitation in insulting Singapore's HDB toilet design history; and

3. Covid is NOT the same as influenza.  While it may present the same symptoms now, if you didnt have the RNA vaccinations that protect against the virus, and you got hit with the Alpha variant, you would likely be dead.  Kindly do not blame the clinic for your lack of understanding of medical protocols.

PanCare Medical,1,"Visited a week ago last Saturday for a UTI and was attended to by a doctor who said she wasn't the main doctor in the clinic. (Can't recall her name.) After doing a urine test, I was told I had only a mild infection and was prescribed just one single dosage of antibiotics.

I thought this was weird, because from what I read online, UTIs require a few days of antibiotics to be treated, but hey, I'm not a doctor, and we all know not to trust what we read online.

Although symptoms subsided after a day, they returned after a few days. I thought I could treat it at home by drinking lots of water to flush out the bacteria, but it only worsened.

Upon visiting the polyclinic today and doing another urine test, I was told I had a very high infection count and the doctor even wanted to send the urine sample for further analysis. This time I was prescribed a week's of antibiotics.

I couldn't help feel and think that I could've avoided the UTI progressing to a more serious stage (and thus a lot of frustration and discomfort) if I had been prescribed with adequate treatment during my first consultation at PanCare Medical Jurong East. The one single dosage of antibiotics also cost me $20, but it's more the issue with what I perceive as receiving inadequate medication to begin with that prompts me to leave this review, especially when I had trusted this clinic with my health after reading many positive reviews here.",2025-03-08T06:51:55.054Z,healthcare

The staff seemed eager to end the call without clarifying the new appointment time. Fortunately, I managed to stop and ask before she hung up. The interaction felt rushed, with no clear information provided, and no confirmation to ensure that I fully understood the new appointment date and time.

Also, the waiting time for a blood test with appointment still need to wait for more than an hour. Then, payment wait another 20 mins. Horrible wait time rather go polyclinics.",2025-01-17T01:06:41.889Z,healthcare

I dig my bag to get the necessary documents. Then this young receptionist girl who attended to me signalled to her partner, another chinese lady wearing spectacles, that i took quite a while to get my daughter's birt cert no. She think i never notice they were signalling to each other on why i took some time to get my daughter's birt cert number. They think we patients coming in are CLOWNS

Keat Hong Family Medicine Clinic,1,"If there’s a 0 stars option, I would’ve given it. Don’t even bother considering this clinic because of how unprofessional the doctor is. Specifically, Dr Raj Khammall.

I was having dry eye syndrome and politely requested the doctor for a referral letter to see a specialist. He responded by saying, “for what purpose? Dry eye?” with a frown and looked confused. I repeated by saying, “yes, I have dry eyes for 3 months already and I need a referral letter to see a specialist for my condition because the antibiotic that one of the doctor gave me at this clinic was ineffective.” Afterwards he told me in a frustrated tone, “specialist? This (Keat Hong Family Clinic) is a private clinic u know, u need to go to polyclinic to get a referral letter from them.” I told him that I had a referral letter from this clinic before previously. He then asked, “u got CHAS card?” I placed it on the table and he reacted by pushing the CHAS card back to me and said, “don’t give me, give the counter person.”

I just can’t believe a doctor would carry out his duties in such an unprofessional manner. I’ve never encountered such a horrible situation before at any clinics. I’ve also never seen this doctor before at this clinic so maybe he’s new? If yes, I would highly encourage the clinic to recommend him training courses for him to upskill himself or rather, get his character/behaviour right first in order to perform professionally at the workplace.

Can’t believe I spent $36 just for this horrible consultation experience. Made a feedback through email to the clinic and they reacted by saying that they’ll talk to the doctor only and even reminded me to not take any pictures. If u think about it, it’s a natural reaction from an individual when they’re treated in such an absurd way.",2023-11-28T23:41:58.096Z,healthcare

Family Doctors at 365,1,"Doctors there are fine and helpful. The WEAK LINKS are the nurses who are very slow and INFLEXIBLE, INSENSITIVE and INATTENTIVE to patients' needs. For cases of purchasing chronic medication, the nurses insisted that the patient must see the same doctor. No one else can purchase the medication on the patient's behalf. The nurses are only able to give half-ass replies but do not get things done, often leading to the patients getting exasperated. Very poor service.

Family Doctors at 365,5,Caring doctors - Dr Lee Pheng Soon is an especially optimistic and patient- centric doctor. He is highly encouraging and knows what to do for us.

Family Doctors at 365,1,"This clinic is a joke, would recommend to stay away. I've started my 3 dosage HPV vaccine with them.

On my second dose, the vaccine was out of stock islandwide and I had to take a delayed vaccine months later. Fair enough, this is out of their control, I have no complaints.

During my 2nd dose, the doctor explained to me that the delayed dose is not an issue as it was still within the effective period and advised that I take the 3rd dose early Nov - which he explained was X months from the 1st dose.

Early Nov, I called to schedule for a vaccine. The receptionist who took the call explained that they had trouble processing claims when another patient took her 2nd and 3rd dose within a duration too short. The receptionist then advised that I take the dose late Nov instead, which she mentioned was still within the effective period. This itself already raised red flags, it is as if the clinic was willing to risk the effectiveness of a patient's vaccination for the sake of their convenience in claims.

But since it was still within the effectiveness period, I was willing to postpone the jab, to approximately a month later than when the doctor had advised me to.

Fast forward to end Nov, when I contacted the clinic, another receptionist then informed me to take the jab in Jan instead, saying the 3rd dose should be taken 5 months after the 2nd dose.

All in all, the clinic had misinformed me, 3 different sets of information regarding when I should be taking my 3rd dose. I am very unconvinced by the professionalism of the clinic staffs. Just wanted to share my experience and hope no one else has to go through the same again.",2023-12-01T07:06:23.044Z,healthcare

Not only did she hurl my identification card TWICE, but she then proceeded to inform me that I wouldn't be seeing the doctor because, in her infinite wisdom, she couldn't find my medical histor card. Apparently, my illness was an inconvenience to her filing system and not having to pay cash to her was bad for her business? Since I was going to claim it under medical card.

West Point Clinic,5,"My family and I would like to extend our deepest thanks to Dr. Chuang Wei Ping for his exceptional care and attentiveness.

During my father’s visit on 30 April, Dr. Chuang picked up on something subtle and recommended an ECG, something my father hadn’t even thought necessary at the time.

That simple, precautionary step turned out to be life-changing. The ECG revealed clogged arteries, and even the hospital doctors later remarked how lucky it was we came in when we did—just in time to prevent what could have been a major heart attack.

We’re beyond grateful for Dr. Chuang’s sharp eye, medical intuition, and genuine concern.

Thank you, Dr. Chuang.",2025-07-22T12:02:56.144Z,healthcare

West Point Clinic,5,"I have known Dr Chuang since the time I was studying at NTU, which was about thirty years ago. When my wife struggled with a condition for many weeks, there wasn’t anyone else I trust more to help her. We drove all the way from Hougang to Jurong West.

I trust Dr Chuang because he goes about his profession with the same beliefs I hold dear to. I am trained to uncover the root cause as an engineer, before designing a solution. As an experienced HR practitioner, I do not prescribe approaches that address symptoms. One easy but wrong way is to throw training at an employee when the harder right is to give him or her the unpleasant but truthful feedback. Few want and dare to do what’s necessary to help others.

I once asked Dr Chuang why he chose to be a GP when he is a world renowned specialist. He told me he injured his hand and could no longer be a surgeon. He is different from many doctors so many will see him as unorthodox and think he’s wrong when he’s not.

My wife got the significant and sustained treatment we were looking for. Hope you have a clearer idea of how I see Dr Chuang now.",2025-06-08T23:45:53.432Z,healthcare

The level of comfort you provided me with throughout the session was truly exceptional.

Moreover, I appreciated how smoothly the appointment was run. Your team was organized, efficient, and ensured that everything was done in a timely manner. This made the entire process stress-free and enjoyable.

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the service I received from you and your team. I would highly recommend your practice to anyone in need of dental care. Thank you once again for your great work and dedication to helping your patients achieve and maintain healthy teeth.

Meridian Medical Centre,2,"Updated review after clinic’s detailed explanation:
This clinic doesn’t offer subsidised vaccination pricing as per MOH subsidised rate guidelines despite booking via MOH site, so it’s definitely pricier than normal. Based on clinic’s explanation, only selected clinics may offer subsidised vaccination, and some may charge consultation fees. Maximum price for flu vaccine per MOH guidelines is $70 (based on clinic’s explanation) and that was what was charged & paid. Do check before heading over as we’ve had to pay almost 2x the price compared to other clinic. Other clinic only charged my family member $38 btw.

MAJOR REGRET not checking.

Update after seeing Dr Tang’s reply:
We did show Green CHAS card to the staff, but was still told there’s no subsidy at all (only CHAS chronic card is entitled for discount) even though MOH and Vaccine.gov.sg states that with Green CHAS card will be $35. We also booked the flu vaccine appointment via MOH’s website click through, assuming it’ll direct us to clinics under the same pricing scheme but had a rude shock when a nearby clinic from home charged my other family member $38.15 while this clinic charged us $70. Not sure where the discrepancies are or if this clinic just doesn’t offer subsidised rates per MOH’s guidelines. Still unsatisfied as we did not get any clear explanation as to why there are price differences. The staff only mentioned “this is our clinic pricing, only CHAS chronic is entitled to staff discount”.",2025-02-12T07:27:26.713Z,healthcare

Pioneer Medical Centre,1,"I would like to raise a concern regarding my helper’s experience at your clinic this morning, 27 June 2025.

My helper arrived at the clinic at 7:40 AM, ahead of your opening time at 8:30 AM, in preparation for her scheduled medical checkup. However, once the clinic opened, she was rejected for the checkup and was told she would need to return on Sunday instead.

When my helper called to inform me, she was told the reason for the rejection was that the male doctor on duty could not perform a blood draw for her, and that a female doctor would only be available on Sunday. I found this explanation puzzling, so I called the clinic myself for clarification.

Despite my attempts to understand the situation, I was only told again that the male doctor cannot take her blood, with no valid explanation provided. I even asked whether the doctor was a trainee (which could explain certain limitations), but was told he was not. I also asked whether a nurse could perform the blood draw, and was informed that the clinic does not have a nurse.

I find this situation extremely frustrating. My helper waited nearly an hour outside the clinic, only to be turned away and asked to return two days later. This feels both inefficient and inconsiderate, especially since no prior notice was given about the limitations of your staff or service.

I would appreciate it if someone could explain why this happened, and more importantly, advise where I can escalate this feedback so that other patients do not face similar experiences in the future.

Thank you for your attention, and I hope to receive a proper explanation soon.",2025-06-27T01:04:11.310Z,healthcare

Pioneer Medical Centre,2,"My family and I have been visiting this clinic for years. We understand that the waiting time is long but we were ok with it, as long as we are able to get treated. The doctors are generally nice, patient and thorough when we consult them. The counter staff were ok in general. However, my recent experience in this clinic was disappointing. The counter staff was extremely rude and impatience. I politely asked a question about collection of medication (we waited for at least 20-30 mins already but still not called upon to collect) but received the following unpleasant responses:
- Wait... Can you wait? Wait for few minutes... Just wait...
- I am very busy. You just have to wait... Doctor still need to XXX
- Doctor, can you XXX, the patients are complaining already
We understand that the counter staff may be busy (by the way there are 2 counter staff). As patients/family members, we do not want to make things difficult for the staff. What we wanted from the counter staff was that our responses to be answered politely, and be respected. I sat inside the clinic and observed that this counter lady, for every question that patients asked, her responses would be very hostile and rude, and unpleasant. One patient claimed that he was asked to come down to the clinic at 10.30am, but this counter rudely responded ""No, I did not said that (x2)"". The patient left the clinic, probably feeling why he was treated that unpleasant way when he was already sick.

All in all, doctors are good, but the system in terms of registration and medication collection needs to be improved. What is more important is, the counter staff (working on 26 Dec morning), needs to work the way she responds to patients. If every patients that asked you a question and you need to be so reactive, defensive, hostile and rude, then the problem lies with herself. She is busy, the clinic is busy, but so are we.

This is my third time visiting this clinic. This is close to my home, so I come back here. Except for the doctor's diagnosis, everything else is very bad. The last two times I came, many people had to wait at least 2-3 hours to register. Even after seeing the doctor and waiting to get medicine, they had to wait at least 20-30 minutes. Alas, if you need to wait for a long time, you can inform the patient in advance. Today I came to see a doctor. There were only three people waiting, but I still waited for more than an hour before it was my turn to see a doctor. It's really ridiculously slow and a waste of time. Inefficient.

Despite having almost no waiting line or crowds, the patient service staff was downright terrible and disorganised. The staff members were disrespectful with questions and laughed at me when I asked them about the next counter to go to after receiving zero directions prior.

The doctor was kind and professional and made a great specialist referral. However, my referral was NOT submitted by their staff members and the clinic's hotline printed on the referral slip was not in service.

Not surprisingly, when I called NUH days after not seeing my appointment in Health Hub, I was informed by NUH that the referral appointment had not been submitted. This was completely unprofessional and spoke volumes about the low service and post-consultation standards of this clinic.

The NUH appointment hotline, on the other hand, was able to fix an appointment right over the phone to secure my appointment all within ten minutes.

SATA CommHealth Jurong Medical Centre,5,"I wanted to share two very different experiences I had during my visits to SATA. On my recent visit (29 Apr 2025) I was really impressed with how kind and professional Nurse Nur Fadhnah was. She kindly waited 5 minutes and told me to close my eyes and relax before taking another reading since my first reading was high.  It made me feel genuinely cared for.

However, during my first visit on 25 Feb 2025, I had a very different experience. I had a first high reading and despite telling the nurse that my arm was in pain, she proceeded to take another reading right away without waiting for 5 minutes.
I felt really angry and told her the high reading was due to the pain when the cuff inflate. The nurse cannot be bothered. In the end I was told to buy a cuff BP Monitor to record my readings for 5 days.
I hope all your other nurses will treat Fadhnah as their role model. Be patient and be more caring towards us. Do not work like a robot with no feelings.",2025-04-29T14:23:39.992Z,healthcare

Dr Seet and her assistant, Ms Yu Ling who attended to me were wonderful! Dr Seet addressed all my concerns regarding teeth stains and gum recession. She was proactive in asking questions about my brushing routine and gave me beneficial advice to follow. The cleaning session went great too—Dr Seet was very patient and careful during the process, I didn’t feel any much discomfort and there was no bleeding. Ms Yu Ling also made sure I was comfortable and had everything I needed. Since I was an existing patient, Dr Seet took the initiative and followed up on my previous dental records regarding wisdom tooth surgery. Appreciate the patience and attention to details!

Teehee Dental Works,1,"Dr. Seet Shi Ming displayed an alarming lack of professionalism and competence. Without even taking a 3D X-ray, she hastily and irresponsibly concluded that my molar that is sensitive to hot and cold needed a root canal. At that time, the tooth was not painful, and there was visible gum recession exposing part of the root. Any careful dentist would have conducted a thorough assessment, yet she skipped critical diagnostic steps.

I chose a conservative filling instead, but after the procedure, the tooth became even more sensitive. Rather than acknowledging any mistake, she confidently and repeatedly assured me that she could “fix” it by drilling through my existing crown, performing the root canal, and sealing the crown back in place. I trusted her and planned to proceed—only to be abruptly told later that their clinic could not perform the procedure at all and could only refer me to a specialist.

This kind of careless diagnosis, overpromising, and backtracking not only wastes patients’ time and money, but also risks causing unnecessary pain and damage. I would strongly caution anyone against visiting this clinic.

Teehee Dental Works,5,"i’ve been seeing dr kaydence chong for years now — from my pre-braces days, through a 4-year orthodontic journey (my case was more complex than average), and most recently, the removal of all my wisdom teeth. and across every single visit, one thing has remained constant: i feel completely safe in her care.

dr kaydence chong has a calm, reassuring presence, and she explains everything with such gentleness and clarity. even when i was nervous, i always felt like i was in the best hands. what makes her truly special isn’t just her skill — it’s how she remembers and genuinely cares. after moving clinics earlier this year, she personally kept her promise to reach out to me once she had settled in, and that meant the world to me. as someone with a deep phobia of dental visits, i genuinely look forward to seeing dr kaydence chong — because i trust only her with my teeth. she has always honoured that trust with warmth and professionalism.

i finally underwent the wisdom tooth surgery yesterday after i had been putting off for over a year — including a complex horizontal case — and what could have been a terrifying experience felt painless and smooth. dr chong and her wonderful assistant, elaine, made the entire procedure feel safe, comfortable, and even relaxing. throughout the surgery, they kept checking in on how i was feeling — and elaine gently patted me at moments, which really calmed my nerves. as someone who needs encouragement, their constant reassurance and care meant the world to me. that’s the kind of warm, supportive environment they created for me throughout the procedure yesterday.

dr kaydence chong once said in an interview: “the best makeup anyone can wear is a smile” — and i believe that’s exactly what she helps design: smiles built on trust, care, and patience. dr kaydence chong didn’t just fix my teeth — she helped me wear my smile with confidence.

words will never be enough to thank dr kaydence chong fully, but i’ll forever be grateful for her professionalism, patience, and tender loving care. thank you, dr kaydence chong, for being the only dentist i will always return to, no matter what stage of life i’m in. you’ve made a lasting difference in my life — and i truly couldn’t recommend you more highly.",2025-07-26T06:29:33.734Z,healthcare

I’ve always been confident in Dr Chong’s expertise and experience as a dentist. As a long-time patient of Dr Chong, I can attest to her qualities as a very meticulous, patient, gentle and skilled dentist. Before starting any procedure, Dr Chong will make the effort to explain any specifics as detailed as possible so that her patients know what to expect. Dr Chong also always assures her patients to let her know to pause/stop the ongoing procedure/treatment if/whenever any discomfort arises.

As someone who used to be afraid of visiting the dental as a child, being under the care of Dr Chong has allowed me to be more comfortable and at ease during my dental checkups with her.

Dr Chong has become my family’s trusted “to-go dentist” whenever we need to do our routine polishing and scaling treatments.

Teehee Dental Works,5,"😁 The Teehee Dental Experience – Smooth, Comfy & Kind of Awesome

Just had my teeth cleaned at Teehee Dental Clinic, and honestly—it was amazing. Everything felt seamless:

Got a friendly reminder with clear instructions before the big day

Checked in on an iPad with a soft-touch keyboard—nice touch

The ceiling has a TV, and there's a big projector showing live footage of your teeth (super cool!)

The place is clearly designed with real care—not just for patients, but for the dentists too. Audris, my oral health therapist, cleaned, polished, scaled—and even noticed my slightly misaligned bite (something nobody else ever did!). She gave me gentle breaks, constantly checked on how I was feeling, and I was happily distracted by Netflix playing above me.

The whole vibe: thoughtful. The service: top-notch. The icing on the cake? All this came in at $69 SGD for a scale & polish  .

If I could give more than five stars, I totally would. Huge recommendation for anyone looking for a comfortable, high-quality experience that doesn’t break the bank.",2025-07-08T15:47:40.464Z,healthcare
Teehee Dental Works,1,"I had a 1:10 pm appointment and arrived on time, checking in as instructed. A young dentist assistant brought me into the room and told me to wait for the doctor. I ended up sitting in front of a blank projector screen for a good 20 minutes before the doctor finally arrived — and mind you, the clinic closes at 2 pm.

I was scheduled for a scaling and polishing procedure, which was completed in just 15–20 minutes by Dr. Kaydence Chong. Not sure if it was meant to be that efficient or just rushed to finish up for the day.

The biggest issue was the lack of transparency in pricing. Their website states “starting from $69,” but I was charged $110. Overall it added up to around $180(with fluoride and consultation included) for this brief session. At no point was the cost explained or discussed — the entire process felt like a standard routine where you're expected to just go along without question or clarification.

Overall, it felt impersonal and transactional. Definitely won’t be returning.",2025-07-05T12:46:18.971Z,healthcare

However, my mum has been going to JMC for her regular checks for the past 5 years, and never once did the JMC doctors recommend for her to go for cataract op.

In addition, Dr Hao Lei said my mum's cataract cannot be delayed any longer, but he never folllow up to schedule any appointment for the op.

I attended to my 3 month long wait Endoscopy appointment with was refered by Ng Teng Fong General Hospital. I had a running nose yesterday which I told the guy who contacted me . This morning it started to cough. Actually I wanted to cancel off but when I thought of the 5 torturing days of preparation work for the scopy check . I just don't want to give up so easily. I want to get an opinion from the physican.

The lady staff after confirming my identity ask me is there any people bringing me back. I told her no. She say that because some guy after the check fainted on the road, so the physican are very strict on this. He might not want to do for me. I insisted I'm alone. Then she say that she will let the physican to decide.

After more then 40 minutes of waiting, the physican's nurse came to see me. Telling me the physican is not going to sedate me ask me is it ok. I told him whether can or cannot should me on the physican.

After he left, I started to think something unusual. I had an appointment with Ng Teng Fong General Hospital last year September with they rejected me base on my heart problem because  they need to give me sedation for my scopy check. I spend 6 months to look for a heart physican to justify my heart condition then they accepted me.

Now this guy say he can do without sedation. Then why can't Ng Teng Fong physican also do that without sedation. Instead of wasting  my 6 month finding a heart physican.

I'm not worry about nobody bringing me back I'm more worry on my cough but till now I still have no chance to see that physican.

More and more Singaporean like to live alone. Is already a trench. There are so my doctorate people in the centre and yet they can't think of a way to solve the problem. Instead of insisting someone to bring back the patient or goes without sedation.

Level 3, Clinic G, Dr Aziz Nather, Room 42. Rude, unprofessional, no signs of care or concern with a very stuck up attitude.

First, when I entered the room, no greeting. Just siting there with a ""like a boss"" position. Didn't even say ""Hello"" or  ask ""How can I help?"" Nothing. Just wait for me to talk.

See..
I've been having knee discomfort for past 6 months. Checks from polyclinic and Xray shows nothing wrong but it's been 6 months and everyday I will feel pain whenever I stand up, exert force, squat or run.

This doctor here did a 1 min check, same check as doctors in polyclinic when I hope that there can be a more extensive check like squatting, MRI or ultrasound. But he just feel a bit here and there, and I say no pain he say he can't do anything as there is nothing wrong.

I argued to say, what about my pain that I feel everyday? To which he says ""There is no cure to your pain. You have to do your normal activities and overcome the pain."" Whole consultation lasted less than 5 minutes.

What is this? I am here to find out the root cause of my pain and see what I can do about this. But this is the unprofessional thrash service that I am getting? For 5 mins consultation, I am charged $30+?

Unfortunately, they still couldn’t measure her blood pressure successfully with the latest technology. Ended up using the old device that all students use in school.

When it comes to measure her H&W, a staff assisted her to measure, afterwards another staff asked her to measure again. What’s funny that after i told the second staff that re-measure she push the blame at the first staff as “ didn’t told her that she already measured “. Look clearly at this communication within staffs…

Follow up, the doctor that assisted us, he gave me suggestions to choose between surgery or medication and ofc brainwashing me that surgery is a tougher way. Me being myself ofc ik that surgery might bring more pain to my 85 y/o grandma and I believe medication is best for her now. He randomly check her heart beat, type computer and gave us a paper to collect medicine.

Lastly, i asked him whether the previous medicines should still be used for my grandma and whether my grandma should stop ingesting those meds, he just gives me a unclear ans and ask me to proceed to collect meds at level 1… what a horrible experience in Singapore…",2024-02-26T03:23:18.288Z,healthcare

TWC Implant & Dental Center (Jurong East),5,"After researching for a while, I discovered TWC. Previously, I had done Invisalign and other dental care at a chain clinic with multiple outlets, but over time, long waits, inconsistent service, and unexpected charges left me frustrated and eventually made me stop visiting. (I also brought my elderly family members there for dentures, but unresolved issues and lack of support from the previous clinic’s dentist caused them to give up and continue using their broken dentures. :( )

I decided to try TWC after reading many positive reviews and was genuinely impressed. Dr. Lai and the nurses were patient and thorough throughout. I remade my retainer here; while the price is a bit higher, the quality and service are excellent. The retainer even comes with a warranty and lasted several months—unlike my previous one from another clinic that started breaking apart after just two weeks.

Overall, I highly recommend TWC to anyone seeking reliable and attentive dental care. I hope the clinic continues to maintain this high standard. Cheers!",2025-07-05T11:03:04.150Z,healthcare
TWC Implant & Dental Center (Jurong East),5,"Kudos to Dr. Lai and the TWC team for making dental visits comfortable and far from scary. Dr. Lai takes the time to ensure patients feel at ease, even encouraging them to raise their left hand if they experience any sensitivity during treatment—this simple gesture offers great reassurance. Helpful advice is also provided during the check-up, guiding patients on what to take care of afterward. The staff are equally patient and friendly, contributing to an overall pleasant and stress-free experience.",2025-07-05T03:47:26.101Z,healthcare

However, the front desk service leaves much to be desired. While waiting, I witnessed a very sick patient being ignored by the older assistant (as mentioned in other reviews too). She literally walked away while the patient pleaded for help — completely unprofessional and unacceptable behavior, especially in a healthcare setting.

After my consultation, I was told I could only get part of the prescribed medication due to a cap under company insurance. I was still paying partially, yet could only get meds for one issue (diarrhea), not the sore throat. I’ve never encountered a clinic that withholds necessary meds like this without a clear explanation.

This is my second visit, and both times I left with a poor impression due to the same staff member. Doctors here are great, but the front desk — particularly the older assistant — really needs to improve in professionalism and compassion. Disappointing.",2025-07-08T05:27:45.695Z,healthcare

Anyway, my family really appreciated his cheerful, encouraging disposition throughout the sombre admin process.

Martin Medical Centre(Woodlands)馬丁醫藥中心 மார்ட்டின் மருத்துவ மையம் Pusat Perubatan Martin 마틴 의료 센터 マーティン医療センタمركز مارتن الطبي,1,"Updated review on 21 April 2025 2035hrs.

Unprofessional clinic assistant. (Lady with thick & weird tatooed eyebrows). I came in at 8.35pm on 21 April 2025 and was told by the elderly clinic assistant that its closed. I told her it's not even close to 9pm yet. Plead my case coz i just got off from work. Then being told off by this thick eyebrowed clinic assistant on why did i came late, if she accept im the last patient she will go home late coz she also got family. Then came the worst part. Ask me if im under company clinic which i replied yes. She added some more you never pay, i still need to key in all the details for you and will cause her to go home late if she accept me as last patient. Im not sure if she knows every visit i still have to pay, the difference is being deducted via my payslip. What kind of stupid and unprofessional comment is this.

I smiled and then left, writing this review in another professional clinic. My family of 5 has been a regular at Dr Ben's clinic. Even my elderly mother in law that lives in Yishun came here for her calcium injection regularly despite paying a premium coz of Dr Ben. But because of one clinic assistant ignorant attitude, this will be the last and final visit from my whole family.

Unprofessional clinic assistant/ nurse. Not even close to closing time, when i left the clinic being rejected, it was 8.35pm. Don't need to give excuse company panel gives u more paperwork, that's your job. I will recommend my parkway panel insurance company to review the huge paperwork that you need to do. Infact, don't be a panel provider if you can't handle it. I appreciate you have a family and need family time but that's between you and ur employer. And my final advice to this lady is to smile.

Since the start of the year i've visited this clinic multiple times due to my kids illness, this lady facial expression leaves alot to be desired. Not friendly and leaves a bad fengshui to the clinic. Wishing you all the best Dr Ben and Martin. You lost my family services and those that i recommended will be duly notified. I guess im not the only person to comment on ur nurses, see screenshot.

Dr. Ben didn’t just treat my daughter; he truly cared!He listened attentively, conducted a thorough examination and took the time to explain everything clearly.He even recommended additional checks to ensure nothing was overlooked. What stood out most was his followup-he personally checked in multiple times to see how she was doing and to follow up on our hospital visit, showing genuine concern and encouragement throughout. This isn’t just a one-off experience; my cousin has had the same compassionate care from him. Dr. Ben is not only an exceptional doctor but also a truly kind and caring person.

I visited for scaling and polishing, and Doctor Chong was incredibly thorough and professional. I mentioned my sensitivity issue with cold water on my upper right tooth, and the doctor took the time to examine and diagnose the problem - gum recession caused by brushing too hard.

The doctor's advice to switch to a softer toothbrush was spot on, and the filling procedure for my 3 teeth was done with precision and care. I'm now sensitivity-free, and I'm so grateful for the doctor's expertise.

The assistance and receptionist were also super friendly and helpful, making the entire experience smooth and stress-free. Highly recommend Jurong Point Q&M for their excellent service and compassionate care!

Called up other nearby Jurong branches due to urgent review for my child and they were pleasant and showed patience in explaining that there were no child dentist at that moment. Suggested to contact JP branch and a robotic sounding receptionist picked up and repeated many times that they only takes in provided the child is able to sit through the session without crying etc (which I already told her I understand as my child is an existing Q&M patient). Explained the urgency of the matter and asked me which day am I looking at?! When I repeated myself that it is urgent and would it be possible for an urgent review on the same day, she said no and began raising her voice sounding like a broken record saying no walk in today. At that point I just decided to put down the call with the intention to write in this poor review requesting for your branch to do a review on your poor staff performance.",2025-03-25T08:30:30.532Z,healthcare

Q & M Dental Surgery (Jurong Point),1,"My mum was referred here for a root canal procedure, but she decided to do an extraction instead.

During the consultation, she was pressured by the dentist to continue with the root canal. (For some context, my mum is already in her 60s) After she insisted with the extraction, the dentist just gave a black face for the remainder for the session. Didn’t ask if the local anaesthesia had kicked in before the extraction, never ask how she was feeling during or after, never gave any pain killers, never uttered a single word since.

Not sure if it was because the procedure for extraction is $80++ and a root canal is $500++? Shouldn’t there be at least some basic empathy?

"Denticare – Choa Chu Kang (General Dental Treatments, Teeth Whitening, Dental Implants, Scaling & Polishing)",5,"I first visited Dr. Jeevan about 1.5 years ago for a wisdom tooth removal, and the experience was excellent - smooth and painless. So when I recently had a broken tooth, he was naturally the dentist I turned to.

Dr. Jeevan clearly explained my options and recommended a root canal followed by a crown. He referred me to an excellent root canal specialist - Dr. Gabriel at Royce Dental Raffles, who was also excellent and highly skilled throughout the root canal procedure. After that, Dr. Jeevan completed the crown work and, across other separate visits, also did my cleaning, polishing, and filling.

Each time, the treatment was quick, efficient, and comfortable. Dr. Jeevan is thorough in his explanations, which made me feel very assured throughout.

Overall, he has consistently provided great dental experiences and is definitely my go-to dentist. Highly recommended!",2025-08-16T03:28:29.795Z,healthcare

Dr. Huam was exceptionally gentle and reassuring, immediately putting me at ease. He performed a thorough checkup and explained my condition clearly, outlining all the necessary treatment options.

During the treatment, Dr. Huam handled everything with utmost care, constantly making sure I was never in discomfort. His attention to detail was remarkable—he ensured my teeth were perfectly aligned and felt comfortable before I left.

Q & M Dental Surgery,1,"Came in on a sunday because of a toothache, and wanted to have scaling and polishing done in the same day. During the process, was told i also needed 2 fillings.

Dr Koh did a very rushed job - with all the services i was out in 15minutes having been charged over 300 dollars. Very little was done to assuage the gum infection which was causing the toothache (eg unlike other dentists who will try to flush out the impacted area etc as i have experienced before). Had to remind him on this before he just went in with some polishing tool.

Overrall very patronising dentist, feels like this place is solely profit driven.",2025-06-22T06:45:21.282Z,healthcare

Dr. Joey Chen was a friendly and engaging dentist who ensured I was comfortable throughout the procedure. However, on 20/12/24, less than a month later, I noticed the filling started to feel loose, and using a flashlight, I could see a visible line. This was disappointing, as the previous filling on the same tooth lasted over two years before it came off due to a fall. I feel the recent filling may not have been done properly and hope that it can be rectified.",2024-12-25T04:56:55.770Z,healthcare
Q & M Dental Surgery,2,"First time visiting this clinic and also first time visiting Q&M in general for routine dental procedure (scaling and polishing). Left pretty disappointed due to the following reasons

- As a first-time patron of this clinic, I would have expected the dentist to spend more time to assess the condition of my teeth, since they have no prior records. Dentist went straight into the procedure without any assessment done.

- The scaling and polishing procedure took < 15 mins. The whole session feels extremely rushed and brief. This is despite me informing the dentist that my last scaling was > 1 year ago . All my prior experiences with other clinics usually take about 30mins at the least.

All in all, I left feeling disappointed and questionable on whether my teeth was checked properly, or even cleaned properly, which is exacerbated by the fact that clinic has such great google reviews. Not sure if this is common standard across this franchise or just my luck that the dentist that attended to me didnt seem too invested in the work. Will definitely have to reconsider whether I should come back again.",2024-12-05T09:43:59.205Z,healthcare

Trust Dental Surgery,5,"I have been to this clinic multiple times, for a variety of things (cleaning, toothaches / gumaches, retainer related reasons...) and each time I am always pleasantly surprised by the professionalism, skill, and warmth from all of the staff members. From the desk & administrative staff, to the dentists and assistants, all of the staff are amazing. In particular, Dr Natalie is incredibly meticulous and presents a level of attentiveness and care that reflects her passion and high expertise. I usually dread the biyearly cleaning sessions when it comes to the average dentist, however, Dr Natalie's assuring demeanour, constant check-ins and technical grasp provides a pain-free and fast experience. When she was making my retainers (which previously broke due to my bruxism / teeth grinding), she took put in time and effort, going above and beyond to specially tune my retainer to maximise my comfort and retainer lifespan (i think the lifespan of my retainer has almost tripled or more). She listens attentively and explains everything as needed and appropriate. I would believe that this standard of service is the ideal highest benchmark for all healthcare staff throughout all fields and specialities, albeit we must also acknowledge and respect the struggles and difficulties that come with being in the healthcare industry. Nonetheless, since my previous numerous experiences with doctors in multiple areas, I have had a generally bad impression and perception of doctors. However, she has shown me that there can be people who are passionate and skilled in their job, and the team at Trust Dental Surgery defies all my expectations to become the Dental Clinic that I will be sure to go back to every year.",2025-06-25T11:17:04.388Z,healthcare

mydental @ Taman Jurong,5,"A big big thank you to Dr Eow and staff for their patience and expertise throughout my entire braces journey.  The staff here are really friendly and it's a very comforting vibe everytime you enter the place.

Oh and you don't have to worry about forgetting your appointment dates as they'll send friendly reminders on WhatsApp which I thought was great. This makes it easy to contact them on any enquiries, and they're super responsive as well so you're in great hands.

Dr Eow's really swift and meticulous with her checks, and the whole clinic's really clean and hygienic while being cosy. Prior to coming to mydental@tamanjurong, I was quite apprehensive of coming to the dentist because I'd always thought it would be really difficult to have braces on teeth that had root canal treatment following a fall, but Dr Eow was up for the challenge and I'm so grateful for all her efforts over these few years. I'm glad to say that I'm finally able to bite an apple and chew with my teeth instead of cutting food into smaller pieces.  And yep, having a great smile now after correcting my overbite has been the icing on the cake!

So thank you all soo sooooo much! Oh, and if any of you reading this are still on the fence on whether to visit this clinic , I'll say give it a try, and I hope you'll enjoy your visit and be as pleased as I am with the service.

TLDR: Would I recommend this place? Absolutely 💯 Cosy place, friendly staff, swift expertise, what more could you ask? 😄",2025-08-19T06:31:15.864Z,healthcare
mydental @ Taman Jurong,5,"Had an excellent braces experience with Dr. Gaya, and I truly cannot express enough how grateful I am for her expertise, attention to detail, and gentle approach. From the very beginning, she made me feel at ease and patiently answered all my questions, always providing clear and professional advice.

What stood out most was her genuine care for my well-being. Rather than prolonging treatment unnecessarily, she always prioritised what was best for me, both medically and practically. It's very rare to find a dentist who balances professionalism with such sincerity and integrity.

If you’re considering braces, I highly recommend Dr. Gaya — you’ll be in safe, skilled hands. The pricing for metal braces is also very reasonable, making quality care accessible. Honestly, she’s the best dentist I’ve ever had!

The other staff at the clinic are also friendly and approachable, which adds to the overall comfortable experience. Booking an appointment was easy and hassle-free through WhatsApp, and their replies were always prompt and efficient.

This is on top of the 4K+ already spent at TSD, basically doubling my cash outlay to 8K+.

MY Clinic,1,"I only used this clinic because they were the only ones in my neighbourhood on my corporate insurance panel.  Pretty average standard level of expertise for GPs. The doctors there are friendly enough, although the clinic always looked messy.

I opted to use them for Healthier SG programme, after the lead GP sold me a very nice pitch. that was in Dec 2023.  I was also encouraged to email them, which i did. I sent an email on 2 Jan 2024, which went on to be unanswered for MONTHS.  Follow up emails and even phone calls were unanswered and when I finally managed to get through, it was already 19 July 2023.  All i got from the receptionist Lavina was ""did you?"" when I told her about the email.

So apparently no one checks the only email account of the clinic but Lavina. Either that, my email is not deemed important enough to open.  In the end, my treatment was kept in status quo and I didnt start my HSG programme till much later.

When queried, all i got was a very insincere ""As spoken on the phone on 20 July 2024, we have conveyed our apologies and we are again sorry to hear of the cost concerns with your specialist"", without the lead GP even acknowleging that his team messed up and dropped the ball on me. The fact that my emails and calls were unanswered for more than 7 months was the MAIN ISSUE, which the clinic didnt want to address. I am pretty sure if i hadnt called, it would have gone on to remain unanswered.

I was told in an email on 22 July 2024 that the delay was due to the clinic having to ""clarify a few things with ALPs and AIC as to the drugs eligible under HSG"". It must have been arduous, having to require more than 7 months.

I have since enrolled with another clinic for HSG. They are further away from my home, but at least the Physician there follows up on me regularly.  I feel very cared for by my new Physician, who clearly is invested in my welbeing.  I guess when you put patient's needs before monetary gains, this will happen.

Sometimes, it is better to just admit mistakes and not deny making them.",2024-09-08T05:00:28.202Z,healthcare

The Ming Clinic,5,"I’ve been going to the MING clinic for almost 24 years now. From my first visit to my latest the quality of care and professionalism has been exceptional. Dr. Tan who Recently retired was my primary physician who actually saved my life number of years ago when I developed a severe DVT in my left leg. Without his skill, attention, and personal care I wouldn’t be here to write this review. And Dr. Pang was also one of my physicians. Both of these gentlemen were and are two of the finest diagnosticians I have ever encountered anywhere in the world. Their skills, insight, compassion, and just plain, exceptional medical knowledge puts them head and shoulders above any physician group I have ever seen. Going forward I can only say if you were looking for the finest quality healthcare you start at the Ming Clinic. There is no finest anywhere in the world. And I would know, as I’ve owned and operated outpatient surgery clinics, and my wife is a surgeon. This clinic is the best you will find anywhere.",2025-06-02T08:53:17.272Z,healthcare

The staff is not only professional but also warm and kind, making every visit a positive experience. I’ve never felt rushed, and every detail of my care is always attended to.

AllSmiles Dental Care Plus,5,"Legit the best dental experience I’ve ever had in my entire life. For those who have a fear of the dentist, read on:

I have a childhood trauma of going to the dentist from primary school. Since then I only visit dentist when I really can’t tahan anymore. Doesn’t help that my wisdom tooth extractions years later was also very bad and traumatic (back then I screamed in the chair when I realized I could still feel pain as the dentist started pulling at my teeth - literal nightmare played out in real life).

But as I explained to the clinic my super fear of the dentist, they were very assuring and accommodating to my situation. They took special note of my situation, and right from the reception nurse at registration (sorry I didn’t get your name) to the doctor doing the procedure and even the assistant were very gentle and assuring to me. Doctor Russell explained every step of the way for me, what he will do, what I should expect and feel, and made sure to check that I didn’t feel anything before starting and even throughout the procedure. In no way did I feel intimidated by the procedure, throughout Dr Russell was very friendly and even joking with me to ease my anxiety. He was also very encouraging like I was a kid (not condescendingly or sarcastically, mind you) but you know what, it was actually what I needed to distract me from my fear and anxiety. Genuinely helped me.

Thank you Doctor Russell and the team for making me feel safe, comfortable and less fearful of the procedure! Would recommend for those who like me have a crippling fear of the dentist.",2025-08-12T14:17:50.587Z,healthcare

Health Check at Raffles Hospital,1,"1. Doctor issued false information repeatedly which would not have been corrected if I did not press the issue:

Appalling experience with a doctor who repeatedly denied the existence of a tripartite advisory regarding medical records and job applications even though this clinic supposedly processes hundreds of pre-employment check-ups every week. When I persisted in clarifying the issue, he became even ruder and more condescending instead of checking with his colleagues. Some of his choice words included, ""Well I am the doctor here, so I think I should know better.""

It turned out later that the advisory does exist. He did not even acknowledge his mistake, but instead continued to be even more rude.

2. Multiple potential breaches of confidentiality:
Afterwards, he also did not ask for my consent to have additional personnel present when another doctor walked in unannounced while we were discussion confidential matters about my medical history. Beyond that, he also instructed me to explain the situation myself to the admin staff outside, even though the clinic waiting room is a semi-public space and was packed full of members of the public at the time. (By the way I had to re-queue all over again for this)

3. Doctor has unprofessional behavior:
Doctor was rude and dismissive throughout our exchanges. Moreover, whenever I attempted to ask reasonable clarifying questions, he responded with clear impatience and disrespect.

Later, upon complaining about this incident to my close friends, one of them shared that their knew of this doctor personally and showed their publicly-viewable instagram profile to me. There they openly brand themselves as a doctor + lifestyle influencer and their content is mostly half-naked photos of themselves.  I think this pretty much sums up how much seriousness and respect they have for the medical profession and what they prioritize over being competent. I don't know what kind of reputation the hospital is trying to uphold with employees like this.

4. No response from Raffles Hospital

I sent several complaints to the hospital over 2 weeks ago and have not even gotten a simple response acknowledging that they have received my feedback and are looking into the matter. This is very disappointing as doctors should not be distributing medical misinformation and breach of confidentiality is a serious issue.

Because of this I have reached out to MOM, MOH, TAFEP, and will consider further actions. Reading the reviews here, it is clear that many people have had horrible experiences at this clinic for a long time. What kind of clinic has ""humiliating"" as a tag under its reviews..

5. Misc

I would like to add that the rest of the medical and admin staff were quite professional, and many were trying their best even though they were clearly tired and unhappy.

Although I don't stay in Hougang, this feels like a very warm and friendly clinic at the void deck of a Hougang block. Worth my 1.5h commute (back and forth)!

I visited this clinic on 19 May 2025 for diarrhea/stomach flu, and the experience was very disappointing. The consultation was brief, but I was shocked when the final bill came up to $150++, despite using my company medical panel.

The doctor prescribed 7 types of medicine, some of which were clearly unnecessary — like paracetamol, which I specifically said I didn’t need. The counter staff insisted I take it because the doctor had prescribed it, leaving me no choice.

Even worse, when I checked my claim later on the MyHealthWallet app, I saw that the doctor had listed symptoms I never had, just to justify the claim. When I called the clinic to clarify, the doctor stood by the false diagnosis and even asked me to come back to collect more medicine they “forgot” to give earlier.

If I had all the symptoms they claimed I had, I would’ve gone straight to A\&E. This feels like a blatant attempt to overcharge through the company insurance.",2025-05-19T16:36:32.918Z,healthcare

Dr Ben Medical @ Tanjong Pagar,5,"Whilst in a fairly sensitive and vulnerable position, I contacted this clinic after coming across them on Google. I heard back from Xin, the clinic assistant, within 30 minutes and had an appointment for 2 hours later.

The entire experience was friendly and supportive.

Upon arriving, the whole atmosphere was calm and inviting. The assistants were friendly and kind. I was seen promptly at the time of my appointment.

Dr Khoo was warm, approachable, professional and sensitive. She listened to me and gave favourable advice and treatment.

The consultation price was also completely reasonable.

I went away feeling supported and well-treated. This is the first time I have ever written a Google review because it was truly some of the best medical care and just generally service, I have ever experienced.",2025-02-12T04:53:18.841Z,healthcare

While you can receive the same medication and tests at other clinics, it's unlikely that you'll find the same level of service that Dr Ben provides. I'm unsure how he does it, perhaps driven by his passion, his sincerity and genuine care stood out. He doesn't rush into treatments and strives to make them as cost-effective as possible.

MyDoctor@Canberra,1,"Receptionist was so rude. Called in because the Fullerton app states “please call to ensure availability”. The conversation goes as follows:
Lady picks up call and says “hello?”
I asked kindly “hello, May I make an appointment for later tonight?”
She asked “what appointment?”
I replied “based on the Fullerton app, it is advised that I call in first to ensure availability”
She replied “we are not Fullerton we are my doctor”
I said “yes, it is showing my doctor in the Fullerton app. The app wrote please call to ensure availability, and I got your number via the Fullerton app”.
In a rude tone she said “we don’t make appointments we only have walk-ins.”
Well, if the first touch point is already so rude, I can’t bear to think what level of care they’ll give to their patients. There are plenty of clinics nearby who would show more empathy and service standards.",2025-07-08T06:53:40.984Z,healthcare

Went to the clinic to ask, and the reception shared they will ask the doctor.

5 mins later the reception shared they will push me to the next.

1035am, more than 1.5 hours later, another patient went in, and I am still seeing 3 patients ahead of me.

If you're visiting this clinic, please take note that 2 patients may still mean a more than 1.5 hours wait as they will insert patients into the queue ahead of you.",2025-04-12T02:37:48.721Z,healthcare

GP@JOO CHIAT CLINIC,5,"Kudos to GP@Joo Chiat Clinic. Have to Kudos first as I m afraid viewers will miss out this 'bouquet' and scroll passed the compliments.

Thank you Shu Yi my first point of contact and to Dr Jan, unexpected msg despite I actually retract the consultation.🙏🙏🙏🙏

Like all frantic family members of an unwell person at home, we urgently scrolled thru Google looking for housecall doctors which seemed not a lot esp if location is a consideration
Next I scrolled reviews which is important, Dr Jan's mention came in so very often, still I m very focussed on service..so location ok, 5 *..
I proceeded to call clinic, Shu Yi was the soft spoken, calm and courteous lady who took my call, went thru a short exchange and my queries were answered. She sent me a watsapp to fill in some details..
Still called her again to ascertain some issues..finally all done, forwarded the watsapp, booked the Doctor.
Then mum came up with some issues, thus family decided that we change course and will send mum to hosp.

That means I will have to withdraw the booking I had with GP@Joo Chiat.
Without hassle I was withdrawn from the booking as Shu Yi handled it with shere professionalism.
Especially the doc is so busy..Shu Yi with pure understanding and compassion, wish my mum well. Felt wow..such nice deposition in health care service👏👏👏👏

Went about booking ambulance, settling mum in and barely have time to see other msgs on hp.

Dr Jan from this clinic sent a warm msg :

Ms Isabelle. Dr Jan here. Hope your mum recovers quickly. Thank you for choosing us.

I was just overwhelmed by this msg..despite not even engaging their service.
(more warm msg which I m not sharing)

Such rare Gem like many of his patients reviewed. Thank you so much Dr Jan and team at GP@Joo Chiat.

I shall remember this clinic very well.

Still I read a review that was a little negative.

He is very polite, detailed and knowledgeable while being very particular tackling your illness whether it’s a concurrent or chronic illness.

When I sounded out my discomfort with drowsy medicine, he also walked me through which kind of medicine should be taken and when to take them.

He is also very honest to the price of the overall bill, ensuring the medicines are necessary before adding onto the bill.

GP@JOO CHIAT CLINIC,1,"Called in the morning to make a vaccination appointment that night 7pm. Staff said she would check with the doctor and get back but did not. I called again at 730pm to follow up. Staff said she would check with the doctor for any possible apptmt slots the next day and get back, but did not. I provided feedback to the clinic via WhatsApp that night, stating that if there were no available slots then appreciate if they can let me know so that I can enquire with other clinics. I believe my request was not unreasonable and is basic courtesy. Dr Jan replied personally,  saying that (1) he had “very little time” to read my feedback; and (2) they have a long waiting list and no vaccine stock. Dr Jan, in case it is not clear enough, the issue is the lack of follow up from your clinic on my request as promised - if there was no stock, you could have just informed me simply over the phone. I have patronised this clinic many times so this service lapse is very disappointing, not to mention the patronising reply from Dr Jan.

Edit - Your response does not make sense. I am entitled to give my feedback in public on your service, life threatening or otherwise. As per your logic, why don’t you ask other reviewers to take their good feedback private since it is not life threatening or emergency-related?  I have been balanced in my review. You have also not contested what happened. Kindly put yourself in the customer’s shoes. We do not know that you are understaffed, neither is it our fault that you are understaffed.

After a few more calls, GP@ Joo Chiat Clinic responded & requested us to provide personal details and patient’s symptoms. At that time, we did not know that Dr Jan Lin was on flight back to Singapore.

When he landed @ 8.45 pm, he messaged saying he will access dad’s medical record online first before coming at 10 pm. We appreciate Dr Jan going beyond the normal call of duty, in accepting this urgent house call when he is off duty and on holiday.

GP@JOO CHIAT CLINIC,5,"Long overdue review of Dr Jan and my experience at Joo Chiat GP.
As part of Healthier SG program, I had to appoint a GP Clinic but the ones nearer to my home are already full. This clinic is new and have vacancy for my enrolment.
Initial consultation was detailed to outline broad goals and I had to do some tests. After the tests we did the review.
Dr Jan was frank and open in his approach to get me to make active choices about my health. Some medication was issued but what impressed me of the whole experience was the level of care that Dr Jan and team have delivered.
I've since dropped 8 kg in 3 months, have less mobility concerns and feel more energetic/ alert.
I wished I got to know Dr Jan earlier as this is what all family doctors suppose to do; pre-emptive care and communications.

I was feeling unwell and initially just wanted to see if I can book an appointment soon (especially since I was only staying briefly in Singapore and I am not a resident). To my surprise, the receptionists told me I could do the consult right then, after waiting for my turn. They were very nice, so were the two doctors who saw me. I was consulted thoroughly, with care, and was given proper medicine. I'm not exaggerating when I'm saying that in approximately 15 minutes since walking in, I was registered, consulted, and leaving with all the needed medicine. I highly recommend this clinic and its empathetic doctors and personnel.",2025-08-25T05:56:38.462Z,healthcare
Life Vista Medical - GP Clinic,1,"Charged extra $5 because no medicine was needed — doesn’t feel right

Visited Life Vista Clinic for a mild head ache. The doctor did a proper consultation and charged the usual $35 consultation fee, which I was okay with.

But since no medication was needed, they added an extra $5 “admin fee” just for issuing an MC. I was told this charge applies only when no meds are given — which honestly makes no sense. It feels like you're being penalized for not buying medicine.

It’s disappointing and comes across as a quiet way to recover costs rather than transparent, patient-centered care. A clinic shouldn’t be incentivized to push meds just to avoid charging extra for basic documentation.

I hope they review this policy — it leaves a bad impression.",2025-06-18T05:13:33.842Z,healthcare

Vista Dental Surgery,5,"I’ve visited many dental clinics — from the popular to the expensive ones along Orchard , but none of them made me want to return as I felt all clinic is the same. This clinic, however, is truly different. I’m so thankful my family recommended it to me.

Dr. Andrew Chia is hands down the best dentist I’ve ever had. He was incredibly reassuring and promised the procedure would be painless — and he truly lived up to his word. I underwent two tooth surgeries, and I honestly didn’t even realize the extractions were done — that’s how gentle and skilled he is.

What really impressed me was the aftercare. The clinic’s service didn’t stop after the procedure. Jia Ling, the doctor’s assistant/receptionist, followed up with not one, but two calls just to check on how I was doing. That level of care and sincerity truly stood out to me and made me feel well taken care of.

I’m so glad I found this clinic. I’ll definitely be recommending it to all my family and friends.",2025-07-22T05:41:20.761Z,healthcare

Healthwerkz Medical Centre,3,"Bad attitude from Doctor Gerald Chong on Monday (8 May 2023).

I went down on Saturday (6 May) with the intentions to get the basic $5 health screening check up (from Health Hub app). When I went to the clinic, both staff at the counter said that they were temp staff and are unable to access the portal to check whether I am eligible for the $5 health screening check up. I proceeded to show my Health Hub message that confirmed that I am eligible. However, they said only weekday staff can access the portal and told me to come back on a weekday to check.

So the following Monday (8 May), I went down and the permanent staff already checked with the doctor and system that I am eligible for the test. I said I would return on Saturday to do the test instead since I would need to fast for the screening too.

However, the doctor on duty on Monday, Gerald Chong told me to come on a weekday instead because the temporary clinic staff on Saturday do not know how to submit the form for the health screening. He was rude and brushed me off and said there was no choice because the temp staff do not know the procedure and told me to go another clinic as he can’t help. I asked if he could get the permanent staff to help with the form beforehand on a weekday before I get the health screening on a Saturday. However, he continued to brush me off and repeatedly said that I should just go to another clinic instead before walking back into the room without hearing my response.

His condescending tone and words rubbed me in the wrong way, especially when other staff and I have been communicating in a cordial manner before that. Asking people to just go to another clinic instead also feels like an irresponsible act. I will not ever visit this clinic again if Gerald Chong is on duty. In contrast, Doctor Goh is a friendly and knowledgable doctor at this clinic every time he is on duty.

Additionally, I do not understand why the clinic is even open on Saturday if the temp staff present on weekends have no experience and are unable to submit forms or other procedures,

In general, this clinic also refuses patients before their official closing time. For instance, the opening hours are stated as 6-9pm but they would already start refusing patients when it’s only 8+pm and even when there are no patients inside waiting.",2023-05-13T03:12:23.560Z,healthcare

NuHealth Medical Centre,1,"DO NOT GO TO THIS CLINIC - Rude Doctor & Zero Knowledge
I visited this clinic today for a prescription refill of antihistamines to manage my chronic eczema. I was subjected to the WORST consultation of my life.

Doctor Tay Jun Sheng  shouted at me and aggressively questioned why I don’t just use steroid cream. When I explained that long-term steroid use since childhood has caused dependency (a well-documented risk), he dismissed my concerns and insisted, ""Your skin will never heal without steroids."" (This is medically inaccurate) – many eczema patients rely on non-steroidal strategies (like antihistamines and moisturizers) due to steroid complications.

His attitude was condescending, rude, and unprofessional. He showed zero understanding of eczema management beyond outdated steroid reliance, ignored my lived experience with the condition, and made me feel blamed for my own symptoms.

AVOID this clinic if:
- You expect doctors to listen to patients.
- You have complex/chronic conditions (Dr lack updated knowledge).
- You value basic respect and care.

Wasted time and money. Zero empathy, zero competence. only the receptionists are very friendly and respectful. Feel bad for them work under this kind of Doctor.",2025-07-20T05:09:09.851Z,healthcare

Husband was feeling so weak. I went and asked the doctor what will he be giving my husband. He took out this huge poster and said no antibiotics and flashed it at my face. Rude.

Consultation lasted 3 mins at most. Dr prescribed two different painkillers without ever asking about severity of pain. Didn't ask about medical history. No ""do this"" or ""avoid that"" or ""be more careful for x days"" or ""doing x might trigger this again"". Basically just ""I'll give you painkillers, bye.""

Personally been to this clinic at least 3 times. He listens to your symptoms matter of factly with little impression which I think is just his unique personality style. So no offence taken. But if you are someone who are sensitive, and needs TLC or soothing words then maybe, just maybe you might feel like you are at the wrong place. Honestly, if you work for many years seeing sad or even grumpy patients everyday, it is hard to feel excited or be all smiley (which sensitive patients can also take it the wrong way like why you so happy when im already so sad and in pain).

I like that DR gets to the root of the issue effectively and efficiently so that it will not take patients too much waiting time esp when theres a queue outside. Yes he does frown a little when I shared I cant swallow tablets and he made the necessary adjustments despite that. He does listen even though his face may not reveal that.

Quek And Me Dental Surgery (Choa Chu Kang),5,"I recently visited Dr. Quek at Quek and Me Dental Surgery due to sensitivity in my teeth whenever I consumed hot or cold food and drinks. I also had a chipped filling on one of my upper molars, which left a hole and caused occasional pain. Initially, I was advised to undergo a root canal procedure, which was scheduled for October 1.

However, during my visit to Dr. Quek, he took the time to assess the condition thoroughly and suggested that a crown would be a better option, as the damage hadn’t reached the root. He conducted an X-ray, explained the situation clearly, and proceeded with the crown preparation and placement of a temporary crown—all done painlessly and with great care. The entire process was smooth and comfortable.

Dr. Quek used a high-quality full ceramic crown, which he charged at a very reasonable price of $1600. He also redid the previous filling that had chipped off, and this time it was done excellently.

I truly appreciate Dr. Quek’s assurance, professionalism, and skill. The whole experience was quick, painless, and efficient. I’m very satisfied with the outcome and highly recommend Dr. Quek to anyone looking for quality dental care.",2025-05-28T08:17:10.371Z,healthcare

Had been experiencing irregular menstrual and was looking for a gynae doctor near me, and found this clinic online and decided to visit this clinic last year.

The specialist consultation cost $120++ while the GP consultation cost $90++, i thought it’s nothing too serious so i decided to see GP only instead. When consulting the lady GP, she asked a lot of questions and claim that i need to do a lot of tests which are pregnancy test, ultrasound scan, pap smear! The pap smear was the most painful experience i’ve ever had in my life! I was also bleeding and struggled in discomfort while the doctor still insist to collect the specimen, while it was actually nothing serious. I was disheartened by the pain and the unprofessionalism of the doctor. The pain was just indescribable during the pap smear process!

After a few days, i went back to the clinic to take the report and as per normal, they still need to extra charge for consultation to review the report.

I then went to another clinic to seek 2nd opinion on my issue, and the doctor was very surprised that why on earth that the doctor perform pap smear on me when in my condition, normal ultrascan is sufficient to know what’s wrong.

I had the worst experience ever in this clinic.",2024-02-19T02:38:49.052Z,healthcare

i.Dental - Dental Clinic in Yishun,1,"One receptionist's unprofessionalism is really no joke. When I booked for the second braces consultation one year after I deciced not to do it, she asked me why I want to do braces now after I decided not to proceed last year. This is a valid question, and I had my reasons which are super valid too. So, I answered. But she went on to say below things to me which I find very unprofessional and make the organization she is working for look SO BAD!
1) she said I must make sure that I want to do braces, then only she will book doctor consultation for me (excuse me, do I need to sign the paper that says I will do braces no matter what even before I go in for the consultation?)

2) ask me to imagine if every patient is like me who will book consultation but dont do braces later on. Told me that I am wasting doctor's time. (Excuse me! I am PAYING FOR MY CONSULATION. The doctor is not doing it for free.)

3) I said if you don't want to accept my booking, you don't have to. I will just go to another clinic which she replied to me that every doctor will tell you the same thing, and this problem (of me not doing braces after consultation and wasting doctor's time) will follow no matter which clinic I go.

4) (This is the worst part) She said their clinic isn't afraid to lose one customer. They can survive with one less customer.

I had the shock of my life after talking to her on phone. This is not how you should treat your customer. I am paying for all your services. No one deserves to be treated like a second class just because I cancelled an appointment in the past and didn't proceed to do the braces after consultation. Whether I do braces or not is ultimately my decision. Not hers.

Management should seriously look into this individual and have a word with her.",2025-04-17T23:59:38.961Z,healthcare

It will only take the doctor less than 2 min to remove the dental floss but instead I have waited for about 30min feeling the pain. There isn't any expression of sympathy and the response back was quite rude from one of the front service staff.

Very expensive and doesn’t worth it.
While previously I did scaling and polishing in KTPH dental clinic, only $70-80.

Booking appointment is easy too, admin is prompt with replies. Overall experience is excellent, highly recommend!",2025-08-25T07:20:52.762Z,healthcare
Nuffield Dental | Dentist @ Seletar,1,"I was a patient at Nuffield Dental Greenwich branch. The dentist who re-crown my incisor arranged an appointment for me at their Wheelock branch, ostensibly to choose a colour for my crown. When I went to Wheelock, the receptionist told me that no appointment has been made for me. As I was already there, I insisted to be attended to. A Malay/muslim lab technician came and we went through the selection. I chose a grade 3 but he brushed me aside and told me he will take a 3.5. I thought that he knew better and trusted him. During the session, I saw another Malay/Muslim man in another room laughing away. I dismissed it.

The dentist fixed the 3.5 crown and after some time, it sticks out like a sore thumb. I went back in July 2024 and insisted on changing it to 3. This time, the dentist brought the samples to the clinic. I chose the shade I had initially chosen- a 3.

On my return trip to fix a temporary crown, 2 chicken rice sellers at Greenwich foodcourt,  one male and the other female walked into the room. The male chicken rice seller stayed on to assist the dentist. I told them not to fixed a temporary crown that is too white as I have to wait another 14 days before I get the permanent crown. Instead they purposely fixed a temporary crown which was very very white. It is clear that the 2 of them was out to purposely to make a spectacle of me! At that time, the 2 chicken rice sellers were masked up and I thought that they were qualified nurses.

When I send them the photo of the female chicken rice seller, the dentist immediately told me that the permanent crown is ready. And I can go back immediately to fix it.

It was over the weekend and I delivered 2 letters of complaint to the receptionist who was actually the male chicken rice seller.

The Director of operations met me on Monday, 25 July 2024, and I insisted he sat in. The dentist fixed the permanent crown and told me that it was glued with temporary cement. And if the crown loosens to go back and he will glue with permanent cement.

This dentist is obviously lying to me. In fact he had glued the permanent crown with permanent cement.

After Nufflied’s refusal to settle the matter privately with me, I reported to the police and they investigated.

I had a dispute with the Malay/Muslims in my previous condo and that was the reason why I moved house to Yio Chue Kang. But for a professional dentist to collude with them to ridicule me is very very unprofessional and a serious breach of professional conduct.

I spent a total of about $3K including a splint. I will certainly lodge a complaint against the dentist.

The Receptionists also brings gossip into the office and breaches patient confidentiality.

The conduct of the clinic in allowing a chicken rice seller to assist a dentist is reprehensible and is a professional misconduct. I do not know the dentist nor any of the Muslim chicken  rice sellers at all.

I will certainly lodge a formal complaint to the medical council against the dentist, Dr Robin Zhang.

I have read their response and wish to add that there was no full and final settlement of the matter. I agree to accept the replaced crown as it is the colour shade I had chose but this doesn’t excuse Dr Robin Zhang and Nuffield’s  misconduct in allowing untrained personnel to pose as lab technician and nurse to assist Dr Zhang in the treatment room. Their intention is to make a joke and a spectacle out of me!

Now I recognised the female chicken rice stall holder- she is Lena who was the cleaner in my previous condo. She threw soiled tissue paper outside my opposite Arab neighbour unit which has caused serious disputes between my Arab neighbour and I. She also released a rat into my unit to force me to move out, not to mention threw dead birds into my patio/plastic and dead leaves into my patio in the days before I moved out. She and her lover (who was her supervisor) were asked to leave. She followed me here to take revenge.

I am surprised a dentist like Dr Zhang would see fit to further her personal vendetta.",2025-08-18T10:04:37.427Z,healthcare
Nuffield Dental | Dentist @ Seletar,5,"I was supposed to have an appointment with Bliss Dental at Hougang One, but a day before, I was informed the dentist went for reservist. This seems to be a common issue if you read their Google reviews (score 2.3 from 69 reviews).

I searched for a nearby dentist and found Nuffield Dental, which had excellent reviews (score 4.8 from 285 reviews). When Nuffield says your appointment is at 11 am, they mean it — no long waits. The lobby is spacious, clean, and doesn’t give that claustrophobic feeling. In the operating room, there’s even a TV on the ceiling playing an animal channel to help distract anxious patients.

Dr. Robin was extremely professional, unlike the “ya-ya ah-beng” dentist I encountered at Bliss Dental. Dr. Robin waited for the anesthesia to fully take effect before removing my tooth — I didn’t feel a thing. Nuffield Dental even sent me my X-ray photo directly, unlike Bliss Dental where I had to take a picture of the monitor with my phone despite having paid for it.

Highly recommended for their professionalism, comfort, and patient care.",2025-08-11T11:56:24.671Z,healthcare

Started contacting several 24hr house visit doctors. None picked up my calls except Dr Chua (see photo) 'The Mobile Doctor' thankfully. It was past 2300 hours. He was very patient and assessed my condition carefully. Despite my agony, his voice gave me a sense of calm as he went through my health condition step by step and gave his views on the current meds I was taking (for other health conditions) so as to narrow down what was wrong with me. As I had already taken different types of painkillers from Buscopan to Arcoxia to Cellebrex to relieve the pain, I was concerned with OD. I think he managed to pin point the cause and advised me accordingly over the phone on what further meds I can or cannot take to avoid overdosing. Upon taking his medical advice, my pain subsided significantly. I know there are good doctors out there but Dr Chua is one hellavu doctor.

Had ny filling done on my right tooth which had a huge hole which cause so much discomfort when eating and drinking.

Dr Lisa is so patient and very gentle. She answered all my queries on getting her advise of what to be done for my teeth and also answered my queries on the payment method for the procedure.

During procedure Dr Lisa make sure that my affected teeth and gums are fully numb to make sure that I wont be in pain during the process.. She checked on me for quite number of time to make sure I am ok before she proceed with procedure…

Lastly,I love the filling procedure that she did as she used a white filling rather than the normal black or greyish kind that was normally used by other dental making my teeth look normal again without  looking gross with those coloured patch on it.

Especially with the long hair lady who took my blood pressure. On both occasions she presented no interest in her work. She behaved like an automated machine, no smile, no passion, no warmth, ALWAYS SOOOO MOOOODY.  When collecting the medications, there was no dosing spoon for liquid medicine until I asked for it, the nurse simply passed me a cup & didn't bother to explain the spoon wasn't  available, hence, replaced with a cup. What's wrong with the clinic staff? The team does not have any basic customer service,  they are just not the right fit for the job!

Norwood Medical Clinic,1,"I have been frequenting Norwood Medical for about 6 years now. Experience with the receptionist is not great as mentioned by everyone else. However, Dr Neoh has been very helpful in treating us and prescribing us with effective medications. On 20 March, I registered myself at 11am to be seen by a locum doctor. After waiting for 45 mins, which is rather unusual, the doctor informs us that there is an emergency and they have to immediately close the clinic stranding all the patients that have been waiting. Understand that the particular patient was suspected to have a heart attack. Working in the healthcare industry, I can fully comprehend the urgency of the situation, however, i cannot understand why the clinic has to be closed immediately, ditching the other patients who have been already registered. My understanding is, the clinic should be activating the ambulance and wait for the paramedics to arrive. Thus, is there a need to IMMEDIATELY CLOSE the clinic? The patient was still fully conscious, was mobile and able to speak.

CC Tang Dental Surgery Pte Ltd,1,"recently visited this clinic for a dental cleaning and X-ray, and unfortunately, it was not a comfortable experience.
During the X-ray, I was asked to bite down on the sensor without any plastic covering — just bare rubber. This raised hygiene concerns for me, as I expected proper disposable barriers to be used between patients. The dentist and assistant also had no hairnets and they were cleaning my teeth with their hair directly above my mouth...
Additionally, the cleaning and polishing felt excessively rough and painful, unlike my experiences with other dentists. It was difficult to stay relaxed throughout the procedure.

Was told its gonna be slightly over $300 before I agreed and proceeded with the treatments then having asked to pay $630 over the counter and not been given a receipt for the breakdown of treatments after paying twice the initial amount.

CC Tang Dental Surgery Pte Ltd,5,"BEST DENTAL CLINIC IN WOODLANDS!!!

I just had a wisdom tooth surgery yesterday and it turned out way better than expected. Doctor was able to locate the source of my problem in the first visit and recommended the best approach to resolve the matter. Turns out it wasn't my wisdom tooth only causing the pain but the teeth in front of it. You can sense that the doctor has years in experience by knowing the problem in a matter of seconds.

Surgery turned out great with minimal discomfort. There was close to zero pain after the surgery. Aunty at the reception will be with you throughout your journey, from consultation to post-surgery. I was being taken care of very well. Which dental clinic checks in on you daily and send you reminders to take your prescribed medication and what to do? Only CC Tang Dental Surgery. A big thank you to both doctor and aunty for making this journey less scary and memorable.

PS: Appreciate both of your naggings on how to clean our teeth properly and visit the dentist yearly!!!",2024-02-25T06:52:24.012Z,healthcare
CC Tang Dental Surgery Pte Ltd,5,"I recently had an outstanding experience with the dental services provided, and I can't help but share my gratitude for the incredible care I received. My dentist is nothing short of a superhero – my very own Superman in the world of dental care! I just wished I found Dr Tang long time ago!!

From the moment I walked into the clinic, I was greeted with warmth and professionalism. Ms. Din (the assistant) contributed to creating a welcoming atmosphere, but it's my dentist who truly stole the show. His expertise and attention to detail were evident throughout the entire process.

What sets my dentist apart is, it's not just about the technical proficiency; it's the genuine care and concern for the patient that makes him stand out. He patiently explained every step of the procedure and answered all my questions, ensuring I felt informed and confident.

I wholeheartedly recommend this dental service to anyone in search of not just a dentist but a dental superhero. Thank you for making my experience truly exceptional. You are truly a gem in Woodlands Singapore :)",2024-01-22T10:25:03.330Z,healthcare

👍 Waiting and registration time is short
👍 Clinic is spacious
👍 Dr Wong is nice and let me understand how to apply the cream correctly. He took my temperature and blood pressure. I’m here just for my rash and state I just want this particular cream so didn’t expect he went extra mile to ensure no fever and BP is in range.

The only 👎 is the consultation is $40 which I find it quite high compared to some $20ish.

However, I could confidently say that it is the worse local clinic that I have visited. For many times, I reached the clinic at way before 4pm, and was only told upon entering the clinic by their staff that the registration had been closed and I had to come back for the evening session.

This afternoon again, yes, I reached at 3.50pm at their clinic. Saw the 'open' sign was still on the door, but again, I was told by the counter staff that the registeration was closed and I would need to come back in the evening.

From the doctor to the receptionist working at Lifeline Punggol Medical Clinic the are rude to their patients. After seeing doctor at the clinic, awhile later i was call to make payment & to clinic my medications. When the receptionist showed me the medicine's i realized that one of the medicine i got it at my home. So i told them i think i don't need this practical medicine as i have already got it. And the doctor came out from his room and told me ""If you know that you have this medicine, u could have told me earlier right, now my manpower has been wasted."" I replied to him saying that as as patient i only know that u are providing me with medicine. How will i know what medicine, how does the medicine even look like? This doctor is so ridiculous, his not professional for his work. My question here is, how will a patient know what medicine is the doctor going to provide? Until we are going to make the payment that's where we will look through the medications. How am i to tell him in advance that i dont need the medicine. And also i have went to so many clinics in Singapore, never once i have encountered a situation like this. No clinics have rejected our request when we tell them that we already have this medicine with us, so i dont need this now. All i know is they will take the medication from us and only charge us for the rest of the medicine they provide. Payment wise, this is not acceptable. I have ever paid consultation fee of $16 at other clinics. And their medicine will be strong & i will recover. This clinic here only knows how to charge us the consultation fee but their job wise they are not professionals. I realized that my comment is not the first, they are so some many people have encountered this at the clinic.

Luminous Dental (Yishun) - Invisalign & Dental Implants in Singapore,1,"Very disappointing and frustrating experience
During my first appointment with the clinic, I arrived 15 minutes early for my scheduled appointment at 730 pm, yet I was not attended to until 750 pm. It was informed that Dr Kayla's previous appointment had overrun.
When I made the appointment, I informed that I would like to do fillings, cleaning, and a consultation regarding braces. However, during the session, Dr Kayla focused mainly on recommending braces and only performed one filling, even though I had informed that other services would be required. When I asked if we could complete the second filling during this visit and I do not mind postponing the cleaning to next session, Dr Kayla stated there was not enough time, which was surprising to me. I have never been to a dentist appointment that only allows for one filling, especially when I make the appointment, I had already informed that I would need to do multiple services, and nothing was informed to me that this would not be possible. I also can’t help thinking that if her previous appointment overruns, she should not compromise my appointment.
After the first appointment, I scheduled a follow-up session for the second filling, cleaning and braces consultation. The receptionist confirmed with me again that I would be able to perform all these services in one session. In addition, to be able to schedule an appointment fast, I was recommended to schedule an afternoon session in which I did. I then took leave to come for my second appointment.
However, when I arrived for the second appointment, I was told that the appointment had not been booked. It was also informed that the clinic does not send text or whatsapp reminders and they only confirm appointments via phone calls. So, moving forward, if I miss their call, I won’t be able to verify that the appointment was made unless I call them every time before I go.
This entire experience left me feeling as though my time was not valued. It seems that only the dentist's time is considered important. I had to take time off work for an afternoon appointment, and this lack of organization and lack of respect for my time really caused unnecessary inconvenience. If you are looking for a clinic that values your time and provides efficient service, I would definitely not recommend this clinic.",2024-11-28T08:02:41.673Z,healthcare

Luminous Dental (Yishun) - Invisalign & Dental Implants in Singapore,5,"Has been seeing Dr Ryan for at least 4 years in NorthPoint! He’s so patient and meticulous that I introduced my whole family and friends here to see him too! Recently brought my mother (aged 64) for her teeth extractions after much persuasion (you know old people and how adamant they are, she finally budged bcos my sister is getting married and she need to have nice teeth and smile for the photo shoot).

It’s her first teeth extractions in almost 3 decades so she was nervous and slightly scared. Dr Ryan patiently explained to us her conditions (in both English and mandarin, this man knows 4 languages!) and we schedule for a follow up appointment to do the extractions. (All in one go, as requested by the mother)

On extraction day, Dr Ryan was very reassuring and calm down the mother. The extractions went extremely well and, so well that we did the teeth extraction at 10am and my mum is at her favorite Yakun drinking kopi at 4pm.

Feedback from the mother is she really like Dr Ryan, “he’s very patient, helpful and detailed”, “you know how sometimes going to see doctor / dentist is like seeing lawyer (every minute counts), but he takes his time to do slowly”, “if I know not so scary, I will have come earlier”

The nurses at luminous dental are also really good and they will call you a day after the extractions to follow up if you have any pain or problems so kudos to everyone who works there!

The only con that I will say is Dr Ryan is so popular that you need to book in advance for his weekend / evening slots. I have recommended to many friends and brought my family here and everyone end up adoring him!",2023-08-02T08:36:39.840Z,healthcare

Actually  doctor’s behaviour plays a critical role in a patient’s overall experience and recovery. When a doctor shows bad behaviour, such as being rude, impatient, dismissive, or careless, it can have serious negative effects on a patient.
Yes,, we are migrants workers but we are human not animal, we value our life, we lloves our life,doctor's care/Services should be equal for every patients, the patients could be black or white and local or forgoer.

Bcz of dontor's  behaviour  Patients may lose trust in the doctor and avoid sharing important health information, which can affect diagnosis and treatment.
Negative interactions can make patients feel anxious, disrespected, or scared, which can worsen their mental and physical condition.

Doctor's   behaviour is more crucial than medicine.
The lady really  not deserve  to be  a doctor .

This message to the management..
Plz identify them those who doesn’t know how to behave  with a patients otherwise display a big signage and write on the signage that migrants workers are not allowed to get treatment from here.",2025-07-18T06:53:24.290Z,healthcare

Note that sunday evening is a walk-in clinic, first come first serve, strongly recommend you come a few minutes before opening to ensure you get seen quickly. Came around 5.50pm, got seen within half an hour. Heard other patients that came around 6.20pm and have to wait 1-2hrs.

Kenneth Tan Medical Clinic,5,"On 9 May (Friday) evening, I went to the clinic nearby my home. Dr Jonathan Tan was very professional.

He listened with empathy and was aware that I am allergic or sensitive to many pain medications. He gave the antibiotics that I am used to take when I have bacterial infections.

This is the first time that I realized a private clinic can refer to my past medical histories in hospitals (SKH etc). I thought that I needed to go to polyclinic for the doctors to have easier reference of my past medical histories.

Actually, I prefer a female doctor as I feel very anxious when male doctors touch me, especially on the painful areas. Also, it's better for female Muslims like me to be examined by female doctors. However, Dr Jonathan Tan was gentle.

I had to see the doctor as I was really in pain and that was the nearest clinic nearby my house which was still open.

The staff at the reception area were also professional and kind. Just a feedback to notify the patient when is our turn, or a queue number will be better. (:",2025-05-10T10:02:02.927Z,healthcare

Kenneth Tan Medical Clinic,1,"Zero star if I could.

Dad went to see Kenneth Tan. My dad told Kenneth Tan that his throat feels like something stuck in it and has a little bit of phlegm WITHOUT any pain and that this has been ongoing for a few days.

Kenneth Tan prescribed only one medication - Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablets.

After my dad comes home, he said he was unsure why antibiotic was prescribed to him and so I called the clinic and spoke to Kenneth Tan to help him find out.

The moment I introduced myself, he proceeded to say my dad had a “sore throat”. This puzzled me as my dad clearly told him he doesn’t feel ANY PAIN.  Kenneth Tan’s tone immediately became louder and extremely defensive. He kept repeating “so what do you want me to do” “if you’re not happy you can return the medication” and “I’m not here to have a discussion with you”. We have no right to ask about the medication given is it? All I wanted to understand was why antibiotic was given. Additionally, Kenneth Tan confirmed he is UNSURE if my dad has any throat infection unless some test is done. So I continued to ask my original question  - why was antibiotic given then? He then said twice “ it is for bacteria infection in the throat”. Joke! So is there infection? Didn’t you say you cannot be sure without any tests to confirm? Wake up

Super arrogant and incompetent doctor. No more next time.",2025-02-03T11:22:39.210Z,healthcare

So I came over, registered, and saw Dr. Jonathan.

Well, Dr Jonathan was one of the, if not the most patient and friendly doctor I've ever met, my daughter started crying and doctor did almost everything  he could to distract and entertain her, making weird faces, sounds and almost everything else as he checked her breathing, tongue, skin and never once showed any signs of impatience or frustration when my daughter wasn't cooperative.

They might not have the medicine we needed which were suppositories but they have the standard oral cold and cough medicine, but doctor and the counter staff all took the time and effort in trying to ensure my daughter was alright.

That evening, my 1yo son suddenly developed a high fever of almost 40 degrees. I rushed back from work to bring him to this clinic, and he even vomited once on the way there. We reached there around 7pm which was near their closing time. It wasn't our first time visiting this clinic at such timing but this time, we were turned down as they were already having many patients in queue. As I was really worried for my son's condition, I desperately explained our situation and begged them to take us in, assuring that we will be fast. The nurse empathised with us and helped to check with Dr Ong. However, she turned us down on both tries, without even looking at my son's face or checking his temperature.
I understand that we were late and that she would definitely have to work overtime if she had agreed to see us. However, I just can't help but feel disappointed at her response. Anyway thanks to her, we found another doctor who was willing to see my son immediately after knowing about his high temperature. Thankfully it wasn't serious and he recovered a few days later.

Just want to share my experience. To be fair, my experience with Dr. Ong has been great before this incident and hence my rating.",2023-06-09T01:43:57.025Z,healthcare

57 Medical Clinic (Yishun),1,"I choose this clinic for my Healthier SG. I would like to express my dissatisfaction with the consultation and assessment conducted by Dr. Peter Goh. As a healthcare professional myself, I am familiar with the standard protocols for patient assessment, and I observed that several essential steps were not followed during our visit.

No vital signs were taken, no questions were asked regarding family medical history, and I was interrupted when attempting to share some information. Furthermore, medication was prescribed immediately, seemingly based on incomplete and random results, without a comprehensive evaluation.

I found this approach unprofessional and concerning, as it did not demonstrate the thoroughness and patient-centered care that should be expected in a clinical setting. Given this experience, we have chosen to transfer to another preferred clinic where we can be assured that standard medical protocols are followed.",2025-08-09T13:24:02.501Z,healthcare

On my last visit, I reckon the entire consultation was less than 5 minutes. I'm not sure what he's hearing with his stethoscope if he merely placing it on your body for less than a second before switching to another part. So on this unfortunate visit, I felt that the doctor was not interested to listen to your medical history leading up to the visit. I was sent away with Zyrtec (idk how many tabs I've finished at home before visiting the doctor), cough meds and some anti inflammation/phlegm meds. Semi lost my voice by the next day and my cough + runny nose got worse. Had to visit another clinic today only to be told I am having a sinus infection.

Also, it is runny nose, not running nose.

Sunbeam Medical Clinic,1,"While I appreciate the professionalism of the doctor, I am extremely disappointed by the way the clinic has rejected patients twice in a row within two consecutive days.

On the first day, I arrived at 11:00 AM, one full hour before the clinic’s stated closing time of 12:00 PM, only to be turned away despite being very unwell. The following day, I came back at 11:45 AM, when the clinic was supposed to be open until 1:00 PM, and once again, I was rejected.

As a neighborhood clinic, it should be expected that patient volume may increase, especially given the rise in COVID cases. COVID aside, if the clinic refuses to see patients until the posted closing time, then it is misleading and unacceptable. If the policy is to stop accepting patients well before closing, that should be clearly communicated—either on the website or through a prominent notice that registration closes at least an hour before closing time.

Being turned away twice after arriving well before closing is completely unacceptable, especially for those seeking urgent care. The nurses, who seemed eager to close the doors early, only added to the frustration. This is not how a healthcare facility should operate, especially in a community where it may be the only option for many.

After reading other reviews, it’s clear that this clinic has a reputation for rejecting seriously ill patients. I strongly urge you to reconsider your operational practices and address this issue immediately. Patients deserve better care and transparency.

Shame on you for treating the community this way.",2024-09-17T04:32:08.424Z,healthcare

I was totally not informed that my medisave will be deducted.  No  receipt and bill were given. Two days later I had a shock to find $70 plus deducted from my Medisave account by this clinic. (Then I realised what was the form I signed). In fact, the total charge was $100 plus for my case of simple food poisioning, part of this amount paid from my CHAS grant.

𝙸 actually lost my temper at Dr Liau Kah Han, quite a few years back, surprisingly he is very understanding. Wanted to thank him personally earlier as 𝙸 visited the clinic. But didn’t know how to expressed myself and 𝙸 do not want to take up his time seeing patient. So 𝙸 decided to write a review for him here to acknowledge his good ethics.
And Dr Susanna has been always one who reminded me about focusing on woman’s health in general, be it preventive measures for taking the jab for Cervical cancer a few years back and also doing pap-smear regularly when it is the due time.
Both of them are really good as 𝙸 have been seeing them for quite a few years already.
Just felt that this is what 𝙸 could do for them in allowing others to know and also acknowledged their professionalism and hardwork as a doctor!
Thank you Dr Liau and Dr Susanna.

My issue here is my feet is swelling and medication is running out and he dare to  ask if i want medication what kind of DR is this!  he dont bother to have eye contact and reason given was he is  checking the system. he continue looking at the monitor  till i have to say why are you not looking at me when im speaking. only then he started to have eye contact .he keep on saying to go back  to a&e despite i have shared xray dont and was ok. i feel he just brushing off patients i hope you guys avoid  HU GAN before you getting more sick and waste your money.   he also cannot write a letter for me after noticing my leg is swelling which is really unacceptable. and to the person replying this you may keep you standard format replying to public because doctor on duty does not empathy at all.,2025-07-14T10:52:40.297Z,healthcare

This makes the entire visit much quicker and more convenient.

I’ve seen Dr. Jared Yeh several times and highly recommend him. He is a detailed, experienced, and friendly doctor who always takes the time to answer my questions clearly and patiently. It’s reassuring to be treated by someone who listens attentively and explains things thoroughly.

Both me and mom had a good experience here, kind & friendly receptionist lady who did my registration for a basic eye checkup. Dr Lim did an excellent job asking background and what I wanted to check before proceeding with an eye check to test pressure, dryness, reading of alphabets and provided some advice for eye care. Also advised on further test, very transparent about cost and advised on further test based on what I mentioned initially.
He was calm, kind, precise & clear when giving instructions during the eye examination and apologised a few times as the bright light (looks like Sauron from lord of the rings) was shone into each eye.
Thank you for the kindness shown during the checks because it makes a huge difference so that anyone who hates going for checkups all to the clinic knows that it’s not so scary especially if you are someone who is extra sensitive with eyesight or senses.

No matter what problem we bring to him—big, small, or downright confusing—he handles it with care, patience, and professionalism. It’s so hard to find a doctor like that these days. His standard of care is unparalleled. From day one, he has consistently demonstrated a level of compassion and thoroughness that is hard to find. He listens attentively, takes the time to answer all of my questions, and always ensures I feel heard and understood. It is clear that he is also committed to our long term health and wellbeing.

Even after we moved to a different house, we still travel all the way back to his clinic because no other doctor will ever come close. Now we’re stuck with him for life because nobody else will ever match his level of dedication and kindness.

Absolutely rude doctor just like what the other reviews have said. Alan Chin was not even offering solutions to the problem and refused to even listen to the patient's point of view and immediately made his own spilt second diagnosis carelessly. Refused to give referral letters and treated the patient aggressively. Overall, not the type of dedicated doctor who wants to help improve quality of life for patients.

Tan & Nah Family Clinic,1,"My family, friends, and I have always trusted this clinic because of Dr Shawn’s consistently respectful and professional care. However, my recent experience with a locum (relief) doctor on Monday, 14 July 2025, as the final patient of the evening, was deeply disappointing and unprofessional.

As a 20-year-old female attending alone, I expected empathy and professionalism. Instead, I was met with a flippant, dismissive attitude. The doctor grinned, laughed, chuckled, and giggled throughout the consultation, as if my concerns were entertaining. I felt mocked and treated like a clown, not a patient. I doubt he would’ve acted this way if I had been accompanied by my parents.

I presented with throat irritation, phlegm, ticklish and runny nose, and fever (prior to paracetamol taken over the last 2 days), and more. I was repeatedly told it was “just a cold.” Whether or not medically true, the tone was belittling. I made it clear I’d been taking paracetamol for 2 days, yet he brushed off the fever history with “no fever now means no influenza,” ignoring that paracetamol masks symptoms. He even claimed “paracetamol isn’t to reduce fever”, and insisted it’s just to “make you feel better.” I was stunned to hear such misinformation from a licensed doctor.

I tried to share recent overseas travel to Thailand, but he showed no interest. No follow-up questions. When I asked what was being prescribed, he didn’t explain, just vaguely pointed to the counter and told me to ask the staff. This lack of clarity made me uncomfortable.

The throat check (shining light) lasted under 1 second. I have photos showing irritation and redness. When I raised concerns about my tonsils, he dismissed it saying, “I’ve seen thousands of tonsils, I know ok” He didn’t ask about my phlegm. I had to literally state that it was yellow and white, which was met with amusement again. (As of 15 July, brown phlegm is also observed, photo available)

Even more disturbing was how he mocked the fact that I had written my symptoms in my Notes app, something I do at every doctor’s visit to stay organised. He saw it and repeatedly made degrading remarks like, “You wrote so much, so you should know,” and “If you research so much, you should know a virus doesn’t just go away.” I clarified it was a personal log, yet he kept chuckling. It was condescending and appalling.

The consultation felt rushed and disrespectful. Yes, I was the last patient, but that doesn’t excuse the impatience, interruptions or mocking tone. He seemed eager to end the session quickly, offering no reassurance, explanation, or guidance.

After brushing everything off as “just a cold,” he used multiple pumps of hand sanitiser for himself but said nothing about what I should do. No mention of wearing a mask, isolating, distancing, or how long to take precautions. I live around vulnerable elderly. Basic advice should have been a given. His concern for his own hygiene stood in stark contrast to the lack of care shown toward a symptomatic patient.

This was, without exaggeration, the worst doctor experience I’ve had in any clinic, polyclinic, or hospital, local or overseas. It was worlds apart from the professionalism Dr Shawn consistently upholds. I left feeling humiliated, unheard, and uncertain about the quality of care I received.

Out of legal consideration, I will not name the doctor here, but I will share his name directly with Dr Shawn if requested.

I am not surprised to see that other patients such as, lin thant kant and vexel have both left bad Google reviews 2 weeks ago and 1 year ago respectively describing a poor experience with this locum doctor.

I will be making a formal complaint to the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) regarding the locum doctor’s poor conduct.

I will also be sharing my experience with all my friends and family so they are made aware of the standard of care.

This review is written honestly, in good faith, based on my experience. It is not to defame, but to raise awareness and protect future patients. Respect, communication, and professionalism should never be optional.",2025-07-15T11:47:30.484Z,healthcare

Noted other patients with missed queue gets called the number after the next (they were a lot of missed queues prior to me). When i followed up on my queue number, the doctor incorrectly pressed a queue number (eg no. 36) way ahead of mine (no. 26) (no. 35 was not called) and the receptionists giggled and joked that the doctor pressed the number incorrectly. I followed up again (I waited for about 6 queue numbers for my missed number to be recalled), and she raised her voice and said “I TELL DOCTOR MANY TIMES ALREADY”. I bluntly told her that the doctor pressed the wrong number, which she went silent and looked at me angrily.

Minmed Clinic (Punggol),1,"I visited this clinic early this year to see the doctor regarding a yeast infection. I explained clearly to the doctor that I did not have itchiness or burning, only sensation, as if something was there. The consultation itself was fine, but what happened afterwards left me very uncomfortable.

While I was waiting for my medication outside, I could hear the reception staff talking and laughing among themselves. There were three of them,  two girls and one guy and they were giggling in a way that made me feel mocked. I distinctly heard the guy say “help me can I ps leh,” which felt directed me. Immediately after, one of the girls laughed and said “no, you do it,” and the guy then proceeded to call out my name and explained the medicine loudly, saying: “If you feel ITCH down there you can apply the cream.”

This was extremely rude and unprofessional. First, I had already told the doctor that I did not have any itchiness, so his comment felt dismissive. More importantly, this is a private and sensitive medical issue, and it should have been handled discreetly. Instead, I felt like a clown being laughed at in front of others.

Medical visits should make patients feel safe, respected, and taken seriously. I hope the clinic can train staff to be more professional and discreet, especially when handling sensitive health matters.",2025-08-27T08:31:49.568Z,healthcare

3) After the blood test, which was HPV test, its a cervical check or something which may need the doctor to check the inner part of vagina, which need to use a tool to open up the vagina. The doctor asked my wife to ly down, head on the other side of the bed, then put the tool in, but cannot seems to work out, then the doctor ask my wife to ly down, in the opposite direction which was instructed to do so, then put the tool in to open the vagina, then half way or so, the doctor cannot really check or something, then stopped, and ask the assistant outside to come in just to hold the light for her. My thing is why is it that you can't just ask the assistant to come in at first! And why the doctor keep on finding all the tools and materials in the consultation room, and ask the assistant to find also? Where is the professionalism standard? How can the doctor make a patient like endure this kind os service standard? My wife wanted to complain but i hesitated as i think it's just our luck.
4) Today, which Sunday, 17/8/25, the clinic closed at 1pm, my wife collected her first faeces sample and prepared the kit, i drive down to the clinic at about 12.35pm, the male assistant from the clinic told me that they cannot collect as the collection team has already left. He told me that i may just call before coming down, i asked the assistant is it my wrong that i never call, and proceed down? He told me maybe it miscomm, which i totally dont agree!!! I told him too. On the very first day when we collected the FIT test kit, the clinic assisrant told us to bring down the 2 test kit, on 2 different days, during their opening hours!!! Which i did exactly what she said, and now, another clinic assistant told me the collection team left, and he cant do anything. So i have to dispose the kit, and re do and send it another day!

MINMED CLINIC, this is not the service standard we are expecting!!! All your staffs are changing here and there and this is the reason that you can use to protect yourself from our feedbacks??

I can't accept it and have to write this reviews. And i think this will need to go to the relevant department beause its government subsidies screening. And i dont want other to think that government subsidies screening lack of service standard, which caused by you all!!!!!",2025-08-17T05:40:14.416Z,healthcare
Minmed Clinic (Yishun Ring),1,"1) we booked through healthy screening websites which government subsidies us for the Cardiovascular, FIT, HPV test for just $5. We went down to the clinic punctually but the clinic assistant said we do not have any appointment, but nevertheless, they say they will proceed, but ask us to wait. The assistant told me that they cannot do the HPV test the same day as HPV test  need a female doctor, i told the clinic my wife wouldn't mind the male doctor as to check everything at one go, but they say the male doctor can't do, so, just do the cardiovascular test, which is drawing some blood samples, and passed us 2 packet of FIT test kit, to bring home to prepare and bring back the FIT TEST KIT, on 2 separate days after collect the faeces sample. So we book the next day appointment to come down for the HPV test with a female doctor.
2) The next day,  we came down to the clinic, and the blood test report came out and we can at the same time reviewed by the doctor. The female doctor told us that after seeing the blood test result, my wife need to take the cholesterol medication, which we already inform the doctor that previously my wife had already taken the medicine before, but the doctor told us its necessary to take another blood test to check the liver before to confirm taking the cholesterol medicine. And it will cost $30 for the check. As we think that maybe it's necessary, we agree with the female doctor and do the blood test! the blood test was taken at the back of the.hand, and after taking the blood sample, pulling out the needle, the doctor told us that maybe the blood samples taken out was not enough, may need to take somemore, which mean to poke 1 more time. I advise the doctor to just submit the taken blood samples for test first to see if it's enough or not, then the doctor agreed. ""I dont think this procedure is professional as my wife was a bit traumatised by the doctor saying of may be poking again to collect blood""

My child was clearly unwell, but instead of interacting with him and thoroughly assessing the situation, I felt like I had to guide the entire process. It was as though I was doing his job for him, which is unacceptable.

The consultation felt rushed and impersonal, as if every patient is treated the same regardless of their unique needs. To make matters worse, the clinic didn’t have the necessary medications in stock, so I had to go to a pharmacy afterward, making the whole visit feel like a waste of time and money.

I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone looking for attentive and professional care. It’s clear that this clinic prioritizes quantity over quality, and I’ll be avoiding it in the future.",2024-12-09T09:29:24.563Z,healthcare

Halley Medical Clinic,1,"I went to Halley Clinic at Hougang on 25 May. The doctor has apparently given me the wrong medicine for cough and sore throats. I was there for muscle aches and nausea.
When questioned, Dr xxx told me that was for his other patient.
Then he gave me another set of medicine which was meant for me.  This time, I was shock to see 2 packets of medicine for pain and fever (Panamol and Ibuprofen).  I was hesitating to take either one of these.  Finally I took panamol which is more familiar to me.

Once, my mom politely refuses to take and pay for the medication but was willing to pay for councelling as we have the exact same ones at home. The staff blatantly glare at her and told her that if she does not pay for the medication, she would not receive the MC. In the end, she had to waste an extra $20 for the medication. In addition, she had almost given us the wrong medication 😡.

Some of the doctors are excellent and treats the customers politely and with respect, but others take forever to diagnose one patient and gives lackluster analysis.

Halley Medical Clinic,1,"Dear Khay Mun,
I've read all the reviews and almost 99% are unfavourable ! Yet,  your standard reply is we are doing the best we can for our patients?!
I think it's you that are to be blamed for such sub standard or minus zero service rendered at this particular outlet.
I totally agreed with all the negative reviews cos I've frequent there myself. The counter staff are so listless( except 1 or 2).A particular malay staff looks so menacing like patients are the Problems! She never speaks a word and if looks could kill......She certainly takes the cake! How in the world can you ppl have such staff mending the counter.  A visiting sick patient will become totally SICK when met with such staff.
When I  asked to speak to a Supervisor I was told she is  not in. ( time: 1630hr ).
The negative comments about your counter staff dated as far as 4 yrs ago and it still persisted this very day!
Like I've mentioned, it's you that should be held accountable for such unpleasant visit by the patients/customers. Don't just paste and copy dispensing standard apologetic replies.
Get up your fat chair and go down and observe this outlet yourself posing as a customer and you will realise what we meant!
The service is Apalling or simply put it Non Existence !!
Shocking and Baffling !!

I first reached the clinic at 11am and the receptionist told me that I have to return at 2pm again even though the clinic opening hours mention that it closes at 12.30pm. I checked with the receptionist whether I could pre-register the appointment for 2pm later. The receptionist told me that I am unable to pre-register and that they only accept walk ins. I even clarified whether there is any cut off time to see last patient. She said she cannot answer because it depends on the crowd. I thought okay fine I’ll come down again on the same day in the afternoon after 2pm to see the doctor. This is when I got extremely pissed because I reached the clinic at 2.30pm and the receptionist just mentioned “Ma’am 6pm”. I clarified what she meant by that and she said I will need to come down at 6pm because it’s full. I’m baffled because it is only 2.30pm and the hours to see the doctor is till 4pm before they reopen at

As for the medical professional, Dr Jenny, Don't seem competent as well as at times condescending. She knew she was on the panel of clinic on Fullerton, and the only one around 5km radius at this area, hence she challenged if I am not happy I can go elsewhere or pay on my own. Very well done.

A female Malay doctor attended to him, and honestly, the service was atrocious. She was rude, arrogant, and seriously lacking in basic communication skills.

When he pointed out it was his right ear, she snapped at him and said, “You think I don’t know which is left or right? I’m the doctor, let me do my job.” Completely uncalled for. He was just trying to help by giving clear info — the way any patient would. No explanation was given on why she needed to check both ears. No breakdown of whether it was a blockage, infection, or even redness. Just straight to prescribing antibiotics like it was a checklist.

Coming from a nurse myself — where is your empathy? Where is your bedside manner? Did we skip the part of the Hippocratic Oath that talks about compassion and communication? Patients are not just numbers to rush through. They deserve clarity, respect, and a voice in their own care.

PLATINUM MEDICAL CENTRE PTE LTD,1,"Visited this clinic, hoping to have a straightforward blood test done for a health screening, but was incredibly disappointed by the experience. FIRSTLY, this wasn’t even my first time here, I came last week for the same blood test and despite poking my arm and wrist several times, they said my vein was too small and I was asked to come another day. (Which is today) AND TODAY, same shit again. What’s worst is, the doctor is the one doing the blood test for me. Isn’t this just a very BASIC procedure? If they AT LEAST apologised for it, I wouldn’t be so pissed off. But instead of apologising for it they were constantly citing various reasons like oh my vein were small, I didn’t drink enough water etc, does that mean everyone with small veins have to be poke countless times for a BASIC blood test?  If you’re looking for a clinic where even simple medical tests can be done, this is not the place to go.

I brought my 70 yr old aunt to the clinic for medical check-up for her LTVP and she had a chest x-ray done on 19 Dec 2024. A day later, the clinic called asking us to return as there were ""findings"" and said the doctor will explain further.

When we went back today, the clinic charged us another $65 for my aunt's 2nd chest x-ray but when I asked further, the male doctor was not able to provide any explanation at all, saying ""don't know"" and that the intention of the x-ray is to rule out TB. He then just asked us to refer to the medical memo which states there was transverse density observed and another chest x-ray is required for assessment.

United Health Family Clinic & Surgery,1,"The clinic assistants are very rude. I came here around 3pm and there were only 4 people in front of me. Both the women at reception never told me what is my Q number yet letting all patients before and after me in to the doctor room. I was still patiently waiting for my name to be called till only me and the other uncle (after me) left in the clinic around 4.20pm. This time I thought next is my turn. But then I thought wrong as they asked another new comer aunty in. Because of that I see then straight in their eyes yet they don't care. All for one and half hour I have been sitting in front of them and there is no way that they are not aware of me waiting for my turn. I got prolong and heavy menstrual flow and even the thick wing pad can't help my heavy bleeding. At this point I have no patient since I have an urgency already as my heavy bleeding due to fabroids killing me. Thus I asked them when is my turn and telling I already waited for over an hour. Then both of them see me like a ghost and telling me those they let in have appointments and they can't tell my turn. It's really rubbish and terrible. I asked again when is my turn and telling them it's emergency for me and I already waited for so long and if they have many people before me they should tell me before or after I registered into their journal. After repeating 3/4 times for same question they told me I'll be the next one. I am still waiting patiently till now and it's nearly 30 minutes again and now past 4.30pm.

Really terrible and painful experience with unprofessional clinic assistants at this clinic. They are not helpful for emergency people like me. I just need some pills to delay my menses before getting gynae appointment.

I will never come again this clinic from now on.

Just for a side note, morning I came by around 11.15am but they told me to come back later afternoon as it's going to close in 40 minutes.

It is so sad that Dr. Roy is subjected to numerous negative reviews online because of self-centered /self righteous Karen individuals. We wouldn't be at the clinic if my mother wasn't sick. Years ago, Dr Roy even saved my mum's life. She had chronic gall bladder stone issues. Luckily he checked and quickly sent her off to the hospital. Otherwise, she would have died that night. Yes, it was that serious. That day, even the other clinic nearby aka one doctor's front desk nurse rejected my mum as they were closing. 😶",2024-02-14T03:17:42.240Z,healthcare

Prohealth 24-Hour Medical Clinic,1,"I had a disappointing experience with a doctor regarding my 3-year-old daughter. She had visible mouth ulcers, and I suspected hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). Since it’s difficult to get her to open her mouth during consultations, I took a photo beforehand to show the doctor for better clarity.

However, when I tried to show him the picture, he refused to look at it, saying, “The patient is here, I can see for myself.” I asked if she had HFMD, and he immediately dismissed it, saying, “Parents like to scare themselves with HFMD.” When I asked if it was an ulcer on her tongue, he said no, but when I pressed further and asked for a diagnosis, he only replied, “Must be something else,” without giving any clear explanation. Despite this vague assessment, he still prescribed medication and issued a bill for $77.

The next day, my daughter’s condition worsened, and she refused to eat for two days straight. I brought her to another doctor and it turns out I was right. She did have HFMD and mouth ulcers. The second doctor confirmed the diagnosis and even told me to disregard the medication prescribed by the first doctor because it wasn’t appropriate. He also explained that HFMD can sometimes only present in the mouth, without showing on hands or feet.

I don’t mind waiting, and I don’t mind paying for proper medical care. But the least that should be done is to listen to our concerns and make a proper effort to diagnose a child. This is not just any patient, it’s a small child who can’t express their symptoms clearly.

If anything had happened to my daughter due to the missed diagnosis and dismissive attitude during that 2-minute consultation, the responsibility would have been on you. As a parent, I expect at the very minimum basic communication, attention, and care, especially when dealing with young children.",2025-08-04T23:52:18.229Z,healthcare

Prohealth 24-Hour Medical Clinic,4,"Enquired about the pricing for Influenza Vaccination for an elderly family member earlier today (15/02/25) at 1300hrs estimated. The staff over the phone mentioned that the cost is only $9 with a Pioneer Card, and that I can bring my family member down ANYTIME of the day.

Headed down with the elderly family member and had the jab at estimated 1820 hrs, the locum doctor gave the jab. Afterwards when we were due for payment, the staff member - a malay lady told us that the final bill is $40. We were confused and asked why the price was so high and not what was previously quoted with a pioneer card.

The lady then told us the time slot we have was under a locum doctor. Hence, the $9 offer could not be valid. In addition, she mentioned that she was not around to prevent the locum doctor from giving the jab as the offer would not be valid. The junior staff - a chinese lady was unsure about the protocols as to how the $9 offer goes about.

If so, why did the caller tell me that I could come ANYTIME.

Edit: Updated as of 17/02/25. My family member received a phone call from a staff by the name of Xris, who was helpful in refunding us the excess of $31 from the initial billing of $40.

Ang Mo Kio-Thye Hua Kwan Hospital,5,"This is a step down rehabilitative hospital and this review is given within that context. The hospital is quiet, great for rehabilitation. Was warded from 14th May to 23rd May.

Was warded in class 2B, 6 beds room with air-conditioning. Nurses were very attentive, caring, patient and helpful. Many serve with a cheerfulness that brightens up the stay. Many even make the effort to call patients by name, making effort to learn key phases in different dialects and languages to communicate with multi racial non English speaking patients. Nurses will take note of the amount of meals consumed and feedback to the dietician who will come to talk to the patient who is not eating and try to adjust the meals to suit them. There are too many nurses to remember their names and it is not fair to just name a few.
Thank you to all the nurses 🙏🙏🙏 in  Ward 3 West from bed 3316.

Another review had mentioned that personal belongings were recorded like ""in a prison"". It is a necessary process. Many patients are elderly and forgetful. They may not remember what they brought with them. One night I was woken up by the next patient looking for his phone & calling out to the nurses. Four, 4! nurses came to look on his person, bed and cabinet for it. I told them his daughter had brought it home to charge as they didn't bring the charger. That particular review didn't do any justice to the dedication of the staff.

Also big thanks to Dr Koh and Dr Er 🙏🙏🙏.
Many big thanks to physiotherapists Jason & Zilah and occupational therapists Samuel & Ros for their friendly, cheerful and helpful daily rehab sessions that allowed me to be discharged quickly 🙏🙏🙏.​

1. 1st day of check in to her single room ward, her belongings was taken into inventory checks and noted down (like going into prison). This was repeated throughout the day on the 1st day of check in.

2. All meals given was grossly tasteless and badly cooked. It was not just bad tasting, it was really vile but for survival and wound recovery, better supplement your own nutritious food from home for at least 1 meal.

3. Visitors allowed only from 12 pm to 8 pm sharp.

4. Physiotherapists were okay for my mother's recovery. Would give a 4/5.

5. Bed was too soft (it was sunk in and caused pain for my mother's operated hip), probably due to usage and not changed. For spinal issues patient, these kind of soft sunken bed would cause discomfort/pain.",2024-06-05T02:34:38.073Z,healthcare

Ang Mo Kio-Thye Hua Kwan Hospital,1,"My mum was injured by a nurse when she was in AMK hospital. A nurse literally ran her into a wall in the toilet. She let out a scream and the nurse said sorry. My mum did not think much of the incident as there was no immediate pain. A couple of days later, my mum's ankle was swollen and a doctor called me. I request for an update call but no one call me. I visit my mum later in the evening and request for a report. The staff nurse promised me a report in the next day which was a Friday as she was off on the same day. She claimed they will do a thorough investigation but no one interview my mum on the incident. Even the X-ray and dressing of the wound was done 8 hours after the report by the doctor.

On Friday, when I requested for the report, the Nursing Assistant Director said that some staff are not back from off and vacation.
I request a written report from the Service Quality Exec and he agreed. On the next Mon, I was inform that the report will be delayed to Wed afternoon. On Wed, I met with the Nursing Director Joanne, Operations Director Nicholas and Doctor Derrick. They claimed that they completed their investigations and none of their nurses remember any incidents regarding my mum. Also no written report will be provided to me. As her X-ray was ok, Nicholas said that the hospital was not responsible for her injury as no staff provided any injury report. For the fact, my mum can hardly stand and is a ""fall risk"" patient, must less kick out and injure herself. My mum also mentioned that when she was bathing herself most of the days, the nurses were playing their handphones rather than paying attention to her.

The lack of integrity and responsibility of the senior management is shocking. The repeated inabilities to meet their promises and their claim of non-responsibility speak for itself.

But I must commend the therapists Cherie and Brina for helping my mum with her therapy sessions. Their cheerful and friendly attitude and attention to details were the highlights of my mum's stay. Kudos to the 2 of them.

Focus Medical Centre,1,"If I could give a zero, I would do so.

Sprained my ankle, in pain and when the clinic finally opened at 1430pm, i was told to come back half an hour later. The other patients were told the same.

Half an hour later, we came back and told the receptionists that it’s 1500pm already. To my horror, the doctor did not even reached yet; what’s worse, the receptionists told us that if the doctor have not reached the clinic, patients weren’t allowed to wait inside the clinic. The receptionists said it’s their rule, in Mandarin.

One of the male patients flared up, and rebutted how could the clinic tell patients to come back and the patients were not able to receive treatment in time? The receptionists were not able to give a proper answer and satisfactory reply.

How is it okay if clinic opens at around 1430 but the doctors have not even reached their office? How is it okay if the sick and old are waiting outside the clinic to see the doctor? Is this professionalism? Is that what they are taught in Medicine School?

Never ever going to this clinic again.",2022-06-30T12:22:20.526Z,healthcare
Focus Medical Centre,5,"Despite knowing my son is ART+, Dr Lin is not stingy with her smile and showed her compassion and comfort my 5 yr-old child with physical touch. Then for this anxious mother, she gave her support by reassuring and giving professional advice. She even WhatsApp me what I can do to better protect my other family members after office hour!
We went in to see doctor at 4.50 and came out from the doctor’s room at 5.10 because she was so patient with all my questions as a novice in Covid. And you guess what? they should be closed by 5pm.

After seeing so many 1-star review, I would like to justify for the clinic with my own observations. This is my first time visiting this clinic, after being turned away by another overwhelmed clinic.
The front desk emphasized to me the estimated waiting time on the phone and requested me to register personally first. This sounds fair to me so I went.
So after the registration, the lady helped to estimate what time will be your turn, then ask you to come back nearer to the estimated timing. They even make the effort to call me when my turn is coming.
Therefore, the clinic looked empty as they did not let the patients wait in the clinic even though there is a long queue. This is especially good for the pioneer generation who stays nearby. Can minimize the risk by waiting at a clinic full of patients with various conditions.

I was asking because I needed her expertise, not because I already understood the problem. Instead of helping to explain, her response felt dismissive and made me feel unheard. If I already knew everything about my dad’s condition, I wouldn’t be asking a doctor.

Yio Chu Kang MRT Clinic,1,"This was my first and definitely last visit to this clinic. As echoed by most other reviews, I found Dr. Terence Koh to be unprofessional, dismissive, rude and lacking basic empathy.

I visited the clinic on 7 August shortly after moving to Yio Chu Kang and had one of the worst clinic experiences I’ve ever encountered. Upon entering the consultation room, the doctor asked about my condition. As I began explaining, he abruptly stopped me and asked for the queue number chip, which my husband was holding outside. When I mentioned that, he asked me why was it outside and requested that I leave the room to retrieve it — over a queue chip that could’ve easily been returned to the receptionist afterwards.

As I described my symptoms, including vomiting the night before and again that morning, he maintained a constant frown and asked when I had last experienced these issues. I shared that I had consulted a specialist in 2023 for suspected vertigo, though no resolution was found and this seems like a recurring problem. His response? A dismissive “You feel dizzy every day ah?” — a question that felt belittling rather than medically constructive.

The examination was equally questionable. He palpated my stomach and casually concluded, “No wind, can’t be” then asked me to follow his finger with my eyes. Afterwards, he remarked, “do you feel dizzy, no right?” — as if that alone could rule out my symptoms. Since when following a finger will make you dizzy?

There were no other patients at the clinic during my visit which, in hindsight, may say something. It’s hard to believe the few positive reviews here aren’t written by friends or family.

So please, if you’re searching for a neighbourhood clinic, look elsewhere.",2025-08-07T09:23:36.833Z,healthcare

MY FAMILY CLINIC (CHOA CHU KANG),5,"I’ve been visiting My Family Clinic, CCK  with my family for over 20 years & Dr. Yun has been an incredible GP throughout. He’s patient, listens carefully & always takes the time to make accurate diagnoses. What truly sets him apart is his dedication to follow-up care—he genuinely ensures we’re okay & on the right path to recovery.

The only downside is the long waiting time, but it’s understandable because Dr. Yun spends a lot of time with each patient to provide thorough check-ups & the best possible treatment. While waiting can be frustrating, it’s a small price to pay for such high-quality care.

Dr. Yun is a doctor who truly cares & he’s been a tremendous help during health crises for my family. If you’re looking for a GP who prioritises your well-being, I highly recommend My Family Clinic CCK.

MY FAMILY CLINIC (CHOA CHU KANG),1,"I had a disappointing experience with this clinic. Last month, we scheduled an appointment for 8.30am.

However, upon arriving punctually at 8.30am today, we were informed that individuals who came earlier—despite having later appointments scheduled at 9.30am etc—were prioritized, as the clinic operates on a first-come, first-served basis.

According to the administrative staff, our waiting time may exceed one hour. She is unsure of the exact timing.

This raises the question of why the clinic accepts appointment bookings if they ultimately follow a first-come, first-served approach.

Such a system is inefficient and unacceptable. I urge the clinic to refine its processes and give patients the quality service they deserve.",2025-01-26T01:35:52.945Z,healthcare

MY FAMILY CLINIC (CHOA CHU KANG),1,"I am extremely disappointed with the service at this clinic. We waited over 3 hours just to see the doctor, and when we finally did, my daughter was diagnosed with an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Despite that, the doctor prescribed her steroids, which raised concerns.

I called the clinic for an explanation, and I was told that the syrup was meant to open her airway and prevent asthma, and the inhaler was for asthma use over a few days. If that's the case, shouldn't the diagnosis have been asthma instead of a simple URTI? It feels like my daughter was misdiagnosed.

She’s a child, and it's incredibly worrying to have to guess when to stop using steroid medication without proper guidance. This level of carelessness is unacceptable. I will be reporting this to the Ministry of Health (MOH) and demanding further explanation.

It’s like your queue will be cut and pushed back even when you booked at 7am. I get that some elderly don’t know how to use the app but sure they can call or physically get a queue number according to whoever already got a number instead of cutting those who booked through the app. I dunno if I’m reasonable or logical right now. I’m just having a headache, booked the queue at around 7am but being cut queue cos physical queue takes priority. I just want to get this over and sleep, not look at the app all the time. Urge everyone to queue physically, den you can really rest. Why is there even a 117.1 number from initial 117? Is that how my queue doesn’t decrease?

After my appointment, the receptionist was also incredibly kind and helpful in assisting me with payment and booking my next visit. The waiting area I was in is also quite cozy (barely feels like a clinic!), even though I didn't wait long for my turn.

Admiralty Medical Centre (AdMC) Clinical Services,5,"I don't usually write reviews because who even reads them... right? ( I am a lazy person in general but this is the one time i actually feel like i just had to )

I had an appointment at the sports & medicine clinic for this knee pain that has been bugging me for quite some time now but was somewhat tolerable (about time i get it checked up), and whilst waiting for my queue number to get called, i was quite nerve-wrecked to be very honest as i did not really know what to expect - bad news or worse, a Doctor who could care less about me (i am just a socially awkward person).

But all that worry immediately vanished after i met a godsend otherwise known as Dr Teoh Chin Sim. Right from the get go, i knew i was in good hands, from the charismatic way she assessed my condition and potrayed herself, i was able to fully express the discomfort in my knee i was facing, and could feel that Dr Teoh was on the same page as i was. It was like explaining my knee pain to a friend who cared (Even sharing some similarities as I before have undergone surgery by person A from KTPH whom is actually the HOD of Dr Teo. It genuinely amused me to see how everything felt interconnected.)

At last, i learnt that i actually had a common injury called a Jumper's Knee, which was proven by an ultrasound that Dr Teoh had expertly done on my knee, showcasing to me along the way the differences between a healthy and unhealthy tendon, etc and the different treatment plans for it. Additionally i learnt that Admiralty Medical Centre is actually under KTPH.

Overall, i am really glad with how things went, I thought it was just gonna be another one of those consultation which does not tell me anything and feel like a waste of money.

The clinic itself is a rather typical neighbourhood clinic. No electronic queue system, so don't expect to walk away and wait for SMS notification. It can get quite crowded on Monday mornings, so come early or late to avoid the peak crowd.

The family clinic resides in the same unit as Thomson Women's Clinic.

They have different doctors on rotation, some of them being permanent doctors while others are temporary. If you have a specific doctor in mind to ask for, call them up before coming down.

When I returned to explain why 1 day off was not sufficient, the doctor brushed me off again, remarking that I “looked okay.” I had to emphasize that I know my own body and that rest is crucial in my line of work. Only after insisting did he reluctantly provide 2 days, while warning that “next time he will not.”

I found this interaction extremely unprofessional and lacking empathy. Instead of listening to my concerns as a patient, the doctor judged my appearance and challenged my request.

2. he told me to lift up my shirt and pull down my bottoms without a chaperone. i had to request for one and he replied with an attitude 'if you insist'.  i clearly had upper left abdominal pain near the ribs but he checked below my belly button and lower. fyi this is not the first time im seeing a doctor for the same issue so i am aware that his instructions were abnormal. i clearly stated that i was uncomfortable with his abnormal requests but him and the indian lady did not compromise and had me to follow their ridiculous instructions.

3.  arrogantly claimed 'no abdominal issues' and told me to 'get out' of the consultation room when i sat down after the examination. to which i asked if he needs me to return to the room later and he snarkily remarked 'i told you to get out already so consultation is over'.

4. the indian lady brought her supervisor to speak to me and the response i received was an unapologetic 'i will speak to the doctor' that's all. im sure this is not the first time something similar happened seeing their unsurprised, monotonous response. if you look up on this doctor, there will be similar reviews. and disgustingly, i learned that he is the main doctor of this branch.

Dear SIR

With all due respect, I would like to clarify a few matters. I was asked to remove my review, and I also noticed some inconsistencies that I hope you can address.

You mentioned that my company is not connected to your clinic. However, our company’s medical sheet continues to show Harmony Family Clinic as the designated clinic. Could you kindly explain why your clinic’s name still appears in our records despite this?

Even your clinic was recommended to me by one of my colleagues, who previously completed his medical examination there for his renewal..

I would appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Harmony Family Clinic,1,"I visited Dr. Sin today due to an itchy infection. When my name was called, I assumed it was my turn because I didn’t see any other female patients around at the time. However, it turned out that there was another patient with a very similar name to mine. Unfortunately, Dr. Sin did not confirm my full name when I entered the consultation room, and it wasn’t until after the check-up that the mix-up was noticed.

This situation could have been avoided with a more accurate system for calling patients. I would recommend suggest implementing a number-calling system displayed on a screen or wall to reduce confusion, especially when patients have similar names. Additionally, I noticed that Dr. Sin's voice was quite loud even though I was standing nearby went she came out to say that i m not the patient she called! This came across as abrupt and could be toned down in future.

Lastly, I would like to commend the clinic staff. Despite my unpleasant experience with the consultation, one of the staff members kindly explained the situation and even apologized on Dr. Sin’s behalf, which I truly appreciated.

Thank you for taking this feedback into consideration to improve future experiences for all patients.",2025-06-11T02:10:55.140Z,healthcare

However despite all the collective medical knowledge in Yishun Community Hospital, they placed my elderly mother with a bedrock of existing medical conditions, fighting dengue, in between patients who are coughing all night and one even complained of chest pains (which my mom overheard). Beds were near to each other (similar to nursing homes) and there were 40 beds in that observation ward (EDTU). About half the beds were occupied, so loads of space and free area.

I known him 30 years ago and all along if I can think of a caring doctor will be him. Sadly things have changed for this clinic. Yes, the ladies at the counter is rather rude and act as if they are the boss.  The fact that the numbers run out just 30 mins into opening is probably because of Dr Chui being patience for his clients but at the same time, he always reach the clinic more than 30mins after the supposed clinic operating hour. This time round I went to see Dr Chui for my usual medication,  and  there is a need to do blood test. I just pondered for a moment whether to do it, he replied ""you can go look for other doctor"". Was quite stunned and didn't expect this from him actually. Overall the clinic experience has deteriorated.  Not sure what has happened to Dr Chui, I hope the old spirit and his caring attitude can return. As for the ladies at the counter, please be more understanding with your patient and stop being so arrogant and complacent. If you are having fever or need urgent medical treatment,  this is not the clinic to go.",2024-11-20T18:43:52.853Z,healthcare
Evercare Medical Clinic,1,"I had been a patient with this clinic for almost 30 years. I had decided to quit for good. It seems like the clinic is being run by the ladies at the counter and not by the doctor.

I reached clinic for my blood test and medication at 9.30 and was told to come back about 12 pm. I asked the lady if it was possible to bring forward my blood test as I had been fasting since 8 pm. last night. The lady turned me down right away.

I then decided to just get my diabetic  medication for another month and come back again for my blood test. Without even consulting the doctor, the lady just told me No.

Many times, I had seen patients coming into the clinic at about 10 am. The counter staff just informed the patient that there was no more Q number and to come back 2pm for the afternoon Q. The patient requested an afternoon Q number but was rejected right away. I do understand that the clinic is popular and business is very good. Why make life so difficult for patients.

I believe I am not the only patient who feels this frustration. I am so disappointed this clinic with such a passionate doctor is being ruined by the counter staff.

Nevertheless, thanks to Dr Chui Peng Leong for his care over these 30 years. My best wishes to him.",2024-11-05T03:08:57.925Z,healthcare

Effectively destroying the family efforts through the years for her recovery.

Patient when back to for follow up due to worsening condition and then was told the shocking news above which destroyed her emotion completely.

The doctor level of inconsideration was on a professional level knowing what is best for the patient assuming that he knows best even thou patient keep emphasising that she cannot take anything with steroid. The doctor wasn’t a bit apologetic at all and said that he will prescribed antibiotic cream WITHOUT steroids this time round after dealing damage to the patient with antibiotic cream with steroids.

Most importantly, Dr Lim was extremely patient and caring.  Unlike my experience with other GPs who sends me out the door in mins without a detail diagnosis.

I visited this clinic for a headache consultation, expecting the fee to be around $45 as initially stated. However, upon arrival, I was informed that the consultation alone would cost $68.

In addition, the staff came across as unfriendly and unapproachable, which made the experience even more frustrating. Overall, I found the visit to be disappointing and would not recommend this clinic to others.

It was my first visit to this clinic, and the experience opened up a whole new world for me. I’ve been to many dental clinics over the years, but this is the first and only one where I felt completely safe and comforted in their hands.

Around 6pm, I was suddenly hit with a terrible dull toothache. I reached out to my usual nearby clinics, but none could take me and all pushed me to the next working day. The pain was unbearable, and I knew I couldn’t wait.

My husband kept trying other clinics, and this was the only one that agreed to see me—even though they were fully booked. They asked me to come in at 8:30pm, just 30 minutes before closing time, and I rushed down in 20 minutes.

When I arrived, the counter staff warmly received me and kindly explained that I might need to wait. I truly didn’t mind—I was just so thankful they accepted me last minute.

During the wait, I saw how committed and busy the team was. Even late into the night, they were attending to patients with care and professionalism.

It was clear - Patients are their top priority.

When it was finally my turn, the dentist apologised for the wait and still gave me her full attention and care—even though it was way past her working hours. That left a deep impression on me.

The service here is top-notch, and the compassion and dedication of the team are beyond words. Thank you for going above and beyond for your patients. I’m so glad I found this clinic.

Q & M Dental Surgery (Marsiling),5,"Background: I have always been terrified of visiting the dentist, so much so that my teeth are in terrible condition and I still refuse to see one.

That is until I met Dr Stephen Khor. Through the extremely positive reviews here and a huge push from my loved ones, I took the plunge to see him. It was the most terrifying and yet best decision of my life.

Dr Khor is very patient to explain the situation regarding my teeth, informing me what he is going to do to help me and things to take note of. He is very mindful of the fact that I'm afraid of the dentist, giving me assurance and managing my pain and fears well. He is gentle and extremely professional, guiding through the procedure.

So far I've been for my second visit. Many more visits to go to repair all the damage from all these years of fear and neglect. But I know I'm in very good hands. Thank you so much Dr Khor. Just wish I knew of you earlier.",2024-08-24T07:42:22.842Z,healthcare

Family Dental Centre Victoria Rivervale,1,"Terrible experience at Rivervale mall FDC family dental center!

Brought my young son here for his first dental visit and it was a terrible experience. The clinic had called me earlier today to move my appointment earlier, and I agreed. During the consultation, when the dentist asked my son if he wanted to extract his tooth or not — in a blunt, impatient tone — saying you want to do or not! he then added that we were already “late,” despite the clinic being the one who had moved the appointment and we were on time.

From the start, his manner was unfriendly and dismissive. He used a snide, sarcastic tone, completely inappropriate statements and improper annotations to say to a parent in front of a child. Instead of explaining the procedure, offering reassurance, or coaxing a child (as any competent children’s dentist should), he made him feel pressured and frightened. I was so appalled I decided to walk out halfway through the consultation.

Such behaviour is unethical, unprofessional, and unacceptable, especially for someone working with children. While you continue practising dentistry, may I suggest you also practise your manners as a professional. Such lousy service should never be tolerated. Parents and children deserve kindness, respect, and proper care, not rudeness and indifference. I hope no parents nor any patients patronising will ever have to experience this!
Such Horrendous act should not be tolerated.",2025-08-15T09:47:06.750Z,healthcare

Family Dental Centre Victoria Rivervale,5,"I travel halfway across Singapore by bus to FDC Rivervale each time because it is worth it. You know it is not easy to find a good dentist, let alone a great one.

For someone who had been living with an irrational fear of dentists for too many years, Dr. John is a God-send for super squeamish people like me. I've gone through some pretty major work with him (wisdom tooth, implants), and each time I am a little less scared and more confident of sitting in the chair.

He's considerate, skillful, and I 10/10 will recommend him to anyone who has been silly enough like me to avoid dentists. If that's you, I feel you, and I'm telling you from experience that it's gonna be more than OK.

Kudos to everyone in the team and management. The positive atmosphere at FDC Rivervale is palpable - upbeat, positive, efficient, and most importantly, caring.",2025-07-25T04:53:33.575Z,healthcare

SATA CommHealth Woodlands Medical Centre,1,"护士都很好、很友善，可是有位女医生的态度让我很无语。

我是来做 work pass renew 的体检，顺便也想看一下医生，因为喉咙痛加上有点感冒。我也有问前台能不能顺便做 swab test，前台说可以，到时和医生讲就好。

结果我一走进医生的房间，她第一句话就是叫我“进来前要敲门”，ok好的。我照她的要求量完血压、听诊后，我就想着应该可以开始看病了吧，我就跟她说我的喉咙不舒服的事情，结果她像看到怪物一样突然退很远，还一直狂按消毒液洗手。

然后她用一种很不客气的语气说：“你知道这是传染病吗？”我真的一整个问号❓❓我感冒了来看医生，不然是要我怎样？她还一直讲我没有跟前台讲，但我真的有讲啊。

整体感觉就是病人来求助反而被责怪。护士们态度都很好，但医生那种反应真的让我很失望。

For this amount, she said it will be out of goodwill charging it cheaper for one session. They said I could reconsider and book my appointment if I am  interested, so I ended up having to pay $43+ for the consultation fee.

After calling two different dental clinics, I found out they are only charging $150 to $200 at the most for scaling and polishing with numbing cream. Would suggest people to check for prices elsewhere it will most likely be more affordable.

Family Dental Centre Victoria Hougang,1,"My husband had a very disappointing experience at this dental clinic in Jan 2025. He went in for a routine general cleaning, but without any prior explanation or consent, they proceeded with a deep cleaning instead which was barely only for less than 15minutes. He was completely unaware of this and was hit with a hefty $300+ bill at the end!

To make things worse, they did not provide a receipt or a cost breakdown, claiming that they are ""not supposed to"" issue any for insurance claims. This is highly questionable, as other dental clinics have no issue providing such documentation.

The lack of transparency and poor communication is unacceptable. Patients deserved to be informed about the procedures being done and the costs involved beforehand. This experience left us feeling misled and overcharged. We would never recommend this clinic to anyone looking for honest and professional dental care.",2025-02-10T06:59:04.370Z,healthcare

Northeast Medical Group (Sengkang Clinic),1,"I had a deeply unpleasant experience with Dr. Wong Chin Shing Sam, and felt compelled to share it in hopes of informing others. It was truly a culture shock for me this was the first time I’ve encountered a medical professional so rude and dismissive. It was genuinely a huge culture shock for me.

I brought my elderly grandmother in for a consultation, hoping for basic respect and attentiveness, but unfortunately, we were met with the opposite. As another reviewer rightly pointed out, his tone was harsh and completely lacking in warmth or empathy. He seemed disinterested throughout, brushing off our questions and speaking to my granny in a way that was unnecessarily curt and disrespectful.

It was clear to both of us that he had no intention of engaging with care or patience. My grandmother left the clinic feeling dismissed and demoralized, and we both wholeheartedly agreed that the way he treated her was unkind and unprofessional.

I understand that not every patient-doctor interaction will be warm and fuzzy, but basic decency and respect should never be compromised especially when dealing with elderly patients. This experience has left a lasting negative impression, and I would not recommend him based on our visit.",2025-07-30T10:01:05.344Z,healthcare
Northeast Medical Group (Sengkang Clinic),1,"It was a terrible experience. I had a fever, sore throat, and red spots on my body. The service attitude at the counter was not good. The doctor dismissed me in less than 5 minutes and i have ask isit HFMD or what n he just said I just had common folliculitis and prescribed steroids. I went home and applied it once, and I felt very uncomfortable. And the red spots kept increasing. What was even more strange was that I said I didn't have a cough or nasal congestion, but he prescribed me a cough and nasal congestion solution. He didn't give me any antipruritic medicine, antipyretic medicine, antibiotics, etc. After two days, it became more and more serious. I went to another clinic and was diagnosed with chickenpox! I also showed the second doctor the prescription given by my first doctor. The second doctor said that steroids cannot be applied to chickenpox because it will reduce our immunity and the chickenpox will increase. This is why my fever keeps coming back. In short, this is a very unprofessional and careless clinic. I advise everyone not to go here if you have serious cases. Anyway, they were hurt badly this time, and it cost a lot.糟糕的体验，本来就发烧喉咙痛 身体出现小红点，柜台服务态度也不好，医生更是面诊不到5分钟就了事，说我只是普通的毛囊炎，给我开了类固醇。我回家涂了一次 就感觉很不舒服 而且 越来越样 红点越来越多，更奇怪的是我说了我没有咳嗽鼻塞 他却偏偏给我开了咳嗽鼻塞的药水 也没有给我止痒药退烧药抗生素什么的。过了两天越来越严重 我去看另外一件诊所 诊断为水痘！我还给第二个医生看了我的第一个医生给的药方，第二个医生说水痘不能涂类固醇 它会使我们的免疫力下降 水痘的痘会越来越多 这就是为什么我的发烧反反复复不会好。总之这家就是非常不专业不用心的诊所就对了 劝大家有什么严重的病例不要去这里看 ，反正这次是给他们害惨了，而且花费还不少。",2025-07-28T03:50:32.399Z,healthcare

Northeast Medical Group (Sengkang Clinic),1,"Dr Sam Wong…

Came in with sore throat and an infected eye. Had similar symptoms 2-3 weeks back and was prescribed certain medications which I had informed him of. Dr Sam Wong insisted it was not bacterial infection, but a viral one. But I clarified I have no cough, flu, blocked nose (after his attempt to suggest it’s viral), and then he proceeded to suggest it’s acid reflux? And asked if I eat spicy food, sour food, etc - to which I replied NO for all the above. He then asked if I wear contacts and I said no.

After having multiple “no”s to probes that align with his insistence that it’s viral infection, he then said he can provide antibiotics but he doesn’t think it will work. Just to clarify - I did not ask for antibiotics to be prescribed I just noted that I took it previously when I had the same symptoms 2/3 wks ago. Here, I would like to ask, what’s the point of his diagnosis when all questions are asked to feed his inherent assumptions and his reluctance to provide a medication which he thinks wouldn’t even work?!

He then also added on that my previous set of eye drops contain antibiotics and that my eye infection is because of allergy. Well I guess  I can suddenly develop allergies that I do not know of. But he proceeded to probe if it’s painful when I already said no, there’s no feeling it’s just red! And he wouldn’t explain why he thinks it’s allergy as well, just “it’s allergy” x2

I believe that his certification to be a family doctor goes beyond being assuming.

Medication I got at check out:
- Antibiotics (reluctantly given out)
- Allergy eye drops

Well and I thought that I will be getting a sore throat medicine that aligns with his supposed diagnosis but no! I don’t expect every doctor to diagnose patients perfectly due to subjectivity and reactivity, but there was literally no diagnosis. He just gave me what I had 2/3 weeks ago, the thing he said wouldn’t work.

Management needs to review his suitability as a family doctor for reputational and business competency. Ultra disapponting",2025-06-10T15:47:23.956Z,healthcare

Northeast Medical Group (Sengkang Clinic),1,"I had a very disappointing experience during my recent visit to Northeast Clinic with Dr. Wong. I shared that I had been coughing for more than two weeks and was beginning to experience mild breathing difficulties. However, Dr. Wong quickly dismissed my concerns and insisted it was acid reflux, stating that “a cough can’t last so long.” He didn’t seem interested in exploring other possibilities or asking further questions.

Instead, he immediately started advising me to avoid tea, coffee, spicy, and oily food. Then, without any basis, he asked, “You smoke, right?” When I replied no, he completely ignored my answer and continued telling me to quit smoking. He then asked if I drank alcohol. Again, I said no, but he brushed past that and told me to stop drinking. He finished by saying, “Most importantly, you must lose weight — once you’re slim, everything will be okay.”

I was appalled by this dismissive and presumptive approach. I left the clinic feeling unheard and disrespected. A doctor should listen, ask questions, and consider the patient’s input — not make assumptions or offer one-size-fits-all advice without proper diagnosis. I hope the clinic takes this feedback seriously to ensure better care for future patients.",2025-05-26T07:30:04.347Z,healthcare
Northeast Medical Group (Sengkang Clinic),1,"An extremely disappointing and distressing experience my partner and I had during a recent visit to your clinic, under the care of Dr. Wong Chin Shing Sam.

My partner was suffering from a high fever, severe body aches, and overall physical discomfort. However, the consultation we received fell drastically short of acceptable medical standards. The entire appointment lasted less than one minute, during which Dr. Wong displayed a concerning lack of thoroughness and empathy.

Despite us clearly and repeatedly explaining that my partner had been experiencing persistent back pain and body aches that were unresponsive to over-the-counter painkillers, Dr. Wong dismissed our concerns. He neither conducted a physical examination nor attempted to assess the affected areas. Instead, he insisted that it was nothing serious and continued to suggest the same painkillers, offering no alternative diagnosis or further investigation.

Additionally, for the fever, no proper treatment plan was discussed. My partner was advised merely to rest. He exhibited no respiratory symptoms (such as coughing or a sore throat), yet was prescribed medication that appeared unrelated to his condition, raising questions about the relevance and necessity of the prescriptions. More concerningly, no antibiotics were prescribed, nor were any referrals suggested.

The entire consultation felt rushed, impersonal, and dismissive. It did not meet even the most basic expectations of a medical check-up, let alone a professional evaluation tailored to the patient’s reported symptoms.

Reading the reviews, this is not the first time that there were complaints regarding Dr. Wong’s conduct and approach toward patients. It is deeply troubling that despite such recurring feedback, there appears to be little accountability or corrective action taken. A doctor’s attitude and attentiveness can significantly impact a patient’s health and well-being, and in this case, we left the clinic feeling frustrated, unheard, and concerned for the quality of care being provided to others.

I sincerely hope this complaint will be taken seriously. I urge the clinic to conduct a thorough review of this incident and consider implementing improved protocols to ensure that all patients receive respectful, attentive, and competent care.",2025-05-24T06:30:57.175Z,healthcare

This experience was particularly frustrating given that I was experiencing a bad cough, flu and difficulty in breathing. Instead of receiving assistance, I was told to find another clinic. This response coming from a clinic where patients seeks medical attention from, is truly disappointing.

If your clinic closes before the stated time, I urge you to update your hours to reflect this accurately.

The doctor was impatient and didn't even listen to my entire experience (with my health issue which is relating to some skin problems) and quickly cut me off, dismissing me without even telling me a cause or anything and saying that it's nothing serious. He repeatedly asked ""is that all?"" with a glum expression with absolutely zero sympathy or care for his job. A consultation fee of $35,was definitely not worth it especially since our conversation was barely worth 2 minutes.
What's worse is that he had given me the wrong prescription of medication for my condition and I had only found out about it when I went to see a skin specialist.
If you're unsure of the issue, I would have respected you if you had just suggested that I should see a specialist from the start instead of wasting my time and causing my condition to worsen. It's serious to prescribe the wrong medication due to poor evaluation.",2025-01-24T12:42:41.148Z,healthcare

Honestly, he should consider a career as a fortune teller—he seemed to diagnose me just by looking at my face.

This isn't the first time I've visited this place, I've been here quite a few times but this was the first time I was assisted by her... In my opinion, she was very unprofessional and unreliable.

Woodlands Health Campus,1,"My son was brought in by ambulance on 27th Aug morning for motorcycle accident.
Doctor who saw him told him that his wounds required deeper cleaning and has to be done under GA. Told him to stay fasted .
After that there were no more updates.
All the nurses from ED said was JUST WAIT ,Day surgery is not available and they cannot check.

At 9pm he was told no surgery slot available has to wait till next day.
Till date, its almost 24hrs since his accident
Is the hospital waiting for more severe infection to happen before attending to this patient?
I totally understand your hospital is new , short staffs , busy etc .

Woodlands Health Campus,1,"I had a very troubling experience at the A&E on 25 August (morning). What I witnessed from the medical staff was highly unprofessional and not what patients should be exposed to when seeking care.

1. Poor coordination – Multiple doctors and nurses asked the same questions and repeated the same checks, showing confusion and lack of communication.

2. Overpowering scents – Several staff were heavily doused in perfume/cologne to the point it was unbearable and even gave me a headache. This is inappropriate in a clinical environment.

3. Compromised hygiene – Nurses were seen sitting on empty patient beds. This raised serious concerns about cleanliness and sterility.

4. Unprofessional behaviour – A doctor and several nurses were being overly casual and playful with each other during duty hours. Their conduct did not reflect the professionalism expected in a hospital setting.

5. Noise and disruption – Staff were laughing and talking loudly in the early morning hours, disturbing patients who were unwell and trying to rest.

The overall atmosphere felt less like a hospital ward and more like a social gathering, which was shocking and disappointing. Patients deserve professionalism, respect, and a healing environment, not this. I sincerely hope the hospital takes these issues seriously and implements urgent improvements.",2025-08-23T22:48:21.618Z,healthcare
Woodlands Health Campus,5,"I recently stayed in Woodlands Health Campus, SSSU Ward B23, Bed 1 (Aug 15–17, 2025) for my pre-op review and recovery, and I genuinely couldn’t have asked for a better experience.

From day one, the orthopedic team was fantastic — professional, kind, and incredibly patient in explaining my condition and treatment so I could really understand what was going on. That made a huge difference in helping me stay calm and confident.

The nursing staff were absolute stars. A special shout-out to the night shift on Aug 15 and the afternoon shift on Aug 16 — they were warm, attentive, and had a great balance of efficiency and genuine care. They checked in often without me feeling like I was being “hovered” over.

Woodlands Health Campus,1,"It was a terrible experience, the financial consult over the phone versus what i had to pay was ten times the difference!!!  The financial consult on the 3rd floor was a joke!!  Spent 15 mintues sitting there while she tried to figure out how much. Mine is a straight forward case, referred by Poly clinic, 100% subsidized and a Singaporean.

I had asked for an estimate but was wrongly advised over the phone!  I was caught off guard at the huge bill!  I should have said NO but  I was at the hospital for the appointment!

On top of that, after 2 weeks the bill is still not out! I tried without sucess to find out the course ofthe review after the minor ops but was told that there was none!!! Hospital should not start to operate if they have not figured out their billing process.

I really regret going there! would definitely not choose to go there!  Please be careful!",2025-08-14T08:29:54.486Z,healthcare
Woodlands Health Campus,1,"What is the purpose of having a queue system when there is no intention to adhere to it?  In between patients, the doctor took a long time to call the next patient, aggravating the length of waiting time.

The health hub app showed 18 minutes waiting time at one moment. 5 minutes later, the waiting time became 40 minutes?? The app does not show the number of patients before you, it just reflects a ""-"".

Prepared to wait given that this is a public hospital but had had
much better experience at NUH, which is a lot more crowded but the waiting time is acceptable (within an jour). This clinic at Woodland Health campus is not crowded(see attached photo), the doctor just took way too long between patients. Doctor is in orthopaedic department.

Only two visitor allow per patient. so need to alert the 3rd +n visitor to take their turn to visit. the gantry does signal when you tap your identification card upon entry to the lift.

hope the woodlands health campus could upgrade their self service kiosk machine. allow the kiosk machine to scan our IC card detail so that we do not need to key ourself manually. it weird that we need to scan our ic at the kiosk and still manually key our details down. ???

Woodlands Health Campus,1,"Very disappointed, my father got accident and hospitalised here, for 3days no doubt the service are well taken and the nurse are very efficient but! But!
after hospitalised
In 24/7 they asked him to come back for checkups. He travel from JB to SG with wounds and broken shoulder. When he reach there they said they didn’t ask him to come back for checkups, so wasted 6-7hours and transportation fee.
28/7 they ask him to do checkup, but when he reach they stated that he need to go another hospital for checkups “which didn’t inform advance” waste is time again!
28/7 they know about my father’s company will cover all the fee , but still ask him to contact company about a checkup fee $2k+ is it covered? But the thing is they should email to confirm with the company not the patient, which in case they didn’t even email company about $2k fee (after my father check with company) which is odd and troublesome. Just in case the company already cover $20k!
A wounded patient travels and wasted time due to didn’t even contact earlier or email the info about anything, all is vocally appointed, this had made us very annoying and troublesome.
I hope the hospital take this matter seriously, not all the patients have the will to travel so long hours for nothing, do you even consider he also need time to rest? And accidents/wound might get worse just to waste time on nothing?
This supposedly can be avoid by many ways, please don’t wasted our time.",2025-07-29T13:24:20.260Z,healthcare

To the management, aren’t there no suggestions and feedbacks to be organized to distribute manpower and delegate the tasks accordingly? Utterly disorganised. No proper handing over of reports and some information is missing out about certain patients’ needs and conditions to hand over to next shift nurses and doctors.  I may not be smart but I am not stupid either. I observed and I listened.

For any medical staffs, You want to gossip about people flaws in whatever they are requesting for , diagnosis which you thought of is a small thing and cackled about it, you may brush it off now. Perhaps when you or your loved ones go through something similar, you’ll learn the importance of empathy .Hope there are more rooms for improvement.

I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) emergency responders who promptly came to assist my eldest daughter, during a medical emergency at Changi Airport Terminal 2 at around 6:30pm on 3 September 2025, and to the team of doctors, nurses, and medical staff at the Changi General Hospital (CGH) Emergency Department who subsequently took over her care.

My daughter had suffered a severe allergic reaction (Anaphylaxis) and the situation was extremely critical. Amid the chaos, we were unable to thank everyone individually or record your names. However, the professionalism, calmness, and kindness you displayed left a deep and lasting impression on our family.

The SCDF team arrived swiftly on scene, acted with clarity and coordination, and helped buy crucial time for further treatment.
The CGH emergency medical team then took over seamlessly, providing highly professional and attentive care that brought us a sense of trust and reassurance in a moment of great anxiety.

We are deeply grateful for the dedication and compassion you showed during such a critical moment, and we hold the highest respect for the work you do every day.

Through this message, we would like to extend our family’s sincere appreciation. We wish each of you continued good health and strength as you go on to support many more people with your skill and warmth.

And im not just talking about the ridiculous waiting time - ours concluded at 6 freaking damn hours and that's only after I've decided to demand for an update for my elderly father. Doctors were extremely subpar in their explanations. I called an ambulance for my father for a reason and we weren't provided with a specific answer in the end just because his symptoms have subsided from the ambulance and on the way to the hospital. A ridiculous 'doctor' even explained to me a 'reason' for it supposedly but funny what she pointed out at wasn't even a direct reply to my exact question. Yes they are there to save lives but with their attitudes and service, it seems like they're just wishing for every patient to disappear than having to address them.

Verdict: I am happy with the A&E services I received. From 11.30 pm on 7 Aug Thursday to 2.30am on 8 Aug , I observed people around me being well cared for. I noted how the team of doctors and staff were well-organised, attentive and even sensitive.

I felt well taken care of, from the pre-registration to the triage, to the general doctor, to the eye doctor. Yes, there was a wait for the general doctor, but the 30-40 min was not unreasonable, and the waiting room was clean and pleasant, the toilets were clean, the chairs were comfortable, the a/c wasn’t too cold (one could ask for blankets if needed)

So, really none of the stuff I primed myself for based on the many negative reviews.

The next morning, I experienced the eye clinic at the medical centre as the eye doctor asked me to report back for a check at 8.30am. After an hour wait, (the place was crowded with 60 other patients), I saw the same doctor (Leong)  I had seen the night before. She was being very careful with her assessment. I felt assured.

In summary, I felt grateful to receive this level of care and that I could debunk the negative impression that I had primed myself with.",2025-08-09T02:40:58.822Z,healthcare

He prescribed her with antibiotics. Went back home and gave her antibiotics for 2 days and the medicine did not work at all. She kept complaining that it was itchy and even progressed to pain to the affected area. I googled and realised her symptoms was skeeter syndrome, not mosquito infection. Skeeter syndrome and mosquito infection is very similar but skeeter syndrome comes with itching and develops within hours while mosquito infection develops after several days with no itching. After I applied eczema cream on the affected area, her swelling started to subside and she stopped complaining of itch and pain.

But the one taking my registration was really something. Zero customer service. I presented you my CHAS card and you ask me if I’m Singaporean? Isn’t CHAS card only presented to Singaporean. Not even PRs? Then you took my temperature but don’t have the decency to show it up to my eye level? I have to crouch down to YOUR level to see it? You can’t even tell me my temperature? Is this how you are dealing with sick patients? No ounce of compassion?,2025-04-24T05:17:29.491Z,healthcare
T Medical Clinic (Canberra),5,"Dr. Tan Yuan Zi is the only doctor I trust now. When I had a really bad eye infection, I had already been to two clinics and even a hospital, but nothing helped. It was only after seeing Dr. Tan and following his recommendation to an eye specialist that things finally got better. That experience alone won me over completely.

He also recommended a fantastic gynae, and since then, I’ve stuck with him for everything. He’s attentive, sincere, and never makes you feel rushed. My toddler, who’s usually very shy around doctors, actually warms up to him, and even asked him for stickers which says a lot!

It’s rare to find someone who’s not just skilled, but genuinely cares. Dr. Tan’s now our go-to doctor, and I honestly don’t see that changing anytime soon.",2025-04-16T06:24:48.127Z,healthcare

I went Khoo Teck Phuat eye clinic next morning and she told.me there was nothing there. Lesson learnt...never go gp for eye issue like this.

Its one of the main clinics in Yishun Avenue 11.
They stop providing service 1 hour prior to closing for the morning, afternoon or evening.
Since there is usually only 1 doctor everyday, its taxing for him or her to deal with multiple customers in one period.
Staff are not necessarily bad; its the issue of dealing with multiple files, searching of medicines and handling customers, especially if there're only 2 staff.

Today, I'm glad I chose this clinic because I contacted covid and needed their services, and since my home is nearby, I can conveniently go home and rest before seeing the doctor.

Am always thankful to have met kind and compassionate medical staffs and especially to doctors who treat patients and cases seriously.

Only minus point is that their 24h clinic consultant price is abit high as compared to other private practices but they did inform over the phone before going down. Medication/jabs is on the normal range.

While the doctors I’ve encountered at this clinic have been adequate and professional, I believe there is significant room for improvement in the service provided by the front desk staff.

Patients who visit clinics are usually unwell and require timely medical attention. During my recent visit, I was turned away because the medical insurance portal was down. The reception staff simply advised me to “come back later,” without offering a specific timeframe or any form of follow-up. A more helpful approach could have been to offer a call-back once the system was restored.

On previous visits, when my insurance e-card failed to load, the receptionists did not attempt to verify my details or check the system manually. I was asked to pay in cash if I wished to proceed, despite being covered by insurance. In those situations, I paid out-of-pocket and filed a claim later due to the urgency of my condition.

What I’ve consistently observed is a lack of empathy and initiative from the reception team. While technical issues can arise, the clinic could enhance the patient experience by training front desk staff to be more proactive, solution-oriented and understanding of patients’ needs.",2025-06-09T02:49:13.522Z,healthcare

Unihealth 24-Hr Clinic (Yishun),1,"This 1-star review is only for consultation by doctor.

I started visiting this clinic 2 years ago, and have given a 5-star rating. My first consultation was by Dr Gerald Fung, who was very professional and attentive. Since then I had nunerous revisits and seen other doctors on duty with no negative comments.

Today, I have decided to downgrade the rating to 1-star after being consulted by Dr Jonathon Hee whom I am seeing for the first time.

I explained to Dr Hee about my reason for consultation and explained my pre-exisiting medical condition (gout) as I believe my medical history should be captured in their system. Dr Hee told me that he feels that my leg pain is not due to gout when I requested for colchicine. He wanted to prescribe only arcoxia to relief the pain instead. I then told him that I had taken arcoxia for the past 2 days. When I asked him what was his professional opinion if he think this is not gout related, he asked me to come and take a blood test and x ray at the clinic or visit a polyclinic tomorrow.

He then mentioned that he did not want to ""argue"" with me about the diagnosis, and abruptly prescribed colchicine and ended the consultation.

Unihealth 24-hr Clinic should review Dr Jonathon Hee's poor attitude and lack of professionalism and compassion. It is sad to see such an unprofessional doctor serving at this clinic or any where else. I believe I am not the only one as I have also read other negative reviews on Dr Jonathon Hee. I would have given him a 0-star if I can.",2025-04-13T14:42:49.476Z,healthcare

Canberra Care Medical Clinic,5,"Although I've moved to Marsiling, I'll still make the trip with my toddlers to see Dr Sophia.

Dr Sophia is great with toddlers, giving them the right medication, and safely administering suppositories for my toddlers when they had a prolonged high fever. Their fever dropped almost immediately. She also quickly diagnosed influenza in my teen. The whole team is friendly and caring.

AE Medical Clinic,2,"Booked yesterday 16 May 3pm appointment one hour before. Waited for 30min then only seen doctor. The doctor did dengue blood test for me due to red rashes throughout the body although I did not have body ache or fever, as the doctor claimed that some dengue patients could only have red rashes as a symptom. Can only review result 2-3 days later at the clinic and settle payment on the spot, but the staff took 5-10min to confirm that after I checked with them at the counter, as the waiting time was pointless and wasting my time. I found the red rashes doubled up today morning and quickly consulted at virtual clinic. The doctor diagnosed its hives by seeing the red rashes disappeared for a moment after I pressed on it. And Meds and cream are otw to my home. In short, visiting this clinic may lead to seeing inexperienced doctor and staff, wasting money for doing unnecessary test.

Northland Family Clinic & Surgery,1,"I have been to this clinic multiple times, and I have to commend Dr. Lee Hwee Ming for being a helpful and patient doctor. However, I must address a concerning issue regarding the elderly receptionist at the front desk. During my previous visits, despite her somewhat unprofessional manner of speaking, I chose to overlook it to avoid causing any trouble. However, during my two most recent visits, I found that her attitude became increasingly bothersome.

The clinic's posted consultation hours are from 8:30 am to 12:30 pm and from 2:30 pm to 6:00 pm. Last week, when I called and was informed that they accepted the last patient at 5:30 pm, I ensured to arrive within that timeframe out of respect. Yet, upon my arrival, I was scolded for arriving ""late"". I explained my work commitments and confirmed the last acceptance time with them beforehand, but she kept on lecturing and told me “You could’ve just come earlier”, as it could affect their closing time and caused them to leave later. She added on saying that the doctor actually did not want to see me since I was “late”.

So, today, I made an effort to arrive earlier around 5:15 pm since leaving work earlier wasn't feasible. But guess what? Still got an earful for being 'late.' I was like, seriously? She went on about how we shouldn't wait until the last hour, and this led me to question why the consultation hours are showing 6:00 pm if arriving at 5:15 pm was deemed late. When I asked if the morning hours were until 12:30 pm, she shut that down too, saying I should've been even earlier than 12pm, and just apply leave and come in the morning. Throughout the conversation, her tone remained rude, demanding, and unprofessional, which was incredibly frustrating.

Honestly, the clinic should just revise their hours to 12 pm and 5 pm if that's what the receptionist wants. And they seriously need to address her attitude. I saw similar complaints in other Google reviews, and it's not a good look for the clinic, deterring regular patients like me from returning.",2024-03-27T13:30:02.838Z,healthcare

Which receptionist? The elderly one.
They didn't ask about company insurance.. made me pay and then told me they don't know how to claim and made me wait another 30 mins bcos they have to ask the Dr to settle....hello? Isn't that the receptionist job?
Also, other clinics ask upon registration about company insurance or put up signs...they didn't.
HOW CAN YOU EXPECT EVERYONE TO KNOW HOW YOU WORK ?

the other clinic I went to, ask upon registration if we have company insurance and teach us how to do claim.
How can the receptionist blame the patient for not knowing the procedure for claims ?

Northshore Family Clinic,5,"This afternoon, I had food poisoning and went to the clinic. I was a walk-in patient, and because the stomach pain was so severe, I was standing outside holding my stomach the whole time. Dr. Goh saw me and asked if I was feeling very cold. I weakly replied that I had food poisoning and was in a lot of pain. I was not sure if he heard me as I was so weak and my voice was so soft. A short while later, he arranged for me to be seen earlier. During the consultation, he was very patient, caring, and responsible, which truly moved me.

Northshore Family Clinic,5,"Came here occasionally just for Dr Joel and Dr Wong. The clinic here is very busy due to its reputation, but the professionalism and standards are still well maintained!

The staff was friendly and understanding, from registration to collecting medications, there was no sign of impatience or attitude from the staff.

For the staff, they took the time to explain the dosage and what the medication is for. They even assisted to help process claims for company coverage. Not sure about the name but it was a young friendly lady wearing a hijab, maybe it’s cause the medication names are too complex in the field of medicine so I can’t understand anything but she still too the time to explain everything properly, which makes me feel comfortable and at ease 😅.

The doctors were friendly and make sure that they listen to the symptoms before providing a check and diagnosis.

Staff Attitude: 5/5

Cleanliness: 5/5

I feel assured that Dr Joel knows immediately what needs to be done and executed efficiently. He stained my eyes to locate the missing contact and found it broken. He explained to me the contact location in my eye and what he is going to do to take it out. He took the 2 pieces of broken lens out efficiently with NO discomfort and showed me the broken pieces ensuring there is not further pieces.

I didn’t need to wait long to see him as he has already pre-registered me. He patiently explained what types of medication he will be giving me and what measures I should take moving forward, so that I can know for certain what I’m allergic to and better manage any hives outbreak that might occur in future.

When I said I needed medicine for migraine, he heard ""my brain"". Twice I repeated the word migraine. He even had the audacity to comment that I needed to change my mask because he couldnt hear me. Something is seriously wrong with this Dr. Wasted 10 mins of my life.

Essential Family Clinic & Surgery,4,"Haven't been here in 9 years, since childhood. The receptionist was friendly, speaking both English and Chinese, but there was a brief miscommunication where either of us misheard each other for COVID-19 symptoms (I think she asked, ""Show symptoms?"" while I heard ""No symptoms?""). Overall, she was humble and kind.

The miscommunication meant that I was assigned to enter Room 2, reserved for COVID-19 patients. The doctor asked me about my symptoms when I clarified I was there for a migraine and needed painkillers, not a swab test. Nevertheless, he was quick to serve me.

I wouldn't call him rude or insensitive, I've experienced worse. He was curt, asking questions, and then it was over in less than 3 minutes. I requested an MC for 1 day to rest and he gave it without question.

Docking 1 star because of a surprise addition to the prescribed medication. I think now I understand what other patients complained about. I think it's good to ask him exactly what he'll be prescribing you in case.

Dr Lee was exceptionally patient throughout.

Caring Medical Clinic (Pasir Ris West Plaza),5,"I started seeing Dr Lee Jing Kun at Woodleigh Family Clinic in February 2024 for my younger son who was frequently falling sick with sore throat and fever. Despite past treatments, his condition persisted affecting his studies during PSLE year. Dr Lee’s keen diagnostic skills led to an influenza test as my son got H1N1 in December 2024 and the test revealing a faint positive. He assured me antibiotics weren’t needed and true enough, my son recovered with just fever medication.

What truly sets Dr Lee apart is his thoroughness. He identified my son’s inflamed tonsils as the root cause, advised dietary changes and after two follow ups, my son stopped experiencing monthly fevers and sore throats!

I too became Dr Lee’s patient due to chronic sinusitis and frequent inflammation. His diagnosis explained my persistent voice blockage something even an ENT specialist overlooked. With his treatment, I’m now much better.

Recently in Jan 25 when my elder son had an ear infection, I discovered Dr Lee had moved. After just one visit to another clinic, I knew I had to find him. I google his name and realised he is at Caring Medical Clinic in Pasir Ris and didn’t hesitate to bring my son there. I stay in Woodleigh and the distance is quite far for me, I really don't trust any doctor except Dr Lee 😅

Dr Lee’s dedication, compassion and expertise will give me peace of mind and I trust the way he prescribe the medication.Even though my mother-in-law has a regular doctor near Serangoon Gardens, my husband chose to bring her to Dr Lee despite the distance. He insisted on it because her previous doctor wasn’t thorough enough which led to her being hospitalized.  Doctors like Dr Lee are rare. I’m truly grateful and trust him wholeheartedly with my family’s health.

Dr. Mervin is very friendly, patient, and never rushed. As an overthinker, I truly appreciate this because it made me feel completely comfortable during the consultation.

Lion Health Clinic & Surgery (Yishun),1,"Frankly, I am appalled by what I witnessed during my recent visit.

Your Manager, Kim the lady in the red dress today behaved in a manner that was completely unprofessional and outright disrespectful which needs to be checked if she’s fit for her role as she works as though the world has given her an unhappy life. She spoke to a staff member with an attitude that was not only dismissive, but shockingly rude! The staff member was asking a relevant question related to their work respectfully, mind you and Kim responded in a tone that was cold, condescending, and completely lacking in basic human decency. She cut them off mid-sentence in front of me while they were doing their job and assisting me.

This is not the first time I’ve seen her speak this way to staff. This is now the third visit where I’ve witnessed similar behavior from her. But today’s incident was by far the worst and absolutely, unacceptable.

Let me be clear: no employee deserves to be treated that way, especially not in front of patients. I can only imagine how much worse it gets behind closed doors when no one is watching. If this is the standard of leadership being upheld here, it’s absolutely disgraceful.

Something needs to be done. No patient should be watching a manager tear down their own team like that. And no staff should have to endure that kind of treatment
especially not from someone who’s supposed to be setting an example.

This needs to be addressed immediately.",2025-07-29T09:28:40.559Z,healthcare

Edgedale Medical Clinic,1,"i really want to give this clinic a 5-star review because the receptionist and one of the doctors (morning shift as far as i know) is very very kind to me and my children.

i brought my daughter to the clinic last week Tuesday as she had two spots near her mouth, which i suspected the start of HFMD. first and foremost i was there at 6pm, on the 15th July. he was late but me and my daughter still wait patiently and quietly. during the consultation, the Doctor, Dr Ryan Ho, dismissed us and seemed in a hurry. i asked if a memo was needed but he asked me to monitor further. so i was like hmm ok....

i came down again one the 22nd (Tuesday too) around 11am after fetching my daughter from school as she seemed to have an unknown allergy; started by hives on the side of her left hand then spreaded to legs and was itching everywhere. it was the first time and no one in my family had any history of allergies so YES i didn't know what to do. the attending doctor (which i didn't take down his name, urghhhh i wish i could give credits to him because he is by far the best doctor that attended to my children) prescribed me the flu med and calamine lotion. she stopped itching, which i am thankful for but yesterday i noticed that my daughter's body had red heaty patches. today, it surprisingly come and go. her Teacher even updated me that her right cheek went red after a waterplay activity but when i fetched her, there wasn't until i reached home and her cheeks went unusual red again. she was itching her hands so i decided to bring to the clinic. and yes it was Dr Ryan Ho.

i felt belittle and felt that he doesn't bother on checking on my daughter giving the doubting face expressions even through the mask. all i want to find out was if it was caused by the allergy rash, and what should i do as i believe if the rash persists, i should come back?? he really just went ahead and asked me ""is her face red now? is it itchy now?"" to which i replied not now, but before we came over she was itching and it was red, it comes and goes. he simple said she need to just eat the flu meds. ALSO not to forget he even gave an example of ""if i allergic to seafood, just eat the flu med first then eat"" - what kind of advice is this? that’s horrible advice for a child with suspected allergy, especially when the trigger isn’t even identified yet. for a child that's 2 years old? you'd want me to jeopardise my child just like that? so why can't people with allergies just eat the flu med and that'll make the world a better place i suppose??

proceeded to ask me how often i washed the bedsheet and soft toys to which i replied every week. and his response? ""you just need to improve what you're doing now"" excuse me which part of ""come and go"" do you not understood? i couldn't take it when he laughed it out when i told him ""thing is i don't want them to rely on medicine too much"" and he went off with ""no choice you know you allergic you eat medicine"". at this point i was feeling crappy. i felt like i wasn't heard. i am a disappointed mother i don't even know what guilt i have - to come to that clinic or that i can't find the answer to my daughter's allergy.

i went out, made the payment and stood my ground and talked to one of the male receptionist (didn't get your name but i really appreciate your listening ears and how kind you are!) i cried while giving the feedback and yes it was tears of anger.

i don't wish to jeopardise on his position or job. before i wrote this in, i read the reviews and people are mentioning about him too.

i just hope we are really paying for what we are in to consult for. don't treat us like govt polyclinic with 20 people waiting for you lr consultation - even they do better.

thank you for reading. i hope this gets a response and i would love to know if this matter has been brought up to the upper management. thank you.",2025-07-24T15:11:18.631Z,healthcare

Edgedale Medical Clinic,1,"Was attended by Dr Ryan Ho a few nights ago, and I felt that the attention and commitment he displayed was lacking. Rather, it felt very much like he was just going through the motions, with minimal eye contact during consultation, and did not provide meaningful advice on a treatment plan for my condition. I left the clinic feeling deeply dissatisfied and disappointed, having experienced much better consultations and service with Dr Yan when accompanying other family members in their times of need.

If you are sick and having fever, all you wanna do is to take your medicine as quickly as possible after the consultation and go back home to rest.

However the receptionist here have no empathy, they only dispatch the medicine only when they have 3-4 patient order together then they start moving.

I do not understand why they can’t dispatch it immediately once they have the doctor instruction. While must pile up and then release one shot to the patient. It is very uncomfortable sitting outside while you’re inside relaxing in the aircon room with a nice cushion chair.

I was wondering why is it always long queue - actually the queue was due to the slow medicine dispense!

Not very smart and No Empathy.

Singapore Thong Chai Medical Institution - Chin Swee Rd (Headquarters),3,"I attended an acupuncture session on Thursday night and was taken aback when the attending male physician mentioned out loud a few times in the treating room that the patient is having multiple medical condition. Medical care is private and confidential and professionalism must be observed at all times especially when the room was filled with so many other patients. Patients know their own medical conditions and it is definitely unwise to make public announcement of that to other patients to stigmatise them. Hope physicians restrict the use of patients’  medical record to treatment only. Please attend to this issue to ensure patients won’t feel threatened and shocked by this kind of practice.
———————————————————————

Appreciate your timely reply, however, the first part of your response regarding holistic assessment and open consultation are not what my feedback was about. The open setting is also not an issue.

I sincerely hope you have spoken to the Thursday’s male physician to refrain from stigmatising patients who have a number of ailments by making open announcement to all unrelated patients. According to the physician schedule, there were only 2 male physicians on that Thursday.

Many thanks to your reply and your effort to look into this matter.",2025-08-20T00:28:55.873Z,healthcare

Singapore Thong Chai Medical Institution - Chin Swee Rd (Headquarters),3,"I was expecting worst as it is a charity run medical clinic, but it was quite pleasant for customer service. The lovely ladies behind the counter would listen intently to what you are here for and if you are new would propose who should you see, when should you come etc. They also clear the registration pretty fast. Imagine i am 64 person behind it got cleared in 20mins, not bad for a charity organisation

Here is why i gave 3 stars.

You need to do your due diligence online reading reviews, who you should be seeing. The 1st guy i seen was extremely rude and obnoxious and not very attentive to what you say making you repeat multiple times  i was in a room with plenty of acupuncuture patients and while sharing experiences we all confirm that same guy being rude, obnoxious and unprofessional, despite being probono. All we ask is some basic respect on leveling as a human being thanks. Mr. How Sek Kwong is especially professional, never fails to answer your queries patiently and pretty good with acupuncture as per photo. Some reviews are saying he is very good with medicine and general consultation too.

They dont allow collection of medicine and general consultation together with acupuncture now so this means you may see a different physician for your illness in dispensing the meds. I really am not quite sure how this would be more time saving or efficient. Its a new thing, and this means an additional physician must do the work seeing you, while your acupuncturist still did the same things reading your pulse.

My GP doesn't work on Saturdays, so I found Medivale near my place through Google reviews. After visiting, I observed that Dr. Phua is kind, friendly, professional, and meticulous. She genuinely listens, asks for detailed medical information, and truly cares—I could feel it.

I visited on Sat morning around 9:30 AM and was likely the first patient. By the time I stepped out, there were about 5 to 7 people waiting. The clinic is very clean, and the clinic assistant is okay—she gives clear instructions in a monotone manner but isn’t rude, which is fine.

The Google reviews show 3.7 stars, but personally, I would give it 4 stars for my first visit.

I came back for a review on 17 Dec around 12:10, just before the clinic’s lunch break. There were a few people ahead of me. A parent was explaining to the clinic assistant that her child needed immediate medical attention and medication. Despite the timing, Ivy didn’t turn them away, even though it probably cut into her lunch break. While I noticed a few negative reviews about Ivy here, my second experience showed she is kind, approachable, and helpful. It’s a good reminder for me not to judge a book by its cover.

I was baffled to hear this as i made an appointment online at around 7pm. If the clinic was overwhelmed, the staff could have contacted me and advised me on the situation and provided alternative clinics to visit instead.

I truly do not appreciate how the staff handled the whole situation. They told me they weren't taking in appointments. Until questioned further, they kept repeating that there were more than 10 patients in-front of me and i had to wait despite having an appointment.

When I shared my frustrations on how the clinic was wasting my time, one staff said "" we have no control over the online system."" I am very sorry but this is not acceptable at all. You cannot just blame it as a system issue when there is no proper procedure in place. Why is there an online appt option when u have no control over it.

I hope this clinic educates their staff on customer service skills, service recovery skills and mostly how to be emphatic and compassionate to people who are sick and vulnerable.

My dad is 70 years old, he is already very sick not sure why we are asked to wait without any order. I specifically asked the attender when we will be called, they told next and they allowed two more people after that.

There's not even a response when we are told we are cancelling the registration.

Northeast Medical Group (Bukit Batok Clinic),1,"On 18 August 2025 at 6:58 pm, I brought my 7-month-old baby to see a doctor as he had a fever with chesty cough and what I suspected were chest retractions. His fever was around 37.9°C. I expressed my concern that his chest movement during breathing didn’t look normal, but the doctor insisted that when babies have fever, it’s normal for them to breathe faster. I repeatedly explained that what worried me was the chest going up and down abnormally, not just the speed of breathing.

The doctor only listened to his back with a stethoscope and said everything was fine, nothing serious. He advised me to sponge my baby with ice water.

When I got home, I told my husband what happened, feeling very upset with the doctor’s response. At first, I tried to monitor my baby at home, but something still didn’t feel right—his fever was worsening. By morning, I rushed him to KKH, and the doctors confirmed that he had wheezing on both sides, worse on the right side. They performed an X-ray, noted that his fever had spiked to 40°C, and admitted him for further checks and nebuliser treatment",2025-08-20T14:19:09.539Z,healthcare

I didn’t believe her diagnosis so I went for a second opinion, and the polyclinic doctor was WAY WAY better. At least she found the actual issue and didnt advise me to go on a dairy-free and gluten-free diet unnecessarily. Plus she gave me medicine that worked!

Brought my mum to see the doctor for covid. She was feeling faint and I had to support her for mobility, the staff rudely ushered her to walk around the building to the back of the clinic. I understand protocol and the need to conduct the swab test at the back of the clinic for isolation purposes, but was it necessary to be so incredibly rude during and throughout the whole process? My mum was quite out of it and asked why we were moving around and when i was explaining to her, the staff rudely turned around to ask 做什么 (what she want) in chinese.

MD International Medical Centre,1,"As a doctor myself, I think I am well placed to leave a comment.

The resident doctor, while well-meaning, has demonstrated an inability to listen and consider basic diagnoses - even when directly suggested to him from a fellow doctor (we only had to see him because of conflict of interest otherwise). He seemed more keen to talk about his fancy equipment - an ophthalmoscope, an ultrasound, and his interest in dermatoscopy, whilst almost completely ignoring the basic condition that we saw him for. These things may look fancy but are definitely no substitute for basic clinical skills.

Separately, the clinic administration is incredibly inept even at the most basic of regular tasks - submitting my FDW’s 6ME results to MOM.

Do consider your visit - there are much more competent GPs around, who care more for their patients and charge lower fees.",2022-02-11T14:58:46.031Z,healthcare

Lifeline Medical Group Sengkang,1,"I am writing to formally lodge a complaint about the unprofessional and inconsiderate behavior of two nurses at Lifeline Medical Group in Sengkang during my mother’s visit to your clinic on 19th August. My mother, who was suffering from a high fever and was visibly weak, visited your clinic alone seeking medical attention. Unfortunately, the treatment she received from your nursing staff was deeply disappointing and far below the standard of care expected from a healthcare provider.
Upon arriving at the clinic, my mother requested a face mask, likely due to her condition and to ensure the safety of others. Instead of assisting her with empathy or offering a solution, the nurses at the counter informed her that masks were not provided for free. They instructed her to leave the clinic, search for a mask elsewhere, and return for her consultation. This response was not only dismissive but also highly inconsiderate, given her weakened state and urgent need for medical attention. Forcing a sick patient to leave the premises to obtain a mask, without any offer of assistance or alternative, is unacceptable and contrary to the principles of compassionate healthcare.
As healthcare professionals, your nursing staff are expected to uphold a duty of care, showing kindness and understanding to patients, especially those who are vulnerable. The behavior exhibited by these nurses was rude, lacked empathy, and failed to reflect the values of Lifeline Medical Group as a trusted healthcare provider in our community. This incident left my mother feeling humiliated and neglected, which is deeply disheartening.
I urge Lifeline Medical Group to investigate this matter thoroughly and take appropriate disciplinary action to address the conduct of the involved staff members. Additionally, I recommend that your clinic implement measures, such as staff training on patient care and empathy, to prevent such incidents from recurring. Ensuring that all patients are treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their circumstances, should be a priority for your organization.",2025-08-19T15:47:58.935Z,healthcare

Lifeline Medical Group Sengkang,1,"I am writing to express my disappointment regarding the rude behaviour I experienced during my recent visit to your clinic for a check-up. As it was my first time at your clinic, I was unfamiliar with your procedures.
After my consultation, I informed the nurse handling the billing that my visit was covered under a corporate account. Instead of responding with understanding, she reacted with visible frustration and said, “Why didn’t you say earlier? Now I have to key in everything again.” I explained that I wasn’t aware of the process, and that in other clinics, the staff would usually ask if it’s a corporate visit. That’s why I mentioned it before making any payment.
Throughout the process, both nurses continued to speak in an angry tone in Chinese, which made me feel uncomfortable and disrespected.
After they completed everything, they did not even inform me that the transaction was settled and that I had nothing to pay. I stood there awkwardly passing her my card for payment, unsure if I could leave, and had to ask twice if everything was done. One of the nurses finally responded in a curt and irritated tone, saying, “Yes, done already. No need to pay.” Her tone was uncalled for and left me feeling embarrassed and unwelcome.
I believe that patients especially first-time visitors should be treated with patience, professionalism, and respect. I hope you will look into this matter and take appropriate steps to ensure that other patients do not go through a similar experience.",2025-07-01T11:19:28.110Z,healthcare

Lifeline Medical Group Sengkang,1,"I am writing to formally file a serious complaint regarding the conduct of both of your receptionists, whose behaviour during my recent visit was shockingly unprofessional, disrespectful, and completely lacking in empathy.

Both I and my mother-in-law were treated with rudeness and hostility. The receptionist raised her voice at us, responded with sarcasm, and handled our questions and concerns with clear annoyance. At no point did she show the basic courtesy or professionalism expected from someone working in a healthcare environment—where patience, compassion, and respectful communication are essential.

This was not just a one-time experience. I’ve since come across multiple reviews and complaints online describing similar encounters with this same individual. It is clear that her behavior has been a consistent problem and has negatively affected many patients.

Given the seriousness and repeated nature of these incidents, I strongly believe she should no longer be working at your clinic. Her actions reflect poorly on your establishment and compromise the quality of care and trust that patients expect when seeking medical attention.

Lifeline Medical Group Sengkang,1,"I am writing to express my deep concern and disappointment regarding the treatment my father received at your clinic on 11 Feb 2025 around 6.30pm . He recently suffered a severe fall, resulting in a deep cut that required 10 stitches. Seeking immediate medical attention, he came to your clinic for help.

For the past 20 years, our family has trusted your clinic and relied on your services whenever we were in need of medical care. We have always appreciated the care provided by your team, especially given that all of your staff are senior professionals whom we have seen for many years. However, on this occasion, we were deeply disappointed by the lack of care and attention shown.

Despite your clinic not having the necessary facilities for stitching, basic care and compassion could have been offered. Instead of providing any assistance, such as covering the wound to prevent infection, or even guiding him to the nearest hospital, your staff allowed him to leave without any proper wound care. He was left to travel to the hospital on his own, which is not only unacceptable but also concerning given his condition.

It is crucial to highlight that if infection had set in during his journey, it could have led to severe complications. As a healthcare facility, I expected a minimum level of care, such as first aid, to help stabilize the situation until he could receive proper treatment.

Given our long-standing relationship with your clinic, and the fact that we’ve always had confidence in the senior staff, this experience was deeply disheartening. The lack of support left my father vulnerable to further harm and demonstrates a worrying disregard for patient safety. I request that you look into this matter seriously and take the necessary steps to ensure that such a situation never happens again.

I would appreciate a prompt response to address this issue, as well as an explanation of the actions you will take to improve the care provided at your clinic moving forward. MOH will be informed of this situation as well.",2025-02-16T06:01:27.475Z,healthcare

Raffles Medical Waterway Point,1,"Agree with the reviews here that they don’t dispense medication promptly causing unnecessary long waiting times. This was alr feedbacked years ago but seems like there’s no change of any kind.

The doctor told my MIL she (doctor) would wait for us parents (me and hubby) to arrive as the medication required quite a bit of instructions to prepare and wasn’t sure my MIL was up for complex instructions.

When we arrived, the doctor in the room told us (in the nurse’s presence), that the nurse will help to dispense medication and explain what to do. We said okay and looked to the nurse for the medication.

However, immediately when we were with the nurse outside the doctor’s room, the nurse’s first question to us was ‘do you still need me to tell you how to use the medication?’. We said yes, and she left us.

We were bewildered as just less than a minute ago the doctor told her clearly to do so and now she is asking us if she really needs to do it as though she didn't hear a single word that the doctor said.

Furthermore, wasn’t that the point of needing my husband and I to be present? That the medical staff wanted to explain the medication since they felt my elderly MIL was not up for it. Then why the change in attitude now and ask if we REALLY need her to explain?

Even after telling the nurse, ‘yes please do the necessary, explain to us how to use the medication as we have never taken it before’, she still refused to explain to us how to use the medication and continued to stall for time and busied herself with other things.

So she would ask us one question, walk away for 10 minutes, come back, ask another question, walk away for 10 minutes, and so on. You get the gist.

Some questions also have no reasons to take so long to process. We told her our son has no drug allergy, yet she walked away for 10 minutes. If there’s no drug allergy, what’s there to process and reprocess? She came back and commented we were waiting for the medication, have we taken it before? Either she has short memory or stalling for time as she kept asking us the same questions.

I understand that they have other patients to tend to, but who on earth asks standard questions one by one then take 10 minutes to process each question? Shouldn’t you ask all standard questions at one go?

I was starting to suspect she doesn’t know how to use the medication hence she kept delaying us and stalled for time. True enough in the end it was a different nurse who had to dispense the medication by then much time was loss for no good reason.

The whole place was such a mess.

The worse is my son needed the medication urgently. So for the nurse to do that was really unethical. Even after we gave the feedback, they didn’t get back to us but just simply told us to move on because it’s in the past.

I would like to ask then does it mean patients don’t have to pay for bills that are for past services rendered since they are already in the past?

I never went back ever since and other clinics like KKH have robust protocols and written instructions for parents to follow. Efficiency is much better at a small fraction of time and money spent.

My biggest regret was that my poor son was made to wait unnecessarily and the doctor then told us because we didn’t have the medication fast enough, there might be irreversible damage to his body.",2025-08-02T03:21:25.995Z,healthcare

FAITH Healthcare (Rivervale) Clinic,1,"Dr aaron is good and attentive but have a bad experience with front desk. Visited the clinic on 21 Aug between 8:30 to 9:30 am.

The malay staff only thought net transaction is only through tapping, while net is also available through inserting of card and keying in the pin. While i repeatedly mention alot of times, to do that, she still keep saying my card is invalid and my card is a credit card and cannot be used for nets. Until i need to visible show her to insert the card into the device for net payment

I like how Dr Aaron Singh treat my daughter on her first visit which was very pleasant. Until yesterday 7/8/24, when Dr Ng Yau Tung made her traumatize as he did influenza swab test and also covid swab test. By the way, my daughter only had slight fever and cough and why all these unnecessary test to a 2yo toddler. We have the Blue CHAS card which means we come from a low income household and we should be inform of the charges. In the end, we were charged $131.00 and they didn't even give the breakdown of the charges. I will never be coming back if the doctor is not Dr Aaron, Dr Ng is a NO NO. No wonder the clinic was quite empty yesterday.

Please read - A nasal swab for H1N1 testing will be conducted for your child if he or she is deemed to be at higher risk for a more severe H1N1 virus.

Dr Aaron is super attentive, caring, and friendly; and I believe his heart for his patients is what every doctor should have. I would always request for him when I visit the clinic, despite the longer waiting time. I have also given a 5 stars review previously for the experience I had with Dr Aaron and most of the recep/counter staff (very helpful and friendly too!).

However, on 2 separate occasions, I had been assigned Dr Ng Yau Tung and Dr Lau Khang Yean as Dr Aaron was not on duty. The experiences differ vastly from my other experiences in this clinic, and I was utterly disappointed. They dismissed my symptoms and nonchalantly did physical checks for me. Although I had gotten medications that were helpful, I felt that these doctors lack professionalism and I would appreciate if the management could look into it as I believe I’m not the only one who feels this way.

FAITH Healthcare (Rivervale) Clinic,1,"My son had fever and flu yesterday, therefore need to consult doctor for medical certification. He went to FAITH Healthcare (Rivervale) for doctor consultation, the doctor advised him to take influenza swab and prescribed him with 8 medicines.   This caused him a bill of $152, unbelievable!

Despite my son has informed the doctor that he went to Polyclinic on the day before (Saturday) and he was prescribed with flu and sore throat medicines from the poly doctor, the doctor from FAITH still prescribed him with flu and sore throat medicines, which I find that is unnecessary.  Or that’s how the clinic charges the patient with a hefty sum without considering the financial capability of the patient?

Secondly, the receipt from the clinic is without any breakdown of line items charges, just showing a single line of charge for $152.  There is no transparency and the itemized bill will only be presented upon request.

I suggest the residents at Rivervale to request a detailed bill and check on the charges before you make any payment.",2024-10-14T04:54:45.681Z,healthcare
Northshore Family Clinic (Punggol Point),1,"Unpleasant experience with the clinic's queue management.
I was the first in line waiting for the clinic to open at 8.30am.
The staff came on time at 8.30am but were not ready to open so I was seated outside with another male patient waiting to be called in.

However after completing their setup, the staff did not even bother to inform us that they have opened for operation and we are only aware when an elderly woman cut queue by barging in straight into the clinic.

I was assigned #2 (despite being first in line) while the male patient was #3. The lady who cut queue was initially assigned to #4 but after pressuring the nurse, she was given #1 instead.

I can understand that the staff may move patient up the queue for medical emergency, but when patient #1 arrived (a child with her two parents, the elderly lady who pressured the nurse came earlier than them to get a queue number), she was clearly not in any medical emergency and it appears that they just want to get attended quickly at the expense of others with the nurses facilitating.

Then when queue #2 (me) was called in, the doctor mistaken me for another patient #3 which turns out have been moved up to my queue by one of the nurse as he was complaining. But I stood my ground since I had already given my first spot to another patient and would not accept being pushed to the back of the queue.

in summary:
- Me --> #2 even though first in line, subsequently moved to #3
- Male patient --> #3, subsequently moved to #2 for no reason
- Elderly lady --> #4, moved to queue #1 after pressuring nurses.

Lastly I was prescribed a medication with only around 1 year to expiration out of it's 3 years manufacturing lifecycle, but was told that it's the only batch they have and I was left with no choice but to take it.

I hope the management will look into this issue seriously and make improvements.",2025-08-21T01:46:06.144Z,healthcare

Nurse at the reception called to give medication after consult and during the first medication given I noticed there were instructions that she missed out saying on the box (it says take once daily and then start with 2 tablets at the last line) so I clarified with her and she answered super impatiently and said all information on the box (basically asking me to read and comprehend it myself). I responded by telling her that it's medication and therefore I would like for it to be explained properly especially when it comes to dosage. She proceeded to answer super impatiently to say ""okay what is it that you want"" and then proceed to rush through the remaining medication and blocked the instructions so I could not ask anymore questions. Before I left, I shared with her my feedback - in which I told her that while I understand the clinic is busy, I do not think the level of service should be compromised especially when it comes to medication and explaining the dosage etc. and guess what, she just replied okay and did not even apologize or make sure she went through the medications again.

"Parkway Shenton Medical Clinic, Guoco Tower",1,"The medical staff is fine and efficient, the customer service is really unprofessional and lacks basic knowledge of how to deal with patients.

TLDR, Be prepared to wait even if you have an appointment. I mentioned to the staff that I was in a rush when checking in and had an appointment at 11.10am, and I even checked if the waiting time for a blood test would be long because I would have come back another day if so. The staff told me for blood test it should be fine since most people were here for a full health checkup. I also know that it’s a quick procedure so decided to wait.

I had to wait over an hour for a simple blood test that was over in less than 5 mins, and I had to go up to the front desk multiple times to check on the status on my appointment. I wouldn’t have been so frustrated if I had just been told to expect a long waiting time - to make it worse, the front desk staff communicated to each other in Chinese (within full earshot of all customers btw) that because I’m not seeing a doctor and just doing a blood test, that’s why my number got de-prioritized and I “should’ve come early to draw blood”. I appreciate that one of two of them was trying to expedite things for me, but it was really frustrating and annoying.

Just some simple communication would’ve change the experience entirely. Will be avoiding this clinic unless I have no choice.",2025-08-11T05:01:28.404Z,healthcare

Or osteoporosis or mensicus tear? Will my recovery be long? Do i need operation? Questions going through my mind. Anyway i like this doctor and his clinic because no need to wait an eternity to get a diagnosis and medications. Dr Lee referral me to SGH for further tests and his staff followed up within the day for an appointment within the week. Very efficient.

Bridgepoint Health (Everton Park Clinic),1,"I've always had a wonderful experience at A Medical, but today was a disappointment with Bridgepoint Health with the new doctor Dr. Siva.

I went in for a simple issue, pain in my thumb. Dr. Siva talked a lot on how he doesn't know insurance and what to claim and suggest that I go hand surgeon... He did not tell me if he's going to prescribe me anything to treat the pain or diagnose what my issue is.  He just referred me to a hand surgeon.

When I asked who he suggest I can see, he said the panel on my insurance doctor. I told him, can he give me some recommended surgeons so I can check if they are on my insurance panel.... He then asked me to wait, I waited for 10mins and he brought another doctor in to explain and who assured me that he will recommend me a doctor and advised me to check if they are in my insurance panel. That was exactly what I had asked for!!

To my shock and horror, Dr. Siva then charged me EXTENDED consult WITHOUT informing me. I only realized it when I paid.

Maybe he knew I was claiming, it is very irresponsible that he told me to wait in the room and then charged me extra for long time WITHOUT informing.

I will not pursue this as I am claiming this from travel insurance but I have to provide this feedback. I have been with A Medical for years since they opened, but this has been very UNPLEASANT.

It makes me question the ethics of doctors... Whether they are here to treat patients or to get paid more for their time.",2025-04-09T07:10:20.037Z,healthcare

Bridgepoint Health (Everton Park Clinic),3,"This is a great clinic that I found in my neighbourhood recently. The doctors are good, and it has a seamless online booking system. Having said that, its queue management process has a big room for improvement, hence I only put 3 stars.

I made an appointment and was at the clinic yesterday, yet the queue was 45 minutes long before it was my toddler's turn. Because she was unwell, she became tireless and was crying non stop after the long wait. It was unnecessarily stressful for me onsite as a parent.

Today, I headed down to the clinic as I was also not feeling well myself. Despite that I made a booking on the system for 4.15pm slot, made an effort to be punctual, the nurse registered me and confirmed that I am the next one to go in .... I was unexpectedly stopped to go in at the last minute. This was because a man appeared at the counter after me to register himself, and the nurse said he should go in first as his booking was 4pm which was before mine (4.15pm).

This is the part that buffles me. The previous patient was late for his reserved time slot, and I made an effort to be on time for mine, yet my turn gets pushed out even if the late comer comes in physically later than me in the clinic. This process gives no incentive for patients to make accurate appointment booking in the system and make effort to be punctual. Does that mean next time I should just randomly book an early time slot and come later, since I will still be prioritised at the clinic? I explained to the nurse, but I was dismissed, she did not understand where I was coming from.

After being failed by the seemingly-good online booking system, my confidence for this clinic has dropped significantly. I was intending to make this clinic my family clinic in the long run, but I don't think I can afford the unjustified long waiting time for every subsequent visit. I hope the management can look into the matter to regain patients' confidence for this promising clinic in the neighbourhood.",2025-01-24T09:18:33.649Z,healthcare

Chung & Ee Medical Clinic,5,"Recommendations by a friend of mine for my weeks of post flu persistent cough. Cough especially is a nightmare, I had not have a good night since and it’s taking its toll on my mental clarity. The nurses, which I read from earlier reviews got negative comments- I am new and first time to this clinic I would say at start they are more aloof, and the mannerism they speak may not be the norm societal expected gentle ‘mi see’ tone but I would like to be fair to say- they are still professional who gets their job done- registrating for me and taking my BP before seeing Dr. And a grandma w walking difficulties walked in for a vac jab and one of the nurse hurried to ask her to sit down and instead of going to the room, she brought the jab for her to be done at the general area. I think there is still compassion. I have no bad comments about them, in fact when I was out to collect meds- it was mutual courteous exchange of convo (keyword here is: mutual) and we even chatted saying that the wave of flu and cough and wish each other good health.

Dr Chung, not to be missed. He is patient and detailed in explaining the possible cause for my irritation and cough. Asked for my medical history, whether I was on any long term medications. I was thankful for the experience. I have taken my meds twice today and not heard a cough.

I have been visiting Dr Chung for close to 3 years. He has been monitoring my BP and my medication. Recently I had some chest discomfort but was releuctant to go for further tests. Dr Chung advised me to go for CT scan which I didn’t want to. I opted for a referral to heart centre for me for a follow. Before referral, he advised me to take an ECG at his clinic. The first reading was not good. He informed me that there is a high chance of a blockage. I was not able to accept this.

I asked to take ECG for a second time. He kindly obliged and the results were the same. I followed his advise and the next day went for further tests and found out that I had a severe blockage and did angioplasty. Not to mention that my ECG at Mount Elizabeth was also normal. The cardiologist asked what is the issue as my ECG is normal. Then I showed the readings taken at Dr Chung. Then we went for further test.

Chung & Ee Medical Clinic,1,"The attitude of the nurses here is extremely poor, and they are very disdainful. It cost over $100 for a child to see a doctor, and we hoped to split the payment into two days, paying over $50 today and the rest tomorrow. However, the nurse was very disdainful and even used derogatory language. She speaks the Hokkien dialect ""SIAO"". Her attitude seemed to suggest that if we couldn't afford it, we shouldn't come to see the doctor at all.

We spent over $100 for a single doctor's visit, and all we wanted was to split the payment over two days. We haven't shortchanged you in any way. Why should we be treated with disrespect? Why should we be looked down upon? Why can't we split the payment for the medication over two days? And why can't we have an invoice for the medication on the same day it's given?

The nurse's attitude was extremely disdainful, and she used derogatory language. Her attitude seemed to suggest that if we couldn't afford it, we shouldn't come to see the doctor at all.

Cavenagh Medical Clinic and Home Care,5,"Just wanted to drop a thank you to Dr Teng and the team at Cavenagh Medical for their professionalism and good service. We've been seeing Dr Teng since my son was born in June 2023, because we were looking for a kind doctor who could administer vaccines smoothly and not cause unnecessary distress (we had a bad experience at a polyclinic nearby). Dr Teng is one of those rare GPs who can give my son 3 jabs quickly and smoothly, soothe my son with a sticker or two and have him laughing. My husband and I have also seen Dr Teng for the occasional flu and were happy with the treatment. My helper also saw him for her health checkup and remarked that his drawing of blood was so painless.

The front desk team can be easily contacted by Whatsapp to arrange appointments, and they have actually REMINDED me when I forget that my son has a vaccination coming up. Not sure why others have had negative experiences with appointments, but we've always seen the doctor less than +/-30 mins of our appointment time on Mondays/Tuesdays. If you  need to wait, the clinic is spacious, clean and has toys for kids up and down the hall too.",2024-10-07T03:38:00.104Z,healthcare
Cavenagh Medical Clinic and Home Care,1,"My helper went to the clinic to seek help for her cough.  After consultation, her invoice came out to be $81.70 and she had not enough $50 to pay for the bill.  The clinic wanted my helper to contact me,  she can’t really explain well about not enough money.  The admin lady Ms See,  collected from her $50 for consultation but wanted her to come back with the balance of $31.70 for the medication.  When she came back without medication, I called up the clinic, asking why they didn’t bother to call me to inform me on this? I can simply transfer the different to them.  They  just cant let the patient who is not well, seek help from the doctor and  leave the clinic without medication.  This don’t make any sense,",2024-09-16T10:55:29.585Z,healthcare

Cavenagh Medical Clinic and Home Care,1,"I visited the clinic on August 12, 2024, arriving at 4:25 PM, well before their stated closing time of 5:00 PM. To my disappointment, I was informed that the clinic was no longer accepting new patients and that registration had closed. This was particularly frustrating as I had planned my visit based on the published closing time.

While I understand that unforeseen circumstances can occur, it is crucial for a clinic to adhere to its posted hours or to communicate any changes clearly to avoid such inconvenience. Patients rely on these hours to plan their visits, and not honoring them or providing clear updates can cause unnecessary frustration and stress.

I hope this feedback helps the clinic address these issues and improve their service in the future. For now, I would advise potential visitors to confirm operating hours directly with the clinic before planning their visit.",2024-08-12T08:52:04.332Z,healthcare

Cavenagh Medical Clinic and Home Care,1,"I’m highly disappointed by the clinic service. This clinic doesn’t operate per their opening hour stated on Google nor what’s app auto response. This is extremely misleading and inconvenient for patients who rely on those opening hour to make a decision about if they should rush to another clinic, hospital or wait for the clinic to open. It’s not a one time occurrence that the clinic is not open during its supposedly opening hours, it’s multiple times. Also, the clinic never responds on time via WhatsApp about the change in opening hours. As a clinic, you don’t operate by whim, you are there to provide a service for patients who stay in the neighbourhood. If one doctor cannot make it, you can have backup doctors. If you don’t operate during certain days, that’s fine, but the very basic thing you can do is to at least change that in Google or website or WhatsApp auto response so that it doesn’t not mislead patients.",2024-06-23T10:39:29.023Z,healthcare

Cavenagh Medical Clinic and Home Care,5,"Dr. Marissa Chua is a remarkable physician who goes above and beyond for her patients. From the moment I walked into her office, I felt welcomed and cared for.

I visited her for an annual health screening, blood test, and a flu vaccination. She patiently took the time to listen attentively to my concerns, and helping me to customize the health screening package that was relevant and affordable for my needs. She’s indubitably driven by what her patient needs and definitely not in the business of making a quick profit. For instance, like any patient who thought doing more tests is better as it’s more comprehensive, she actually advised me to opt out certain unnecessary costly tests that were not needed for my age and condition.

Her expertise and dedication to her craft were evident in every interaction, instilling confidence and trust in her care. My flu vaccination was a breeze and wasn’t painful at all.

I left her clinic feeling empowered and reassured, knowing that I was in capable hands. What impressed me the most was her genuine follow-ups post the medical appointment, giving gentle nudges and checking in on the progress of my diet and exercise plan.

I cannot recommend Dr. Marissa Chua highly enough for anyone seeking exceptional medical care. Thank you for being such a gem; you are surely my go to for my healthcare needs!",2024-05-08T12:12:35.474Z,healthcare

Third time, arrived when no one was there, no queue number given, the receptionist told me I was first in the queue. After 1 hour wait, another receptionist told me I was the last in the queue coz the 2 came after me had appointment. The receptionists don’t know the rules and don’t know if there are appointments.

"Parkway Shenton Medical Clinic, Punggol Oasis",1,"I brought my NS son to Parkway Shenton Oasis this morning and, unfortunately, had a very unpleasant experience with this clinic. Before coming, I had already read some negative reviews about this clinic and was slightly concerned, but since this clinic is near our home, we decided to give it a try.
There were two doctors on duty and the queue moved fairly quickly, so we thought things would be smooth. However, when it was our turn, Dr Koh’s very first question was whether my son was an NS personnel. The moment we said yes, he immediately remarked, “Why not go and see the MO instead of coming here?” His tone and body language suggested that we were wasting his time. It felt as though he had already judged my son as someone trying to “chao keng” (skive), instead of treating him as a genuine patient who was unwell.
We had to explain ourselves further before he reluctantly began his examination. Throughout, his attitude seemed dismissive and unempathetic. While he did eventually issue a one-day MC, the entire consultation left us feeling belittled and uncomfortable—completely unnecessary for a patient who is already unwell.
On a positive note, the receptionist, Xin Yi, was professional, friendly and approachable. Her good service was the only saving grace of our visit and helped lighten the experience.
That said, we will not be returning to this clinic in the future, even if it means travelling further. A patient deserves to be treated with respect and empathy, not with suspicion or disdain.",2025-08-26T01:12:30.787Z,healthcare

Silver Cross Medical (Holland),5,"Silver Cross Clinic in Holland Village has been my go-to general practitioner for several years now, and I continue to be impressed by the consistently high standard of care provided. The clinic is run by a male and a female doctor, both of whom are not only highly competent but also incredibly patient, kind, and thorough in their consultations.

What truly sets them apart is the genuine care and attention they give to each patient. Whether it’s a routine check-up or a more complex health concern, they take the time to listen carefully and explain things clearly, without rushing. I’ve witnessed them handle difficult or impatient patients with calm professionalism and empathy—something not all clinics manage well.

Despite the clinic often being busy, especially during peak hours, the waiting time remains quite reasonable considering the quality of service. I usually go early in the morning, just as they open, to be among the first, which I’ve found to be a good strategy if you're on a tight schedule.

It’s clear that both doctors are dedicated to maintaining a high level of service, and their consistency over time is something I truly value. In an age where many clinics feel rushed or impersonal, Silver Cross stands out as a place where patients are genuinely cared for.

If you're looking for a trustworthy and compassionate GP in the Holland Village area, I highly recommend Silver Cross Clinic. You’ll be in good hands.",2025-05-26T03:17:24.993Z,healthcare

Silver Cross Medical (Holland),1,"I had a very disappointing experience at this clinic. I brought my child in who was running a fever, had a runny nose, and a persistent cough. I had to leave work early to get him medical attention. Upon arrival, the staff registered us and told us to wait. After about 30 minutes, I was informed that the doctor had ended her shift at 4pm (it was already 4:04pm), and that the locum doctor taking over could not see children.

I was extremely frustrated — not only had we been sitting there waiting with a sick toddler, but no one informed us about the change in doctor or the fact that the next doctor wouldn’t be able to help. When I asked what could be done, the receptionist simply told me to come back tomorrow. That’s not a solution when a young child is unwell.

This level of miscommunication and lack of professionalism is unacceptable, especially in a healthcare setting. I sincerely hope the clinic takes steps to improve their processes and patient communication moving forward.",2025-05-14T03:26:12.121Z,healthcare

Why can’t speak to the doctor seen by me, he is a part timer doctor is no fault of me. Other doctor on duty  in the clinic explained that it is unethical for him to issue MC on his behalf. What nonsense! Want money just say so. $45.78 consultation fee during days time is not cheap.

I went to the clinic again on 17 April at about 4 plus in the afternoon. The doctor who attended me was a locum, an Indian lady.  I asked politely for a memo and to seek further treatment as the pain and numbness did not improve.  She raised her voice at me , was not compassionate and did not show empathy at all!

The experience with the doctor was another story. I was at the clinic on 25/2 (5pm) He looks younger than me but i have never seen a grumpier young man.

He interrogated me on why i was at this clinic rather than another clinic. I dont see how that is related to the condition I was at the clinic for. I told him nicely but he didnt seem satisfied with the response.

Maybe he woke up on the wrong side of bed. But i asked him if i could get a steriod jab for my hives outbreak. He told me that it only works for localized area. I told him that i had gotten it before 18 years ago for this condition. He told me that 'whether i get it depends on whether the doctor is willing to give it to you, and you can go travel until you can find someone willing'. Then i asked him, so does it mean i get the jab? He said no. But he said he can give me additional steriods. He said that he usually doesnt give because of side effects. Since there was side effects, i asked him, then 'should i even take?' He asked me, 'am i the doctor, or are you the doctor?' And 'if it wasnt worth taking it i wouldnt recommend it'. Then i asked him 'so what about the side effects?' he said 'anyway the side effects are very mild.' He started to look offended and cross.

I cannot understand this guy, im having anxiety from having rashes over my whole body, but when i ask him questions, he says contradicting things, that i dont understand what kind of point he is making, and when i ask him to clarify he makes defensive statements like that??

Then he looked at my record, and i can literally see his jaw clench. And he said, anyway you have everything that you can possibly need so im not even going to give you anything today. So what are you here for today??

I told him im having flu. He said ok, so cough, sorethroat, running nose? I say yes, but no cough. He said ok.

When i went out to collect medicine. I had cough medicine? I cannot understand this man. He just told me 'if you dont need it, i wouldnt recommend it to you' but here he is giving me cough medicine even though i told him that i dont have cough?

I told the front desk, then i stood there for a couple of mins. The front desk guy was quite nice. But nothing happened. I asked the guy what i was waiting for. He said, for the doctor to reply. I was like ???? I just dont need the cough medicine, why do i need to wait for the doctor? Can i go? He said ok and i left.

After he quick fired all the questions he wanted to get through, he just told me he will order tests to be done without explaining the rationale. He only impatiently answered my questions after further probing from me. He made me feel like I was just another one of his “tasks” to get done and over with.

Healthway Medical (Jurong West Central),5,"Visited the clinic for a medical examination and my experience was very pleasant!

Interaction with the nurse at the reception was a pleasure, as she was professional, patient and spoke with a gentle tone. There was another nurse working at the reception as well that I did not interact with directly, but was working in a professional manner as well; dealing with phone calls and speaking in a very amiable tone.
Both individuals were doing an excellent job keeping a peaceful and calm environment despite having ~7-8 people patients in the waiting room at any given time, they kept the flow moving smoothly.

During the medical examinations itself, both the reception nurse that was assisting - as well as the female doctor were thoughtful and sensitive in the way they spoke/handled me as a patient. I believe that that level of professionalism is priceless in the healthcare sector - as being a patient is a vulnerable experience.

The entire appointment lasted for a little over an hour, which was very reasonable - all factors put into consideration.

Overall, the clinic floor run by efficient and compassionate women is indeed a powerhouse in my book.

Bliss Medical Clinic,1,"This is for the rude clinic assistant who sat near to the door to consultation room. Both her tone and interaction was nothing blissful but out right uncouth and disrespectful. It seemed she has particular dislike of patient  that was covered under Fullerton. I was asked to walked up to her for showing the e-card, taking temperature and registered each time after I walked back and seated. Why can’t all these done at one time?  Since I was the only person she attended and another assistant was helping her. The last task i.e. registering for co.’s medical coverage, she told me to “sign” but when I couldn’t find where she want me to sign, she rebutted: “sign mean write down everything then sign lah.  You should know what! Come before!”

My last visit was months back not yesterday. Just imagine you are already unwell and had to suck up her bad attitudes…made you decided that it may  be well your last visit.

And to be fair, the male doctor is a good doctor who displayed due professionalism and care. But not sure enough to remediate the bliss-less experience that were rendered first.",2023-12-11T05:36:07.472Z,healthcare

Bliss Medical Clinic,2,Bad attitude of phone reception,2023-08-17T08:57:38.064Z,healthcare
Bliss Medical Clinic,1,"was feeling really sick and groggy. walked into the clinic to take a number, there was only 6 people area and the receptionist named “cindy”, straight away said for me to take a seat before i could even told her my name and wait for her to finish dispense the medicine before giving me a q number so i did so as i understand she was the only one that was manning the counter and she may be busy.

i waited for her for 15mins for her to organise her items properly and then 2 new patients walked in and her attitude changed and she was about to serve the customer in front with a number. of course, i stood up and told her i came first as i have been waiting eagerly for my turn so i could wait to go home and rest. when i told her that her attitude blacken and suddenly she said when did you came? did you came to the counter? kind of accusing me as if i didn’t even check in with her previously or i am deliberately cutting someone else’s queue. but that was okay, i could let that slide.

the 2nd thing i can’t let slide was when she served me after i told her i came first, with no respect and PDPA discrepancy, she yell out my IC number so loud without any respect to the PDPA clause. she literally yell it loud till the rest of other patient in the clinic could hear it. and she even accused me of giving her the wrong IC number so rudely. her service towards me was so disrespectful and unprofessional, it doesn’t feel good for someone that’s already sick and just want to see the doctor. i think she could do so much better if she wants to do front-line.

the doctor is superb, only the receptionist was really rude.",2023-05-09T02:47:24.531Z,healthcare

International Medical Clinic - Camden,5,"Dr. Felice Soo has helped me a great deal in getting through things, both in my personal and professional life. She ticked all of the green flags that I looked for in a therapist:
- I felt safe, Felice has clear and safe boundaries,
- there is space for humor (sorry that you had to cope with all my dad jokes and puns),
- you’ve shown cultural competence and openness in addressing ANY topic,
- she listened to my feedback, which made me feel validated.

International Medical Clinic - Camden,2,"I visited this clinic for a regular body screening for the first time last year July. So This is an overdue review.
I bought a specific package with clear price on their website. After completing the tests, I was made to go through an unnecessary questionnaire with the doctor about my health and childhood vaccination history — most of which I couldn’t answer, and it felt like a waste of time.

When I went to pay, I was shocked to find a consultation fee of $375 added on top of the package I had signed up for. This was charged without my consent, and I found the fee completely unjustified for the value provided. The lack of transparency in their pricing is very disappointing. I will never return and would not recommend this clinic to others.",2025-08-12T14:54:13.775Z,healthcare

International Medical Clinic - Camden,5,"I had my medical exam with Dr. Kym Chew today, and I honestly couldn’t have asked for a better experience. I was pretty nervous going in, but she was so warm and approachable that it felt more like chatting with a friend than being in a doctor’s office. She explained everything clearly and made sure I was comfortable the entire time.

My appointment was scheduled for 2:00 PM, but she was very prompt and actually saw me earlier at 1:30 PM and attended my appointment early, which I really appreciated. Everything was so well-organized and smooth.

I also want to give a big shout-out to the nurses who took my blood. Even though I have tricky veins, they were so patient and reassuring. They never once made me feel embarrassed or uncomfortable. Instead, they kept checking in, apologizing for any difficulty, and making sure I was okay.

Overall, this clinic goes above and beyond with their care and professionalism. If you’re preparing for your medical exam, I highly recommend coming here. You’ll be treated with kindness and respect every step of the way.",2025-07-08T12:09:10.451Z,healthcare

Thanks for looking after all of my family Dr Lee.",2025-01-10T23:56:43.185Z,healthcare
Health Partners Medical Clinic (Raffles Place),2,"I visited this clinic today because I’ve been experiencing occasional sharp pain in my rectal area, and I wasn’t sure if it was hemorrhoids or something more serious. While the registration process was fast and the receptionist was polite and welcoming, my experience with the doctor was quite disappointing.

The doctor seemed impatient, dismissive, and inattentive. When I explained my symptoms—occasional sharp pain in my butt—and mentioned that I suspected hemorrhoids, he asked me twice why I was there, as if I hadn’t just explained it. I had to repeat myself and reiterate that I was worried about hemorrhoids and wanted treatment if necessary.

When he asked how long I’d been having these symptoms, I said about a month. His response coupled with his facial expression, “Then why are you only coming today?” felt accusatory, as though he doubted my symptoms or my intentions for seeking care. I also mentioned that I sometimes notice blood in my stool, to which he replied, “Just now you said you didn’t have blood in your stool,” which i did not say i didn’t have blood in my stool, revealing that he wasn’t fully paying attention to what I was saying.

When I asked whether the issue would resolve completely with medication, his answer was a curt, “I don’t know.” When I expressed concern about whether it could be something serious, like colon cancer, his response was, again, “I don’t know.” I understand that not every question has an immediate answer, but there’s a more professional way to communicate uncertainty without making a patient feel dismissed.

A quick rectal examination was done, and the doctor mentioned that if symptoms persist, he would refer me to a specialist for a more thorough examination. However, what I don’t understand is why the doctor was so rude and impatient when I had already made it clear why I was there—to address rectal pain and check for hemorrhoids.

Overall, this experience left me feeling unheard, dismissed, and dissatisfied with the care provided. Patients come to a clinic because they are worried about their health and need help, not to feel belittled or brushed off. I hope the clinic takes this feedback seriously and ensures a more professional and empathetic approach from its doctors in the future.",2024-12-04T04:59:13.788Z,healthcare

I told the doctor, Damien Lee, when I arrived at the clinic that I had hurt my leg, but he never even looked at the condition of my feet; instead, he presumed I had a bunion and gave me painkillers and muscle relaxants without asking me to have an x-ray. I initially told him that I tripped on the carpet and I was able to maintain my equilibrium without falling, but I also told him that I had hurt a joint. Not professional at all, even when I ask the doctor where the location of x-ray is, he doesn't seem to care to response.

I have yet to hear from him about whether the x-ray was successful. What kind of service is he giving if he doesn't check the condition of my feet?

I went to see a doctor cause flu symptom. He listened to half of what i said and make me repeat again. He was more interested in his whatsapp chat then listening to his patient. So i got irritated.
Okay maybe he uses whatsapp to communicate with his peers but still... it is very no professional.
Then the secretary.. they never smile !!! And critics when a patient need to revuew the doctor. ..
They do not think of how their behaviour affect their patient.
I really feel like in this cabinet, they do their job just to got money but i dont see any kind of love in their job. It is pretty sad. The worst is the doctor who is more interested in his phone then his patient.

I previously visited this clinic when it was called Asia First Medical Clinic, and my experience was very disappointing. The doctors seemed unprofessional, and simple check-up items like height and blood pressure were charged at unreasonably high rates. The nurses were not skilled at drawing blood—finding veins was difficult and painful. One male doctor, who was tall and slim and had some difficulty moving around, appeared to delay issuing test reports to encourage patients to undergo additional tests in their clinic with unreasonable prices. Moreover, if you choose to have tests done outside their clinic, they charge extra high fees, seemingly to pressure you into opting for those overpriced and non-transparent tests within their facility. The clinic also charges many miscellaneous fees, with no clear explanation or transparency. I don’t understand why they suddenly changed their name; it feels like an attempt to escape a poor reputation. I strongly advise caution before choosing this clinic.",2025-08-11T18:38:14.739Z,healthcare

Minmed Clinic (Jurong East),1,"Came to redo a urine test after a health screening with Minmed. When I did the online teleconsult with a Dr, he asked me to just redo the urine test with a dipstick test. Concerned about the cost, I asked how much it would be and he said $12. However when I went to the outlet, I was told that I have to see the dr on duty for consultation first before I can redo my urine test, and that was chargeable. Feels quite ridiculous and scammy that I have to pay to consult another Dr when I already spoke to a Dr on teleconsult.
But I went ahead with it anyway and the dr on duty said that he will recommend me to do the lab test instead of dipstick. He explained why and I said ok. Again, I enquired about the cost so as not to get any shock. He said it was about $12 and I could check the actual amount at the front desk.
The front desk then passed me the pee sample bottle and told me that the test & consult will be $100+. I was shocked but eventually had to agree to it since I was already there and they checked with the dr who insisted on the lab test. Disappointing experience as the dr should be better informed and more transparent on prices. $12 vs $100 is very different. Minmed should review the unnecessary step of 2 dr consults. Also, it is concerning that there is a disparity on the tests that different doctors are ordering.",2025-08-08T06:54:09.600Z,healthcare

Minmed Clinic (Jurong East),1,"Terrible terrible service.
Scheduled an appointment for vaccine and I arrived on time to clinic. 2 uninterested clinic assistants attended to me. The simple explanation is vaccine did not arrive and is ‘ on the way’. The lady by the name of Sha has poor communication skills. Despite the fact that I look all confused and flustered, she clearly is very short with her answers.
I asked her why no one called to informed that the vaccine was not in yet and someone should ask me not to come. She said vaccine is on the way. I asked when and she said it is on the way and asked me not to shout at her. At no time did I shout at her.
I again raised the questions on why no one called me. Instead she told me that someone also came for vaccine in the morning and can’t do it as the vaccine was not in yet.
The clear question at this point is that they should inform patients who set up appointment not to come until the vaccine is in the clinic. She again replied that vaccine is on the way.
This kind of evasive attitude is clearly irresponsible and unprofessional.
I told her that I want her name and the HQ number.
She said she did not have the HQ number and asked me to go online to get it. When I refused to do that, she asked her colleague to attend to me when her colleague was talking to another patient.
I have been going to Minmed for vaccine and clearly I won’t go again.

I was only given normal olive oil ear drops and a week supply of antibiotics, despite the doctor informing that he would provide another ear drop with antibiotics. the bill came up to be a hefty $45 + $10. The malay receptionist was extremely rude. on 20th June, they came back and demanded me to pay another $22.85 and only to correct themselves and claim that the bill is $12.85.

I suffered more than 1 week without proper ear drops and situation did not improve. Luckily the second time, i made the right choice not to go back to them and visited another trusted clinic. This time, my trusted doctor at another clinic told me that i was given old and less effective antibiotics.

I asked her what’s the approximate waiting time and she told me 20minutes. So I sat there and waited. In between, more people registered (they do not have prior appt as the receptionist asked during registration and they were given queue numbers from 60 onwards). They proceeded to call for queue numbers up to 64, letting me wait there while people who just came got called before me. It was also already 6.47pm by then and I went to ask the receiptionist why were people coming and registering after me seeing the doctor first. She told me queue numbers would not be called in sequence. I’m ok with it not being called in sequence as I understand that there might also be others who might have made prior appt beforehand but there were none during the duration while I was in the clinic.

When I arrived at the clinic today, the counter staff informed me that this branch does not have X-ray facilities and suggested that I go to the Jurong Point branch instead to complete the full check-up (blood test + X-ray), since I would be heading there anyway.

This information was not clearly stated during the online booking process. The website only mentions that X-ray services are available on weekdays from 9am–5pm, but does not indicate that this branch does not offer X-ray at all. If such a crucial part of the check-up isn’t available at the location, it should have been made very clear during appointment booking.

Unity Medical Clinic,5,"I was nearby when i decided to drop by the clinic to get my blood pressure medicine. To my surprise, the doctor and nurse were really pleasant. The doctor could have just gave me my med and not care more but he did. He checked my med history and gave suggestions on how i can improve on my health. And also shared some tips on using the smart watch to track my workout. The Indian nurse has the friendliest smile too.",2025-06-10T13:00:34.814Z,healthcare

Will not recommend, as this will be my first and last visit!",2025-01-01T04:17:11.024Z,healthcare

Unity Medical Clinic,1,"Unacceptable Service Standards and Appointment Scheduling Failure!

I received a call from Unity Clinic’s staff confirming an appointment for me at 11:00 am today for a review of my blood test and stool test results.

However, upon my arrival, I was told that there was no record of my appointment in the system. Adding to my dismay, there was not even a doctor present at the clinic.

My partner, who had been to Unity clinic for similar tests, had already shared her concerns about the poor service standards at their front desk.

I was skeptical, but today’s experience left me with no choice but to acknowledge it firsthand. This is, quite frankly, the worst level of service I have ever encountered in a medical setting.

As a patient, one expects professionalism, reliability, and organization, particularly in a clinic where people trust their health and time to the Unity clinic.

I would advise anyone making a visit or booking to confirm not once, but twice or even three times before coming.",2024-10-27T03:19:31.899Z,healthcare
