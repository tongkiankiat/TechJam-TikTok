COURTS Orchard,5,Thanks Hari for the impeccable service and great help - made the shopping experience  an exceptional one!,2025-08-17T04:50:03.856Z,retail
COURTS Orchard,1,"Visited Courts Nojima on 3 August to explore buying a dryer. Did not expect it to be the start of many troubles.

Was wrongly advised by sales staff regarding the SG60 discounts ($120 off instead of $60) and use of climate vouchers for a dryer (cannot be used) only at the point of purchase. Decided to proceed with buying the Samsung dryer.

After purchase, did not receive any confirmation of notification of delivery of actual date, only a call 10 mins before delivery. Delivery window was 10am to 2pm, and ended up staying home for 3 hours (10am to 1pm) before getting a call that the delivery was coming. Sales staff also was hard to contact regarding delivery (2 to 3h wait, only responded after calling). Understand it was his off day, but Courts should have a staff to cover for him since it still involved deliveries, or have a more contactable number.

Sales staff also wrongly scheduled the Samsung delivery agent, so ended up the agent only came 1 day after the dryer was delivered. Asked for a specific time for the agent to come (3pm) to make up for the mistake but ended up with delaying my delivery window (originally 2 to 6pm) to 3 to 7pm. As of 545pm, the agent is still not here. (Edit: Agent ended up being late, and I was forced to take cab to my appointment)

This is one of my worst sales service to date, from pre to post sales. The only good things about this whole process was the advice given on the right dryer to buy (pre sales) and the free delivery given in an attempt to recover from the mistake in the supposed discount.

Please work on your service processes and sales recovery. It is alarming how poor the standards are.",2025-08-14T11:17:37.270Z,retail

COURTS Orchard,5,"I initially went to Courts Orchard to check out a few items for my new home. I was assisted by Max, who struck me as a very patient and knowledgeable salesperson. He took the time to answer all my questions over the course of more than two hours and demonstrated extensive knowledge of various electrical appliances. Max also offered helpful tips on how to make the most of my purchases and save money at Courts. He also was very flexible in arranging for the payment terms which best fit my needs. Ultimately, I decided to go ahead with the purchase of a Samsung Smart TV and a Samsung Home Theatre system. Highly recommend speaking to Max if you're going to Courts Orchard, as he made my entire experience smooth and easy.",2025-06-08T12:20:30.407Z,retail

He patiently explained how the machines worked and how I could easily link it to my phone to remote control it. This is so important to me as I consider myself an IT idiot.
He even took it a step further by giving me his personal number so that I can WhatsApp him if I encounter any problems.
With his detailed explanations n good recommendations,  I easily linked the machines n have done a full load of laundry.

COURTS Orchard,1,"Staff are not very helpful and not knowledgeable about their products and offerings. Even small 7eleven store cashiers are better than these lazy staff.

I bought a camera here that will be used as a gift. No one was around to help, so I went to the cashier area and asked someone to sell the item to me. I specifically asked if the item I will be buying can be returned as I don't want to open the box since it will be a gift I will give on my overseas trip. The guy who helped me said it could be returned after 14 days. I counted my overseas trip days, and if ever there is a defect, I can still return it after my trip.

Armed with this info, I immediately paid for the item. When I double-checked with the cashier about the return policy, much to my surprise, he said the item only has a 1 week return policy. I argued that they falsely provided sales terms and misled me into buying the item. As a compromise, I asked if they could test it instead, though I am hesitant since I want the box sealed when I give my gift - but to add to the incompetence so far, they said they don't have a dedicated salesperson who can test it.

Since they have no solutions for me and we just stared at each other for minutes with no one offering even a simple apology, much less a work around the issue, I just opted to refund the item.

When the person who will process my refund came and asked the guy if I would need a refund, the guy even had the gall to tell her I changed my mind. I didn't let it pass since they are the one who changed the terms of sale right there, not me. Stores usually get sued and fined for this kind of misleading sales, but the staff are not even bothered by the mistake and incompetence they just displayed. In any other setup, this kind of attitude leads to suspension or even dismissal, but I guess Courts Orchard management is satisfied with being mediocre and incompetent.",2025-02-26T15:34:22.297Z,retail
COURTS Orchard,5,"I am writing to express my heartfelt appreciation for the exceptional service provided by Eric Chang from Courts Orchard.

A year ago, I purchased a laptop and a mobile phone from Courts. Due to some delays in delivery, I added Eric, who was at the cashier counter at the time, to my contacts. Recently, one of the items required repairs, and I was unsure how to proceed. Remembering Eric, I reached out to him with the hope that he could assist me.

To my surprise and delight, despite nearly a year passing since our initial interaction, Eric responded promptly and went above and beyond to help me resolve the issue. His professionalism, patience, and dedication ensured that everything was handled smoothly, leaving me deeply impressed and grateful.

Eric‚Äôs outstanding service is a testament to Courts‚Äô excellent leadership and management. It is clear that your company values and nurtures talented employees who are committed to customer satisfaction. This experience has reinforced my confidence in Courts as the best choice for quality products and reliable service.

Thank you once again for having such an outstanding team member. I truly appreciate Eric‚Äôs help and look forward to continuing my patronage with Courts.",2025-02-19T14:52:48.119Z,retail

Samsung Experience Store,1,"On 10 April 2024, visited the store to fix Zfold4 screen protector lifting off in the middle in less than a year since purchase. Had to pay $30 for a new screen protector as I am not sure if we can do it elsewhere without negating the warranty. It would be free with Samsung Care.

The service was prompt without long queue, fixed within an hour. However, the fix came with a big disclaimer - there will be no warranty on the new protector even if bubbles develop within a few days. What kind of confidence is that coming from the brand?

As a long time user of Samsung for more than a decade, it is appreciated that a free protector was given with the phone. However, to see that the cover failed within a year, I can't help but cast doubts over the longer term reliability of ZFold4. What if the screen starts to crack after the warranty period? I have S8 that is still usable but it would seem that fancy ZFold4 may not last as long.

Recommended to consider Samsung Care.

10 May 2024 - sadly another visit to fix Z Fold 4 is needed. Inner display stopped working. Still within warranty but it is a waste of time. Samsung Care can't be added. Sent in 11am, collected before 4pm. Excellent working condition for now. But 1 Yr warranty expiring next month, can the phone last another year even? Explore trade in options? Clearly fold design  is far from reliable.

5 June 2025: Samsung Z Fold 4 inner screen sudden death! I have used Samsung phones since 2013, even the S8 is still working without issues. How can Samsung sell fold phones that are so unreliable!? It is so expensive to fix it.

August 2025. Pink line across the outer screen. Let's see how bad can zfold4 ends up.",2025-08-22T11:01:15.718Z,retail

Samsung Experience Store,1,"Rushed over to the Samsung Experience Store at Vivocity to get a cover for my new Fold because their opening hours on Google state that they are open till 10pm. Reached there slightly after 9.40pm only to be greeted by closed doors and no lights. Very upset to have made a wasted trip, especially since I rushed over from the Westgate store at their 9pm closing time after being informed that the cover I am looking for was just sold out.

Hope future customers are able to be provided accurate information, instead of wasting their time.

P.S. For friends with a similar experience, there are Samsung covers available at the Best Denki store just a few units away on the same floor, you do not have to purchase from the Samsung store.

Samsung Experience Store,1,Samsung Online Store GROSS MISREPRESENTATION OF STOCK DELIVERY AND INVENTORY. I would avoid buying from Samsung. Bought S25 on Samsung online store and was notified of delayed delivery via SMS. No further follow ups after a week. I had to call into Samsung customer service 3 times on my own to figure out when the delivery would happen. Turned out they didn't figure out their stocks properly and ran OOS of Pink. Was asked to change my phone colour so that the delivery could be arranged. Absolutely no service recovery. I had to recover it for them.

Their customer service (via WhatsApp) is APPALLING. Instant replies from another's phone pretending to be a new customer, but ""bohlayan"" when I tried to claim my warranty. After ranting to ""Desmond"" on WhatsApp, he offered a refund AND a new LCD. I refused because their rabak customer service made me lose all trust. They suddenly claimed my phone had a bloated battery and could damage the screen, wanting to ""check"" it. Sketchy!

LiteMobile needs to prioritize warranty claims and acknowledge issues instead of dismissing them. First and last time customer here. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else!

I‚Äôve never dropped or mishandled the device, so this clearly looks like a manufacturing or assembly defect.

When I went to the Honor service centre, they only applied GX glue to seal the gap. For a premium flagship phone, this is not an acceptable solution ‚Äî especially within such a short time after purchase.

This kind of issue affects build quality, waterproofing, and long-term durability. I expected a proper fix or a replacement, not a quick patch-up job. Honor should stand behind its products, especially when they fail within the Lemon Law period.

To make matters worse, I contacted the HONOR service center via WhatsApp the next day. I was made to wait over two hours for any response, only to be told they were ""busy with another customer."" This level of neglect and disregard for customer time is completely unprofessional.

COURTS Clementi,1,"The unfortunate thing about being a young couple in our early 20s (and looking like a 19yo because of my height and baby face) shopping at an appliance store is that no staff will take us seriously. And that‚Äôs fine. BUT being rude and age discriminative towards us is just overboard.

Just to put it here that we have a BTO that‚Äôll be ready in 2 years‚Äô time. We happened to be at Clementi 321 and Courts is just opposite so we thought it‚Äôd be a good idea to drop by to take a look at the appliances for our future reference.

When we entered the store, a middle aged uncle staff wearing black spectacles already seemed very UNwelcoming of us. That was a bad start to our window shopping experience there.

While we were browsing the fridges, the staff just stood from far and observed us. Which was fine as this is a normal staff behaviour. But after some time, the same staff whom was standing far away, maybe 5-6 fridges away, SHOUTED at us aggressively ‚ÄúWhat you need help with???!‚Äù (please check CCTV and you‚Äôll see exactly what I mean)

That made us really uncomfortable as he shouldn‚Äôt have shouted at us from far. Is it so hard to walk to our proximity and ask us if we need help, like normal, polite staff do? What kind of uncouth and unprofessional behaviour is this?

2nd incident that made me unhappy with the staff‚Äôs attitude was when I was filming the fridges and he stopped me and told me that I‚Äôm not allowed to film in the store. Really‚Ä¶? Then what about all the photos and videos posted on this Google review by other customers? Why was I the exception? Because I looked young and didn‚Äôt have the look of a potential buyer so I was not worthy to film the appliances?

I‚Äôve attached a photo of the staff below. Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt manage to film his name tag clearly, but he was a grumpy looking middle aged uncle wearing black spectacles. Please identify him and give him a stern warning. I‚Äôm sure we were not the only customers who had a bad experience with him.

This unpleasant experience happened on 15 Aug, late afternoon.",2025-08-15T17:09:01.406Z,retail

‚Ä¢ Service: 5/5 (Incredibly friendly and helpful staff)
‚Ä¢ Atmosphere: 4/5 (Clean and organized, inviting atmosphere)
‚Ä¢ Value: 5/5 (Amazing deal on a couple's outfit)

Overall: 5/5

Last week, Donkey and I cycled down to Downtown East for a little exploration. It had been a while since we'd been there, and we wanted to see what was new.  We passed by Bossini and were drawn in by the colorful display of clothes.

I was immediately intrigued by two shirts worn by the mannequins. The guy's shirt featured a big B, and the girl's shirt had a big ""G"" on it.  I thought it was very cute and maybe represented ""boy"" and ""girl"" in fashion, but also the initials of my name. I had been pestering Donkey to get the shirts as a couple wear for a few days.  He didn't want to disappoint me, so we cycled back to Downtown East to get them.

We arrived around 9:30pm, just as the shop was preparing to close.  However, the staff was incredibly friendly and told us to take our time browsing while he did his closing duties. I immediately went for the shirts, and buy them. We was so happy! The shirts cost $23.90 each, but we got a great deal by buying them as a pair for $15.  We chose the ""B&G"" shirts, perfect for us.

Overall, we had a great experience at Bossini. The staff was amazing, the shirts were adorable, and the prices were reasonable.  We'll definitely be back to browse their selection again.",2025-01-10T01:32:43.422Z,retail

The other dress was so thin that can see undergarments although it has inner lining. Doesn‚Äôt match the expensive price tag.
All of the outfits are not entitled for return as they are purchased using store credit.
Very disappointing and this will be my last purchase.",2025-02-07T12:43:17.082Z,retail

MGP Label,1,"Not recommending purchase from here for 2 reasons:

- Quality and cloth materials don‚Äôt justify the price point
- Unhelpful return/exchange T&C for online purchases, especially with inaccurate size guidance

My wife purchased online and followed size guidance on the website but it still didn‚Äôt fit, so we checked for return or exchange, only to find out the items were discounted (might be because a promo code is used), so not eligible for return and even size exchange. Our fault for not reading the T&C first. But, also a TERRIBLE T&C for an online clothing store that sells at a high price point. The worst thing is the cloth materials are super thin, one of them is so thin to a point that it just doesn‚Äôt justify the high price tag.",2024-09-12T02:36:36.747Z,retail

MGP Label,1,"Very poor customer service and customer policy. Not the first time this has happened, was informed a few days after purchase that some of the items I ordered were not available due to an inventory error and was only offered a refund via store credits (not cash refund to original payment mode). Even after expressing my displeasure at how unfair this policy was as the inventory error is the shop‚Äôs fault and certainly not the customers‚Äô fault. When we paid money, we paid for that particular item and not to have it as store credits. They acknowledged what I raised but did not address my concern directly and worst of all, still not offer a cash refund. This is the final straw and is completely unacceptable. Many other better blogshops offer cash refund as an option in such circumstances. I do not wish to patronise them further but now I am stuck with store credits which I will have to use. I see many other reviews here with the same feedback.

Their CS was also unresponsive on WhatsApp and stopped replying my messages after awhile, although I had further questions.

Furthermore. I opted for express delivery but the order took so much longer to reach me since they took a few days to notify me of the inventory error. Totally disappointing. Buy at your own risk!",2024-02-03T08:17:39.443Z,retail

Please be mindful of these dirty tricks that they use when they run out the sizes you ordered.

Update: after many chasers (like what others said in their reviews), I finally got my refund. Wasted a lot of my time as they tend to just ignore your texts and email unless you pester them. Please beware!",2024-01-17T22:32:19.392Z,retail

Skechers Punggol Coast Mall,1,"Feedback on Unpleasant Sales Experience
14 June, ard 2:45 PM

I visited your outlet on 14 June around 2:45 PM with my father, who was planning to purchase a pair of shoes. During the checkout process, I casually mentioned that the same item appeared to be cheaper on Shopee due to ongoing promotions.

The sales staff who attended to us a young Chinese female responded rudely and unprofessionally. She immediately remarked, ‚ÄúShopee items are usually outlet stocks,‚Äù then took the shoes, threw them back onto the counter, and walked away abruptly leaving us standing at the cashier with no further assistance or explanation.

This kind of behavior is unacceptable, especially coming from a frontline staff member. As a large and reputable company, I believe you should place strong emphasis on staff training, particularly in customer service and professional conduct. Customers should never be made to feel disrespected or dismissed.

This is a sincere piece of feedback, not just for management to take note of, but also as a side note for the staff involved
""if managing your attitude or temper is a challenge, perhaps frontline customer service isn‚Äôt the right fit. Courtesy and respect are the minimum standards in any retail interaction"".
Otherwise stay home be princess!!

I hope this feedback is taken seriously and helps prevent similar situations for future customers.",2025-06-14T14:41:02.675Z,retail

Mister Mobile (Hougang),5,"Excellent and top-notch service from the staff with perfect service delivery and humble attitude. I had earlier cancelled my screen repair arrangement with MisterMobile due to time constraints as I went ahead for another shop to get my phone screen repaired quickly. However, the lcd screen from tht shop did not last even a week and cracked quickly. I felt completely hopeless and by sheer luck thats when Mister Mobile contacted me and checked me if my phone is ok and told that my new lcd screen has arrived and if i needed any help despite my earlier request to cancel my order with them. I was humbled by how they went beyond the mile to check if my phone still needed a repair. I went ahead with them this time on 20.8.25 at 7pm and was not disappointed. I was attended by two frontline young chaps who were calm and pleasant. Both took utmost care with my phone during the procedures. One was wearing glasses and he did the pre-checks while patiently informing me each time he did anything on the phone. Repair was done on the spot with abt 2 hour waiting. Post-check was done by the second young chap with a stylish hair and nice voice. He made sure my phone and its internal components were all fine. Even cleaned the phone well. Now my phone is working fine and the quality of the lcd is supreme. Thanks MisterMobile!! Definitely a very reliable outlet at Hougang. Kudos!!",2025-08-27T18:06:32.837Z,retail

Mister Mobile (Hougang),3,"update: their customer service contacted me to do service recovery by offering to do the data transfer for free, but informed them i have already done it on my own. he then offered to send the on site team to come to where i was to assess my trade in phone instead of me going to the shop. So they did and handled my trade in at my office which was much appreciated. Feedback to them that training of the ground staff is important rather than to do service recovery for every case. I am happy with their proactiveness for service recovery though i know for sure i will be hesitant to step into their shops again.

very disappointing services. i whatsapp them to ask about purchase of a honor phone and trade in of my existing samsung, i asked to pay for delivery, but was told that if i want to trade in, i should go to their shop so they can help me with the data transfer.

i texted them to say i was heading to the bishan shop but they did not reply till i was already there, and was told by the sales they do not have stock for my model. i asked which shop have stock and was told hougang. so the next day, i texted and say i will be going to the hougang shop and they sent me a QR code but i still had to join the queue. I queued for about 30 mins, and was served. When I asked about data transfer, he told me i had to pay $30 for the services and had to leave my phone there for a few hours. he also mentioned honor phone and samsung transfers are very limited and comes with many restrictions. he asked me to just pay for the phone, go home do transfer myself, and bring back the old phone to sell. of course, the price quoted may differ by then,

my question is, if that is the case, why can't i just pay for delivery in the first place instead of wasting 2 hours travelling for all the fuss? not once on whatsapp it was mentioned they charge for data transfer or leaving the phone for few hours. i change my phone every year and every single time, the sales had ""offered"" doing the transfer without even me asking. neither did i have to pay anything.

This will obviously be my last time using their services.",2025-08-21T07:57:13.435Z,retail

One of the best bike shops I‚Äôve ever been to.

When I brought my bike in for installation, everything proceeded without a hitch. The owners are truly amazing and friendly; he even included some more items for me.

They're undoubtedly one of the best triathlon stores out there as well as one of the few of its kind. I would definitely recommend people to get their bike fixed or other bike fitting there.

#NBD my first Tri Bike and new bike for 2024!!

Came to Tri Lab twice before for both my SL7 & Propel SL0. This time, my 3rd Bike Fit here comes with a new Bike!!!

Tri Lab had helped to make both my SL7 & SL0 more comfortable to ride on and of cos it would be the best place to go for my first Tri Bike.  CUBE Aerium TT!

Advise and recommendations from an Ironman + super-friendly staffs who are not pushy salesmen creates a welcoming environment where you can freely discuss your needs and preferences without feeling pressured to make unnecessary purchases.

This level of skillset and customer-centric approach makes it easy for me to trust their recommendations and make informed decisions about my purchases.

Tri Lab Singapore - Retul BikeFit,5,"Want to share my experience with Retul Fit.

Did a static fit previously from elsewhere but after few months I start to realise that I am not fully utilising (glutes, hamstring etc) and mostly only using quads. As a result, I always feel that my quads fatigue all the time during and after rides and keep getting dropped on climbs.

After I went for my first Retul Fit by Mr Ironman Jack, found out that my saddle was way too low, saddle wrong size and stem too low (wanna act pro I go and slam) hence affecting my pedaling efficiency, comfort and overall ride quality.

The fit was done according to Retul recommended stats and or course with Jack‚Äôs experience and adjustments, I went for 2 50+ KM rides with moderate and high intensity. Immediately noticed that I‚Äôm way comfortable, average power has increased with little to no leg fatigue even after a hard ride I went home with no cramps or pains and I no longer feel the burning sensation on my quads during inclines or climb.

I highly recommend. Worth every penny.",2023-07-13T15:11:04.678Z,retail

Line Stationery Gifts & Toys,2,"Line stationery has always been my go-to store. A place where I'd travel to happily to get my pens, refills and other miscellaneous items. Most of the time, I would go there for their printing services.

I am usually graced by the very friendly uncle who would not only do a good job at helping me print my stuffs but also gave me cheaper rate (because he knows I'm a student). Today, I experienced one of the most unsettling encounter with a lady who works there.

When I told her that I wanted to print some stuffs, she handed me the blue laptop for me to do it on my own - saying ""you can do on your own right?"" - which surprised me because that's not how the uncle does it. When the laptop was booting up, she ignored me and started chatting away with what seems to be a colleague/ a friend. Not that I mind, but the account was locked out and she didn't even bother to tell me that the password can be found on the paper that was sticked onto the laptop. ""It's there what?"" + pointing at the paper without any apology was what I had as a response when I told her that the account was locked.  But what irked me alot was the look she gave - the look that I should have known it was there and those eyes which seemingly said please do not bother me any further.

I am also disappointed that she couldn't help me further with the printing because I was unsure with the printing layout - which she could only solve by calling her boss. And right after that, she wanted to charge me for 18 pieces instead of 9 because she didn't bother to count until I told her to.

Arden Teal,5,"I recently picked up the Arden Teal Calafate Straight Cap Walnut Oxford and I have to say, it‚Äôs easily one of the best dress shoes I‚Äôve owned. What really stood out to me was how much attention to detail the team had put into the shoe. From the hand-painted, hand-burnished Argentinean calfskin leather to the subtle nuances in the finish, you can tell every pair is crafted with care and pride.

Mabir was also incredibly knowledgeable and took the time to walk me through the features and care tips, which made the whole experience feel very personal.

But the best part? The comfort. I wore them straight out of the box for a pre-wedding photoshoot and was genuinely surprised at how comfortable they were. No break-in period needed at all! The leather padded insole and quality lining make a huge difference, and I didn‚Äôt get any of the usual pinching or soreness you sometimes get with new Oxfords.

Star Living @ Serangoon North,5,"I am completely blown away by CK's service. He went above and beyond to serve me and my mum even though he was the only sales person working that day. I could see that he also gave full attention to another customer before us. I had a bad experience at HipVan earlier on as I was ignored by the only staff there so it was a delightful change at STAR living. When my mum and I first walked into the store, we immediately liked what we saw. The dining tables were modern and stylish, and the pricing was surprisingly affordable. CK was extraordinary because he gave us a lot of inputs and suggestions when we felt unsure which chair to pick that would go with the dining table. CK took time to explain about each design's different quality and material. It was obvious that he had a lot of experience. I ended up getting a sofa bed, a dining table and chairs, and two office chairs. Another benefit of coming to Star Living is that it shares its premises with King Koil, so it's a one-stop shop for those who want to buy beds and mattresses as well. Candy, the sales lady at King Koil, was also very delightful and sweet. It's too bad that I already bought a King Koil bed elsewhere 2 days ago. STAR Living has won me over! I told my brother who's getting a new flat soon that he should come to Star Living @ Serangoon North. I will recommend Star Living to all my friends and associates as well.

Smartbed Signature @ Serangoon,1,"Update:
Delivery schedule for 11-Dec-2024, had issue with the delivery with no response from the team. Demanded us to pay prior to delivery, but when we check for order delivery before hand, the sales person is often no where to be found. Informed to contact their customer service and we call the number found online and on the receipt. However it was not in use and in turn blame us that we have dial the wrong number when it is printed on the company invoice without any amendment from the management.  Next, the bed frame is delivered wrongly. Still got the cheeky to argue saying that is we make the changes when clearly the printed invoice by the sales person is showing our choice written clearly. After 3 weeks of wait, on 1 Jan-24 we are being inform that the color we have chosen is no longer available and not sure need to wait for how long. So what is the team doing since 3 weeks back?

This is so frustrating and the ops manager still have to cheek to tell us to meet in person and is easier to resolve matter, however Mr Floyd Warren still have the cheek to demand us to make payment prior to delivery when the company is clearly at fault!!!

Malvin is very knowledgeable and experience in the product. He is exceptionally friendly and willing to help us in selecting all our new home needs.
Would highly recommend him to whoever needed furniture recommendation. Kudos!!!",2025-01-01T13:59:40.374Z,retail
Smartbed Signature @ Serangoon,1,"I had a terrible experience purchasing a bed frame from SmartBed's Signature @ Serangoon outlet, and I want to warn others about the poor service I received from their salesperson, Malvin.

I ordered a king-size sit in bed frame, which was clearly discussed multiple times with Malvin at the store. My mattress at home is a king size, so there was no reason to order anything smaller. However, when he wrote up the sales order, he inexplicably noted it as a 5ft frame‚Äîwhich, unbeknownst to me at the time, is a queen size. As customers, how are we supposed to know these technical details like ""5ft"" equals queen? Malvin even reviewed the sales order with us and referred to it as a king-size bed frame, so we trusted him.

On the delivery day, a queen-size bed frame was delivered instead of the king size we agreed on. When I confronted Malvin about this error, he refused to take responsibility for his mistake. Instead of offering a proper resolution or compensation, he suggested that I buy a queen-size mattress at their ""cost price"" to solve the issue. How am I supposed to know what their actual cost price is? This was their mistake, and yet I‚Äôm expected to spend more money to fix it?

The bed frame is a sit-in bed, meaning the mattress sits inside the frame itself. This makes the problem even worse because my king-size mattress now doesn‚Äôt fit properly in the queen-size bed frame.

The worst part is that I had asked my interior designer to build side tables based on the measurements Malvin provided for the queen-size bed frame. Now, my bed frame doesn‚Äôt fit with my king-size mattress, and my renovation is already completed with no way to adjust. His carelessness has completely disrupted my plans and left me with a mess that I have to figure out how to fix.

This situation has been incredibly frustrating, and I wouldn‚Äôt want anyone else to go through what I did. If you‚Äôre buying a bed frame or mattress from SmartBed, please make sure the salesperson writes down ""king"" or ""queen"" explicitly on the sales order. Don‚Äôt rely on verbal agreements or trust them to get it right.

Lesson learned for me, but I will never shop at SmartBed again.",2024-12-23T02:23:32.962Z,retail

Smartbed Signature @ Serangoon,1,"Bad bad bad bad bad!!! Please avoid buying from this shop! Terrible after sales.

Bought a sofa during their midnight promo sales. Everything was pretty smooth and good during the sales. However it was the post sales follow up and service that was appalling!!!

Expect 180 degrees change in attitude the moment your money is deducted and in their pocket!

The day the Sofa arrived to our place, we noticed silver pen markings (not small, big ones) all over the sofa, when we enquired and feedback, was told the markings were a normal part of the process??? This was bought as a brand new sofa, mind you, so it doesn‚Äôt make any sense for there to be such markings.

Their solution offered, send someone down to use some ‚ÄúChinese oil‚Äù to try to wipe away the markings. Ridiculous remedy. Not only did it not work, now it made our sofa oily!!!

The markings are obvious and ridiculous and up till this day, the markings are all still glaring at me whenever I look at our sofa. Yet, their after sales best solution is that this can‚Äôt be helped and the markings are there to stay‚Ä¶

Never have I bought a sofa and have gotten such poor after sales and excuses.

If you want a brand new sofa without weird markings and writings, as if someone wrote stuff on it and all corners, then please stay away from SmartBed!!!

Be smart, learn from my mistake, stay away from them and their marketing gimmicks and you would have outsmarted them‚Ä¶ üëåüèºüëçüèª",2024-06-20T00:53:09.384Z,retail

T For Toys - Toy Store,5,"We visited T for Toys based on the impressive Google reviews and weren't disappointed. More than a mere toy warehouse, it emerges as a meticulously organised and clean haven for children and parents alike. My visit on 30th Sept, revealed rows of neatly stacked, individually packed toys, all maintained in a temperature-controlled environment, ensuring quality preservation.

The staff, particularly Auntie Monica (hope I got her name right), deserve a special mention for not only being knowledgeable about the products but also for engaging and entertaining my kids with intriguing toys, allowing me to consult what to buy comfortably with my wife over the phone. The toys, while not your typical branded products, are of commendable quality, offering a wide array of options from wooden fruits to high-quality plastic homeware, costumes to educational STEM sets, and more. We departed with a handful including kitchen sets, wash basins, medical sets, tea sets and more, much to the kids delight. The only gripe is the purchase process, where you'll still need to visit their website to select, check out and pay. While it does take some time, we weren't in a rush and the staff were helpful throughout.

T for Toys is a unique and delightful shopping experience, with well-categorised toys and easy aisles. House brands dominate the store, giving the it a similar experience to a Decathlon but for toys. Definitely recommendable for quality, variety, and exceptional service! It won't be long before we make a return visit.",2023-10-05T12:01:03.334Z,retail

Brought a colleague here. She was happy to be able to purchase stuff for her niece and nephew (8yo). I bought another gift for my friend's 9yo daughter.
The family games are quite interesting too. But I think can stock more games for older people.

7 July 2023
My first time here. Was looking for a gift for a friend's 9yo daughter and found this on Google. The reviews were pretty solid so I decided to give it a try. Texted at the WhatsApp number given and whoever it was who answered was really helpful.
Dropped by the store to have a look see. Monica was really helpful. They have a pretty good range of stuff, quite reasonably priced too. However, do note that it is an online purchase store, and this place is just their warehouse, so you'd still have to order and make payment online.
Spent $59 for 5 games. Quite reasonable.
Would've liked to have more toys for older kids though. Most of what I saw were 3+, 5+, 8+. How about 12+, 15+, 18+ too?",2023-08-02T04:58:55.341Z,retail

Novena (Tampines),1,"Worse place to get furnitures. Somewhere during April, i purchased a queen size bed and wardrobe and was attended by this sales person Julie. After purchasing, she informed that there was no stock for the bed in the warehouse at that moment and I would had to wait till early June. Didn‚Äôt have the decency to inform before i paid for it so i had no choice but to agree. During early june, there was no news about it. I had to constantly keep calling her instead of her calling me to update. All i got was ‚Äúthe stock haven‚Äôt arrived yet. I call my manager then update u again.‚Äù Still, no update from her. After that, i had called her multiple times and asked for a refund and i was told ‚Äúsorry we cannot refund u‚Äù. Hence i called the main office n i was told the same thing ‚Äúno stock now. We don‚Äôt know when will arrive‚Äù‚Ä¶ what is this??? After 2 weeks, still no update from anyone. Hence, i emailed in to the customer care service and there was no reply as well. After multiple emails n saying that I would bring this matter up to CASE, finally they replied and finally Julie called. Telling me that she ‚ÄúHELPED‚Äù me to negotiate with her manager to exchange the bed frame to a more expensive one. When the goods finally arrived, there were some defects on my wardrobe door. Again, i was told to wait for the replacement door. And now, they said the replacement part has arrived and they have to bring back that defect door to replace the aluminium part instead of replacing the whole door for me (which was told to me initially). Never again will I buy stuffs from Novena Tampines anymore and I would not recommend any of my family and friends to go there. Worse after sales service I have ever encountered.",2025-08-22T02:04:59.553Z,retail

Urban Mood,4,"The on-site delivery team: 5 stars - arrived and finished on-time within the 5-hour delivery window, were super professional and friendly. They did the assembly job quickly and even helped to wipe it down somewhat due to wood shavings created from drilling assembly.

The Lien bed itself is attractive, and at a decent price point. Finished product (wood slabs) was good, not amazing, but decent for the price. Storage hydraulic is a little jerky, but overall the bed offers significant storage, though it may not be practically accessible given how heavy a king mattress will be on top - so the 2 small drawers design is useful.

But the online website and sales process needs improvement. The website is misleading, it shows choice of colors and size that may already be discontinued or out of stock. Expect some conversation with customer service.

There is shipment tracking but product came from China via sea freight so between the factory production time, any inclement weather and customs clearance, be prepared to wait a bit for your purchase.

I went shopping with my son for a pair of pants, and the staff were very helpful, friendly, and quick to assist. My son felt a little shy at first, as he did not realise it was a women‚Äôs clothing store, but the team made the visit so comfortable that he did not feel out of place at all.

POPULAR Bookstore,1,"I recently visited the Popular Bookstore and was left incredibly frustrated. Firstly, the queue at the counter was excessively long with only one cashier serving customers. This resulted in a significant wait time, which was incredibly inconvenient. I ended up waiting a full 15 minutes for a purchase that amounted to only $6.

Secondly, the store itself was poorly organized. Items were strewn about, creating a chaotic and cluttered atmosphere. The labeling of sections was also confusing, making it difficult to find specific books or products.
I hope the store management addresses these issues to improve the customer experience.

Overall, my experience at Popular Bookstore was disappointing. The long wait times and poor organization significantly detracted from what should have been a pleasant purchase experience.",2025-01-02T09:04:11.232Z,retail

Sengkang Books & Stationeries,1,"HONESTLY : ZERO STARS

horrible horrible staff. Wanted to bind 7 books and arrived at 6pm. They close at 9pm and told me they can't bind it, not enough time because they are closing up soon. Tomorrow then come back. Hello? You close at 9pm but can still say wont have enough time to bind? In the midst of this all, the staff dare to get angry and throw my papers around. Messed up my papers until all of the papers have to be reorganised again to be binded. Extra work for me. Horrible service!!! Wont ever recommend. It's obvious they are too lazy to get any work done. All they do is chit chat and barely tend to any customers. I know it wont take that long to bind as I went there last week and they made a huge fuss about it aswell. Said it will take 1 hour+ to bind 3 books. We got angry and told them we wont go anywhere and we waited there till they finished. Only then did they do it and finish all 3 books in 10mins. So its not a matter of long or not. They just don't want to because they are too lazy. Even when my 5 year old was holding onto a toy, one of the staff had the audacity to ask her to put it down if we weren't planning on buying it. With that kind of attitude, trust me, had I wanted to purchase her that toy, I WOULD HAVE NEVER SPENT A DOLLAR MORE DUE TO THEIR SERVICE. Now after this second chance, even more so I WILL NOT SPEND ANY MORE MONEY THERE ANYMORE. Will go down to the other printing store at Cheng San Centre instead.",2025-08-20T10:44:33.652Z,retail

The staff told me they do not have thicker paper unless I buy 1 packet of the paper from their shop which costs $5 and they will use that to print for me. I was fine with it so was willing to pay the $5. However, when the staff printed the certificate for me, there was white borders and grid lines water mark on the paper. I questioned why is there watermark and the staff actually told me she was not sure as she printed directly from my file. As for the borders, she cannot do anything to resize. I was quite upset about this as my document was not properly printed so I told her never mind, I don‚Äôt want to proceed printing anymore of my files. The staff then told me regardless I will still need to pay $5+$1 (for printing) as she already printed. Attitude and service was bad, not to mentioned I did not get to print my files in the end which is a waste of my time and money.",2025-07-18T06:08:13.261Z,retail

Started when the lady asked me if I have already sent the docs for printing since it doesn‚Äôt appear on their gmail. (She commented: I cannot print if you didn‚Äôt send the email you know?)

When the docs were already with her for viewing, gave her instructions which pages to omit (She remarked: wah, you cannot check your phone for which pages to print)?

While waiting, I asked if the docs were really printing because I cannot hear the copier, she then made me come near to the copier and told me ‚ÄúSee that, you‚Äôre asking me print 200 plus pages of course your docs haven‚Äôt come out mah)

Proceeds to go their cashier and call me stupid.

I paid $135 for the docs, mind you and this is the customer service you‚Äôre treating me?!?!

Sengkang Books & Stationeries,5,To counter one of the poor review earlier. Price for the print are clearly stated on the printer. It's a old school shop in a old plaza and the cashiers are all simple and nice people. 50 cent is for digital print which they have to retrieve from email. Photocopy is 20 cent.

Its the only photocopy shop in the neighbourhood, so theres a monopoly here.",2024-07-08T03:33:39.427Z,retail
Sengkang Books & Stationeries,1,"I would give a negative rating if I could. I recently visited the shop and was extremely disappointed with their pricing and overall service. They charge an outrageous $0.50 per piece of paper (Black & White), even if you print on both sides! This is completely unreasonable, especially considering that double-sided printing should cost less since it saves paper.

Moreover, the staff did not provide a total price before printing and then demanded payment upfront, leaving you with no option but to accept the printed documents. I walked away as it was too expensive and did not accept the offer because they did not seek my consent with the pricing before printing. Under contract law, I am not legally bound to pay for papers they printed without my agreement.

Additionally, the shop appeared to be run by a group of young Malaysians who seemed to be secondary school students, based on their accents and appearance. I would highly suggest the authorities to look into their employment. Avoid this place if you‚Äôre looking for fair pricing and transparent service.",2024-05-28T06:34:08.822Z,retail

POPULAR Bookstore,1,"I approached an Indian lady staff member and told her I wanted to exchange two Harry Potter books for other items, as I had bought the wrong ones. I specifically mentioned that the books were from the NEX outlet, and she nodded, confirming it was okay.

At around 3:04 PM, I selected multiple products worth $29.91 and returned to the same staff member to process the exchange. I clearly stated, ‚ÄúI want to exchange the Harry Potter books for these items.‚Äù She acknowledged this and called an older woman for assistance.

The older woman informed me that opened books (one of mine had its plastic packaging removed) could not be exchanged in the future. She then repeatedly asked if these were the books I wanted to exchange, and I confirmed. She instructed me to get another first Harry Potter book, which I assumed was for scanning purposes, so I retrieved a sealed copy.

After scanning both books, she calculated the total as $29.91. Everything seemed fine until she asked the Indian staff member to complete the transaction. However, instead of processing the exchange, the Indian lady scanned all my items and charged me for them. I paid without realizing the mistake and then asked, ‚ÄúWait, if this is an exchange, shouldn‚Äôt I not be paying?‚Äù

She called back the older woman, who became visibly irritated and snapped, ‚ÄúI asked you multiple times if these were the books you wanted to exchange. You said you bought the wrong book and wanted to exchange it for the one you brought me.‚Äù

At this point, my friend stepped in and clarified, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs here to exchange the books she bought from NEX for other products here.‚Äù The older woman suddenly realized her mistake‚Äîdespite me having mentioned earlier that the books were from NEX. She had not understood this and had assumed I only wanted to swap the books for different editions. Frustrated, she grabbed the Harry Potter book and threw it into a basket before processing my refund.

Her tone then became calmer, but the items I had chosen did not add up exactly to $29.91, so my friend and I had to pick out additional candy to match the amount. Despite adding two sweets, the total was still short, and the older woman, now visibly annoyed, signaled her frustration to the Indian lady.

Eventually, we selected four sweets, bringing the total to $30.21, requiring me to pay an extra $0.30. Even after completing the transaction, the older woman continued displaying attitude and signaling her irritation.

She was soooo soooo sweet and went the extra mile to arrange delivery for me - out of good will. I mean, who would have gone such an extra effort to do these for customers. We chatted and laughed at topics on how customers can be hard to serve these days cos I‚Äôm also in the sales line. I am sure it is not an easy job for Yana especially when customers can be quite demanding at times but she went an extra mile beyond her area of responsibilities .

APOL Singapore,5,"This is my second purchase from APOL and the whole experience has been fantastic. After buying the Behemoth chair for my home, I decided to buy the same for the office but in black this time. As I was browsing, I came across the Levodesk and there was a bundle for the chair and the adjustable height table. I did  a lot of research as I was afraid that the table would not be at the height I wanted. I needed one at the office as I just went for spinal surgery and I was told I should not be sitting down too long daily and to get a standing deck.
Well, the day came and after a quick installation, the table and chair are now my best friends at work. I can quickly transition from sitting and standing with my presets and did I mention it is virtually noiseless?
So i now have 3 APOL products and I am a fan for life. Excuse me while I go lounge in my chair.
OH, and a shout-out to the very friendly uncle and auntie that assisted in the assembly. I felt really bad that I could not assist in carrying and shifting the table as I was recovering from surgery.",2024-06-08T07:49:25.768Z,retail

I get it, working retail can be tough, but a little friendliness goes a long way, especially when you're dealing with kids and their parents. I've asked for recommendations, help finding specific books which could be found at other outlets but not here, and the responses have been short, dismissive, or just plain unhelpful.

It's a shame because the bookshop itself is lovely & could use some sales from time to time (i hope). If they could just improve the customer service, this place would be a gem. As it is, I'm hesitant to go back, which is a shame.",2025-05-18T06:55:58.581Z,retail

Very poor service encountered with a prestigious international acclaimed brand! Big discounts can be found here , that explains why there is also a discount in their service attitude! I don‚Äôt mean to be nasty and post this but I am stating the facts here. Below is a feedback I gave to them :

Dear Team,

I‚Äôm here to offer a service feedback. My friends had went over to your outlet at IMM today afternoon  20/4/2025

Upon making payment, The service attitude of your 2 staff is totally unacceptable. Your staff did not ask if my friends are member or not. And the tone of voice of your staff used was unacceptable as it is very loud.

Is it that my friends are from China and your staff thinks that they don‚Äôt understand English and overlooked on the asking of the procession of your esteemed membership?

Or is the service standard at IMM outlet store  is of such as your selling price there is lower than other outlets?

This service attitude is truly unacceptable for such a prestigious international acclaimed brand of yours ! And this incident had already caused the mood of my friends for the day.

I would appreciate if you could have a reply to me of the course of actions you are going to undertake on this unpleasant shopping experience at your IMM outlet.",2025-04-20T12:02:00.918Z,retail

However the following day(4th June, 2024) on the flip side it takes an hour or so before the retail shop answers my repeated calls. Awaiting Nurul the manager to come back to me on the ""oversight"" of the cashier. 3.5 star on reception/cashier.

Nurul, you mentioned you need a few days to revert  but it has been 16 days Ihave yet to reveceived your email. This is very dissapointing from your assurance you will write back to me.
____________________________________
After my above updated comment(20th June), I called up and spoke to Nurul and  was told she is still waiting for the Com. Side to revert. That means as a consumer being told to give them a few days  but no email and I have to assume they will eventually get back to me, whenever that will be. So no need from their side to update me the status, but just wait and wait and wait till I forget?
Puma, JD and other sports retail outlets are so on top of their game. This is a small issue that can be resolved in a matter of minutes.
Managememt of Adidas, I told Nurul, I give you two more days  to revert. Apologise due to your manner in handling such matters your rating just gone down. Please have a look how the adidas team manages at Changi City point or Orchard.",2024-06-20T11:22:26.006Z,retail

I am writing to express my disappointment with the service I received from one of your cashiers on 12.2.2025, at approximately 8:30 pm. (Yesterday)

During my visit, I felt that the cashier's attitude was unfriendly. She appeared unhappy and displayed a negative demeanor while assisting me. Specifically, when packing the shoes and socks I purchased, her facial expression seemed particularly displeased.

I hope you will investigate this matter and take necessary steps to improve the cashier's service. I look forward to receiving better service during my future visits to your store.

Thank you for your attention to this matter

POPULAR Bookstore (HQ),1,"Not recommended based on numerous occasions as experienced and observed in store, over phone via enquiries and through their customer service at headquarters as claimed ( they have a customer service department ).

Taking into consideration there was no feedback emailed as official complaint that permits them to take customers for granted, chances were given in vain.

They will never apologise especially after defective goods are sold. Before that they are eager to sell. After which is irresponsibility. In fact, they taunted customer till this feedback has to be generated as review.

Again, episode is repeated ( a customer service staff named A since left )

No surprise they pretended to want to serve over the line then proceeded to twist the words to their benefit; bombarded the customer over a call to mock consumer repeatedly. 5 times in total. Customer is their joke.

Taken for granted, insulted and to humiliate.

This is conduct of that customer service staff name D. Just business to them. Sums in retail. Imagine the rest of consumers going through that particular customer service, a paid job at that.  Read the rest of their reviews as proofs, please.

That‚Äôs quite a number of black sheeps and negative experiences are reported on social media. Facts are facts. Rude staff, toxic work cultures and negative customer service in their company.

They ignored, lied about their words and used it against customer, assuming no one will hear about it. Rather despicable and absurd for their condescending behaviour. Using the customer so hypocritically like a sale of merchandise?

"Toys""R""Us - Waterway Point",1,"I would give zero stars to this Toys""R""Us. The staff, especially the on shift manager's performance needs to be reviewed by the senior management. If Toysrus as a global brand does not offer gift wrapping or has no stock of wrapping paper, then there should be a big sign and the cashiers should inform this to the customers before the item is bought. Not once the payment is made and then tell them. This seems like a ploy to take the money and then not offer a refund when the customer has been fooled about a typical service which should be offered (has been as well) by one of the biggest gift retailers globally. Even when I went out to buy a wrapper from kiddy palace and returned to request them to wrap it, they refused the service. So shame on you, it's a lie then that you're out of stock of wrapping paper, the truth is, you just simply don't want to wrap gifts.

I went to their Tampines studio for the QYOP weekend not knowing what to expect but it was a very enjoyable time at her studio. No hardselling, no pressure, totally overstayed beyond the slot I booked because of my own indecisiveness but it was such a friendly atmosphere that I felt like I was hanging out at a friend‚Äôs house. Instead of buying the items available under QYOP, I decided to custom order an armchair and a mirror. Honestly I did plenty of research and shopping before this so I knew the armchair was a GREAT price even for customisation. It was around the same price for  something I shortlisted on TB but here I could do a quality check and got the wonderful design advice from Desiree! She also sent photo updates from the factory and when I was concerned about whether the right colour was made, she double checked to assure me. When my items arrived, it totally elevated my apartment. Desiree has a great eye for design, and amazing customer service!! She was so patient to work around my messy schedule and got her delivery man to send it even late at night when I was finally home. What a boss babe! Can‚Äôt wait to custom more things from Desiree next time.",2025-05-11T09:19:30.222Z,retail
The Happy Place Studio,5,"I got to know The Happy Place 4 years ago.  I customised a round 900mm dining table with a sintered top.  As I had a set of dining chairs I liked to use along with the dining table, Desiree spared no effort to help me find the closest walnut shade to the dining chairs.  Fast forward 4 years later, the dining table is still in a good condition and I continue to use it at a coffee corner in my new home.

I returned to The Happy Place again 2 months ago, after failing to find affordable pieces of furniture that fits the theme of my new home without breaking the bank.  Desiree helped me customised the furniture (dining set with storage bench, ottoman, lounger chair and a travertine bedside table) in accordance to my theme of my new home.  Seeing how the furniture from The Happy Place blends in my new home brought joy to my family.

Throughout the waiting process, I received constant updates on the manufacturing of the furniture and Desiree helped me timed the delivery together ahead of my housewarming party.  The furniture arrived in good condition, delivery and installation team were helpful and friendly.

My only regret was not purchasing room dividers from The Happy Place!  I will certainly recommend The Happy Place and if I need furniture in future, I would not hesitate reaching out to them first.

Plus he also answered additional questions that I had regarding phone repairs.,2025-08-20T13:16:57.304Z,retail
Mister Mobile (City Plaza),1,"1. Waiting time too long. If you are going to have a reservation service, then be truthful to it. Even if you reserve a time slot, you have to wait in a queue. The queue is confusing, and people come in and cut the queue because they are unsure about where to queue.
2. Incompetent staff. I have to be the one correcting them. They don't have information immediately and have to check their ipad repeatedly. While speaking, other staff interrupt our conversations regarding doubts, don't they all have the same experience? Can't they resolve problems by themselves?
3. Trade in prices are poor and old. Wanted to trade in a basically new phone for a used but pristine phone. Bought phone for 1300. Will get up to 750 if trading in opened and activated within 14 days. Okay sure I thought to myself even though it was almost half the original price because of a phone I wanted which was 850 pristine used. Upon giving it. They say it's used and come down to 650. What nonsense. That other phone I want is also used and it's only going for 1000 brand new online same with my phone which also goes for 1000+ online. 650 for a flagship phone that was opened and activated under 14 days and is purely clean with no marks scuffs etc and 848 for a phone that is 4 months old, with mild wear and tear and has only a few months of warranty left is poor pricing given the price you can get these phones for brand new. Update your trade in prices and used phone prices keeping in mind the cost of the phones brand new. Was looking forward to getting that phone so much so that I was willing to accept the 848 asking price. But trade in of 650 for a practically new phone is upsetting.
4. Asked sales rep to get manager to discuss this. Sales rep says just keep your phone. Did I ask? And If I wanted to why would I come to this store. Once rep went to get manager, manager is apparently so busy that he used this sales rep as a messenger to go back and forth.  Manager must be busier than Tim Cook.
5. I was appalled by this lack of support and service and that I couldn't get the device I wanted.
6. I gave one star just for your repair services. You only charge for the repair if you can properly diagnose and fix the issue. I didn't test this but other positive reviews support it.
7. Negotiation is non existent. They follow fixed prices made up by some other department that clearly doesn't know the value of devices. They have no empathy either, I came a long way to this outlet just for that phone. If I am buying a used device or selling a device, I have to give my opinions and reasoning. If it makes sense then you have to do something to please the customer.
In an overview, You lost a potential lifelong customer. Only come here if you want to either be disappointed or repair your phone. Thanks for taking time to read my review. Phone to trade in - Find X8, Phone I wanted to get - Honor Magic 7 Pro.",2025-08-20T09:45:51.566Z,retail

Mister Mobile (Woodlands),5,"Hello...I went to your Woodlands Branch twice, that is 27/7 and 9/8. Both were for purchase of new mobile. The first visit we were lucky that the model that my son was interested in was available. Mr Marcus Ang served us. He has good customer service. He is very polite and patience. I wanted to pay by vouchers and cash so Mr Marcus explained how the system works. The first transaction went smoothly and my son is happy with his new mobile. My second visit was after I made several enquiries through your whatsapp number. I enquired about the availability of particular model and color available . Your whatsapp Admin told me it was only available at your Tampines outlet. I did not gave up and asked 'Can transfer it to your Woodlands branch? I live at Woodlands'. I did not wait long and I received whatapp confirming my reservations. It was on National Day a PH but they were willing to go to the extend for their customer. Good Jobüëç. Late afternoon went to Woodlands branch to make my purchase and was served by Mr Marcus Ang again. Purchased transaction settled fast as they had my record. Mister Mobile...please recognise good efforts put forward by your staff like Mr Marcus Ang. His personal touch will make a lot of difference to your organisation. My appreciations also to the person behind the whatsapp chats on 9/8/25. Thank you for your kind assistance. üòäüòäüëåüëåüëå",2025-08-17T04:48:58.517Z,retail

If you do not understand me, I could repeat myself. There is no need to show me attitude. If you dislike your job, I promise you that you do not have to stay. ps. he was wearing black spectacles iirc.

Mister Mobile (Bukit Panjang),2,"I got my S22 ultra screen replaced with Mister Mobile at Bukit Panjang earlier in January this year as I dropped it. Repair went well and paid $278 and I was told to avoid water contact as it is no longer IP68 rated which is fair advice given.
About 7 months later, the screen started glitching, colors were washed out and phone cannot be set to 120hz refresh rate or it would glitch crazily which I needed to use screen mirroring to reset to 60hz. Brought it down to the same branch to understand why a Grade A screen would fail after less than a year. Tried to show the staff the issue I'm facing and one glance he says it'll cost $268 to fix without examining the phone.
I said I got this replaced here and wanted to know why is it glitching so badly. The response was all Samsung phones are known to have this issue and screens are known to fail after awhile. I wish they had given a disclaimer when they replaced my screen in January to anticipate a failure down the road in a year's time, maybe I would have just put that money into a new phone. Before I dropped my phone, original screen was fine and had no green lines or glitches.
By then I've heard enough, thanked him and walked away dissapointed. I guess I'm posting here just as a heads up to people looking to replace their Samsung LCD screens not to expect too much longevity, I've got seven months out of it, maybe you could do better than me.",2025-08-23T14:31:32.685Z,retail

"Love, Bonito ION Orchard - Women's Fashion & Clothing",5,"Horrible ! I‚Äôm a foreign customer and purchased 11 pieces of outfits from Ion branch and only to find one of the skirt they gave me was wrong after I returned to my country . There is no phone number that I can contact and I‚Äôm so disappointed that I didn‚Äôt get the skirt that I loved instead I was given a dress that look very similar except that it has 2 strings to tie on shoulder as a dress . Same color same design but it was not my skirt ! Why do they give you a new piece in plastic bag at the counter when paying but not open to show customer . I know we are supposed to check but the dress and skirt looked very similar in the plastic bag you wouldn‚Äôt have thought to open and check . Totally disappointed!!

This is an update of the disappointment I had as I described above . With a suggestion from a friend I managed to contact love bonito on email . The customer service was really helpful and quick in their responses . After 30 emails back and froth, I managed to changed my skirt at another outlet at my convenience . I do appreciate their efforts and I bought another 2 psc from them . I will still continue to buy from them .",2025-08-21T11:49:42.897Z,retail

I would like to share my recent experience at your Joon Koon outlet. The service at the workshop was very slow, with only one staff member attending to many customers. This led to long queues and a lot of waiting time.

It seems that the store is understaffed, especially during weekends when there are many customers with issues such as bike or badminton racket servicing. The slow service caused quite a frustrating experience for me, and I believe for other customers as well.

I hope Decathlon can improve the staffing and service speed at the Joon Koon workshop to provide a smoother experience for customers.",2025-08-23T09:35:58.492Z,retail

Mister Mobile (Jurong),3,"I‚Äôve had a series of really frustrating experiences with this shop. On my first visit some months ago, I had an appointment to replace my phone‚Äôs LCD. They confirmed the appointment, but when I arrived, they told me there was no stock. This was never communicated in advance, so it was a wasted trip.

They did offer a small discount and eventually replaced the screen when I returned, but even then I had to wait in line despite having a scheduled time. They also didn‚Äôt have the same type of screen protector I had requested and gave me a lower quality one instead.

Most recently, I tried them again for my mother‚Äôs Samsung Note10 power button repair. They confirmed that a different branch had the part, but after waiting a couple of hours there, they told me their part wouldn't actually work and I‚Äôd have to come back again.

In short, each visit has been marked by poor communication and a lot of wasted time. Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt recommend this shop based on these experiences and I hope they improve their service in the future.

============

Staff reached out promptly after this review and assisted to settle the button issue within the next few days.
Hope that they continue to work on their services.",2025-08-22T08:22:55.095Z,retail

BUT didn‚Äôt do any checks whatsoever to claim lens is ‚Äúfaulty‚Äù. Asked him to check and he reluctantly claimed the .5x lens is the issue AFTER I asked him to but camera and zoom both working fine. Claims now working but in the future may not.

Aces Mobile,2,"I just got my Z Flip 5 flex cable repaired. Service was pretty good, they were fast and responsive, and upfront about potential issues.

The repair quality is a bit suspect though - the phone exterior wasn't in great condition to begin with, but it's much worse now. üòÖ Lots of glue protruding from different parts, and some scrapes and chipping where it was pried apart. When I open it there's also a slight creasing sound and the closing doesn't look quite right. I still got charged full price for the repair.

But the cable has been fixed and it works! They provide only a 30-day warranty for this, compared to the 90-day for their other repairs, so I will see how long this lasts.

Edit: Dropped a star because their response is quite disingenuous. The screen was damaged prior, but the exterior was totally fine -- and from the photos you can see now that it's quite a mess. That was their doing.

A month on and the phone is holding up all right, but the hinge is a bit wobbly and probably will not last long. Overall I'd say that it's an expensive and low-quality fix.",2025-04-24T12:35:44.137Z,retail
