PEM Confinement Nanny Agency Pte Ltd,5,"We are so incredibly grateful to have had Anny (#1689) with us for the past 28 days. Her presence in our home brought an immediate sense of comfort, confidence, and peace of mind during such a vulnerable time.

She took amazing care of our newborn with a love and patience that was beautiful to watch. But her care didn't stop there; she was also dedicated to my wife's recovery, cooking nourishing confinement meals, and looking after the well-being of our entire family. She handled everything with such skill and grace, and we learned countless invaluable tips from her wealth of experience.

All the teachers are attentive and kind. Their lessons are engaging and they go out of the way to ensure the kids needs are met. Special mention to Ms Stiffany who looks out for all her kids and makes them feel safe and happy everyday. They are extremely patient and also identify areas where kids excel and also areas where the school can help work with parents to help kids improve. Not to mention the school gives ample time for out door play and they have pool time which the kids love. It makes them look forward to going to school.

My child likes it very much.",2025-04-27T15:39:11.721Z,education
Sheffield Kidsworld ( St Anne) Pte. Ltd,5,"We are so grateful to have found Sheffield Kidsworld (St Anne) for both our sons. The school has a strong focus on instilling values like responsibility, independence and beliefs about environmental sustainability from an early age, and the children are constantly engaged in activities that foster creativity, imaginative play, and speech expression. The Friday pool time is always a highlight for the children!

Class sizes are small, allowing each child to receive individualised attention. The school’s facilities are also excellent — with many varied spaces that ensure a rich and diverse learning experience. We also appreciate the frequent updates from the teachers regarding our children’s behaviour and progress, keeping us closely connected to their learning journey.

One instance that reflected the school’s dedication to safety was when a teacher immediately flagged my helper who was not careful when crossing the road with my child.

Our elder child, who was initially hyperactive, was nurtured with patience by caring teachers like Teacher Muna and Su Laoshi. Thanks to their support, he gradually learnt to settle down and thrive in a classroom environment. Numeracy and literacy were also very well covered; we never had to send our boys for additional enrichment classes like I Can Read or Berries. The Chinese spelling list was challenging though. Both my boys developed a strong foundation that prepared them well for primary school.

What truly sets Sheffield Kidsworld (St Anne) apart is Mr Puhal, the principal. He knows each and every child by heart and is always eager to share his teaching philosophy and suggestions with parents. It has been a privilege to have placed both our sons under his leadership and care. We highly recommend Sheffield Kidsworld (St Anne) to any parent seeking a nurturing, high-quality early education for their child.",2025-04-27T06:48:50.455Z,education
Sheffield Kidsworld ( St Anne) Pte. Ltd,5,"I will like to post my review on the marvellous educational system of Sheffield Kidsworld at St Anne, the principal and teachers in helping to nurture my child in this childcare centre. Currently, my son is in N1 at Sheffield Kidsworld St Anne.

Prior to enrolment to Sheffield Kidsworld, my son had a traumatic experience after 2 days of school in little footprints at 420 Sengkang. Son was not keen to attend any childcare school after the traumatic incident in his previous childcare centre. Had sleepless nights and not able to focus on any learning.

We had continued to source for preschool for my son. Chance upon on Sheffield Kidsworld, I call up the principal, Mr Puhal. He was patient and empathetic towards our son”s situation. He had a  close discussion with parents on how to help my son transit back to preschool effectively. Teachers at Sheffield Kidsworld were also informed of the traumatic experiences in the previous childcare centre and with their patience and dedication help my son transit and cope well in school now.

Through the last few months, I had observed my son effective transition into this childcare centre. He was initially still not keen or not able to cope with school. Through the compassion, care, patience and effective discussions from the principal and teachers from Sheffield Kidsworld at St Anne, my son is now able to transit effectively into school life. My son is happy and proud to attend school daily. I had also seen changes in my son learning. He is very keen in learning now. Had also participated in activities in school and is proud in going to school daily now.

I had also observe the school teachers on the childcare focus on the holistic development of my son since the day he started at Sheffield Kidsworld  St Anne.
I know that the school had provided a nurturing environment for effective learning as well

Lastly, I will like to take this opportunity to post this review as well to thank all the help especially to principal Mr Puhal, teachers- Muna, Sun Lao Shi, Stiffany for the dedication, patience and compassion in helping to nurture not only my son and all the children in Sheffield Kidsworld St Anne.
Thousand thanks 👍

Sheffield Kidsworld ( St Anne) Pte. Ltd,5,"My daughter has been with Sheffield Kidsworld @ St Anne’s since she was just 18 months old, all the way till her graduation. Before enrolling her, we searched high and low around Rivervale Estate for a preschool that could accept her as soon as she turned 18 months. We were fortunate to come across this hidden gem tucked away in a corner.

We were even luckier that the school accepted her early, even though it meant she had to stay in PG (Playgroup) a little longer than most. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise, especially because of Teacher Muna—who, despite not being a parent herself at the time, took amazing care of our little one and guided her with so much patience and love. Taking care of toddlers at that age is no easy feat!

Over the years, my girl blossomed. She became more bubbly, confident, and even got selected as one of the speakers at her graduation concert—a moment we’ll always treasure. The teachers, principal, and the management team are truly top-notch.

In fact, I trust this school so much that my other two younger kids are currently enrolled here too. I cannot recommend Sheffield Kidsworld enough!",2025-04-24T02:09:09.911Z,education

Gladys Care 1987,5,"I am extremely grateful for the support and guidance I received from Gladys. As a new mom, I struggled with breastfeeding and felt frustrated and worried that I wasn't producing enough milk for my baby. In desperation, I texted Gladys in the middle of the night, and she kindly visited me the next day.

Gladys is a compassionate and knowledgeable lactation consultant. My milk ducts were clogged and needed a boost to kick-start production, and Gladys' TCM massages effectively activated them. Thanks to Gladys, I was able to establish a successful breastfeeding experience.

After completing the TCM sessions, my milk flow improved significantly, making breastfeeding and pumping faster and more efficient. My supply also increased, allowing me to fulfill my baby's needs.

I highly recommend Gladys to any mom seeking lactation support. Her dedication, expertise, and kindness are exceptional, and I feel fortunate to have had her by my side throughout my breastfeeding journey. For those who are struggling , with the right support, any mom can overcome challenges and successfully breastfeed. Good luck mommas and Thank you Gladys! 😊",2024-05-01T08:50:48.328Z,education

Gladys Care 1987,5,"I recently delivered my child a few weeks earlier than the EDD due to certain complications which I was having. As such, I was worried about the confinement nanny situation due to these sudden last minute developments.

However, Gladys really went out of her way to ensure that both baby & myself were fully covered & well taken care of by a nanny after coming home from the hospital.

I would also like to specially mention nanny Ming Zhu as she has been cooking delicious meals for both my husband & myself.
Her attention to noticing our baby's details has been very assuring to us as well.

Gladys' post-natal massages have indeed  been very reliving & effective in reducing the post-pregnancy water retention/bloating. Would highly recommend choosing Gladys Care to all new mums/mums-to-be!",2024-04-05T16:08:31.295Z,education

Gladys Care 1987,1,"poor experience with the nannies from this agency. Although the agent was responsive and tried to salvage the situation, the quality of the nannies are really poor.

First nanny - obsessed with her phone (did not turn off notification sounds), did not burp baby sufficiently resulting in frequent vomiting, used phone while taking care of baby. Unhygienic practices of letting bb drink unfinished formula milk after 1-2 hours. Complained to us about her pay and helped herself to our food w/o asking.

(Add on a point on the vomiting, apart from over-feeding that resulted in frequent vomiting (projectile vomit, not spitting milk), it was established that the nanny didn’t burp the baby sufficiently which resulted in baby vomiting in her sleep. Now, this is dangerous. The vomiting part is still manageable. Vomiting in sleep is not acceptable!)

Replacement nanny - not trained in confinement (machiam like housewife). cannot wash anything clean (milk bottles were oily after she washed). cooked about less than 1l of red dates tea for me initially and had to tell her to cook more. prepare herbal bath one time and use for 2 days (the herbal water kept till smelly). Complained about us over the phone and kena caught because we could hear from baby monitor. Food was the same everyday, tasteless sometimes and very repetitive. She cooks the same few veggie, chicken and rarely fish. Husband asked her what fish to buy she told us to ask the fish monger. Dismissed her finally because she gave bb formula milk every hour during the night shift because she didn't know why baby was crying and kept feeding bb milk.

Both nannies do not know how to update logs - time, amount of feeding, time of poop etc.

These are just some of the issues highlighted. Overall, the quality of the 2 nannies provided to me are poor, not professional and do not appear to be well trained. Really regretted taking this agency.",2023-10-26T02:30:54.521Z,education

In the baby’s second month, he stayed up all night and slept sporadically in the day. Julie stayed up carrying baby all night despite being very tired, and used various methods to ensure that she was alert.
In two short months, Julie has become a part of our family. She gets along with everyone, including my mother in law and my helper. She is a joy and I strongly recommend her.

She was very responsive and put me with Nanny Yuzhu who really was a godsend for the family. She helped me tie over the second month with the newborn and 2 other young kids as I didn't get the rest I needed with the previous nanny from another agency.

Nanny yuzhu was very patient with the baby and proactive with the chores and setting up a good routine in the house. I have learnt much from watching how she handles the different things needed to be done in a typical day and am implementing it in my own routine now that she has left.

I also engaged with Gladys for lactation and postnatal massages.

I have continued to engage Gladys for my baby 3rd month. They have arranged Nanny Amy. Nanny Amy takes care of my twins very well too. She trained my babies to sleep longer which allow me to have more rest time. She sings and plays with my babies when they are awake.

My child looks forward to going to school everyday because she gets to be herself at school - and the teachers support each child for their strengths and weaknesses.

The teachers are also open to provide feedback on children, and will work with parents to help children develop (e.g. stop using pacifiers).

Parent engagement is also good, parents and families are invited to the Centre for key events like Hari Raya, Mothers’/Fathers’ Day to celebrate with the children.

The other non-teaching staff are also very friendly and are caring towards the children. Meals served are healthy and of good variety as well.

Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool at Ang Mo Kio,5,"As a first-time parent, I was so nervous about leaving my baby in someone else's care, but I couldn't be happier with our decision to enroll at this infant care center. The teachers are absolute angels—they're incredibly caring and professional, and it's clear they love what they do. The facility itself is spotless, bright, and so well-equipped, and I have complete peace of mind knowing my little one is in such a safe environment. With a fantastic 1:3 teacher-to-baby ratio, I know my child is getting all the personal attention they need to thrive.
The communication from the teachers is simply outstanding. They use an app that provides real-time updates on everything—from feeding and diaper changes to nap schedules. It’s so reassuring to get those notifications throughout the day. Plus, they always share photos of all the fun activities! We get to see our baby enjoying tummy time, playing with new toys, and interacting with their friends. It's truly a highlight of our day to see those little snapshots.
This center goes above and beyond to make every day special. They plan daily activities that are both fun and enriching, and they do an amazing job of organizing special cultural celebrations and holiday events. Getting those adorable photos of our baby in their holiday outfit is just the sweetest thing! This center is more than just a daycare; it's a supportive, loving community, and we couldn't be more grateful for the incredible care our baby receives.",2025-08-20T23:34:30.249Z,education

The teachers are great and communication is smooth, in person and via the app. Specifically, I’m impressed by their explanation on why my K1 can read the schools’s material confidently but not books in general, yet.

Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool at Ang Mo Kio,5,"We’ve had a wonderful experience with Sunny Bunny Montessori Infant Care :) It’s truly a great school with a warm and caring environment. The teachers are always smiling and genuinely attentive, which gave us so much peace of mind as parents.

One thing I really appreciated was how frequently they updated us with photos and little notes, those small gestures made a big difference. The two Principals are also very friendly and approachable, which made communication smooth and easy.

It’s with a heavy heart that we had to transfer our son to another centre due to personal reasons. We’ll definitely miss the Sunny Bunny family, and we’re so grateful for the love and care they’ve given. ❤️",2025-06-16T01:58:43.791Z,education
Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool at Ang Mo Kio,5,We enrolled our 18m daughter in Sunny Bunny 4 months ago and we’ve had a great experience with the school! The teachers are extremely warm and caring and genuinely love and care for our daughter. They are very happy to see her every morning and make her feel very welcome. She managed to stay in school for a full day on her first day and cried for less than a week - we believe this is testament to how the teachers have helped her settle into a completely new environment. We get very regular updates (and even photos of her eating and napping everyday). Teachers even specifically update us on what food she enjoys in particular in school so that we can offer it to her at home. She looks forward to going to school even on weekends and will try to put on her uniform. We also observed first hand how the teachers care for the children on excursions and how much the children love their teachers. Thank you teachers! She has also learnt a lot since she started school and is surprisingly proficient in Mandarin!

Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool at Ang Mo Kio,5,"My son transferred to Sunny Bunny 2 months ago, from a branded preschool. His change so far is impressing and very positive.

In the previous school he was reluctant to attend school and always asked us to pick him up on time. Now he is actually asking us to come later so that he can play more with his friends and teachers at school! I am so impressed by the kindness, and the bright smiles among all the teachers. No wonder my kid would like to stay at school.

That being said, it is not just the calm and happiness this school brings to my kid, but also I can see his enthusiasm in study is back, and continuously growing. His reading capability in both Chinese and English makes great progress, he now can entertain himself alone with his books! ( thank god, it gives me and my husband some quiet time😂)

It was a very painful decision to transfer our son to a new center but we wanted our boy to have a better grasp of the Chinese language as our family is primary English speaking. So far we are glad that we made the right choice.

Teacher Maria and Teacher Hu has gone above and beyond to welcome our boy from day one. The owner of the centre (Hui Ling) whose children are also attending the centre was very reassuring to us as parents as well.

The school has a great outdoor and indoor play area very suitable for kid's physical activities. They also have a in house cook that prepares meals for the kids. Our boy has put on a bit of weight since he join Sunny Bunny.

Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool at Ang Mo Kio,5,"I wanted to share our positive experience with Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool, especially for our son. He has been attending the school for the past four months, and we have noticed tremendous growth and development during this time.

Firstly, my son has adapted exceptionally well to the school environment within just two weeks. It's been heartwarming to witness his enthusiasm for going to school every day. He has even started sharing the names of his teachers with us, including TR Maria, Hu Lao Shi, Chen Lao Shi, and Aunty Kim. This shows that he has built a good rapport with the teachers and feels comfortable in their presence.

One thing that sets Sunny Bunny Montessori apart from other preschools we considered is the evident love and care provided by the teachers. The atmosphere at the school radiates warmth and positivity, making it a nurturing environment for children. It's reassuring as parents to know that our child is in such capable hands.

The school's curriculum and activities have also contributed to our son's growth. Through the pictures and videos shared on the school's application, we can see that he has daily playground sessions and afternoon language sessions, where he is exposed to Mandarin. It's truly impressive that he is already able to speak some Mandarin sentences.

My son's love for the school extends beyond the classroom. He often recites the songs he learns at school, especially the phonics songs, when he's at home and even before going to sleep. This demonstrates the positive impact the school's teachings have on his learning and enjoyment.

Lastly, we appreciate the monthly field trips organized by the school, which allow us as parents to tag along. These outings not only provide an opportunity for us to bond with Davian but also help us feel more involved in his preschool experience.

Overall, we are extremely pleased with Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool. The supportive teachers, engaging curriculum, and the sense of community make it a fantastic learning environment for our son. We highly recommend the school to other parents seeking a nurturing and holistic preschool for their children.",2024-04-25T09:02:59.256Z,education
Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool at Ang Mo Kio,5,"Very good pre-school from which my 5 kids graduated. This shows how consistent the school has been through the years in their quality of curriculum and educators. The school has a knack for hiring teachers with golden hearts- who truly care for the kids and desire the best for them. They stretch the kids but at the same time, their well-being comes first. The teachers genuinely love the kids and take pride in watching them progress through the years. It is a rare find- a gem of a school. Fees are high though not much higher than many private centres. With the strong curriculum, I do not need to spend extra to put my kids in enrichment centres and can spend quality time w them on precious weekends. And because of the excellent care, SBM has given me a peace of mind to know my kids are in very good hands which in priceless for a working mother.

Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool at Ang Mo Kio,5,"Sunny Bunny Montessori deserves 5 star good review. My son has been in the school for 2 months now and he is adjusting to school very well. He looks forward to going to school everyday and so far he didn’t get sick. Compared to the previous franchised pre school that we sent him to, he go sick every two weeks in the previous school and we were unable to send him for full day curriculum.

Sunny Bunny Montessori has very strong academic curriculum as well. My son develops cognitive and language skills quickly from the school curriculum. He can even recognise Chinese characters and enjoys reading. He develops good habits that he finds books to read on his own. He enjoys singing the songs learned from school and showcased to us when gets back home.

I can tell that the teachers are truly caring and my son loves all the teachers. He will repeat saying teacher Maria, chen laoshi, hu laoshi, teach Lindy at home.

The school also organises monthly excursion trips and my son also enjoys going to it. This creates valuable bonding time between the children and parents. The teachers also planned the itinerary very well, full of fun and something to take away.

I have been recommending the school to my friends though it is not a franchised school and very few people know about it. It is no doubt a hidden gem school which deserves all the 5 star reviews!",2024-03-05T05:11:38.318Z,education
Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool at Ang Mo Kio,5,"Our daughter went to Sunny Bunny when she was only 18 months old. At first, we were quite worried about whether she could adapt. It was during COVID then, and we seldom brought her out, so she became very attached to us so much so that when she goes to somewhere unfamiliar, she would became very nervous. But surprisingly, she adapted to life in Sunny Bunny very quickly and very well! Only a few weeks in, we could tell that she became more outgoing, more confident and more sociable. After 2 months when she was about 20 months old, we were confident enough to allow her to take the school bus on her own, and she enjoyed it very much. It was such a relief for us and we are very grateful to the school.

The teachers in Sunny Bunny are very caring. Special thanks to Teacher Maria and Chen Laoshi!! They're very patient, and attend to every child's individual needs. One of the many examples - Because my daughter usually takes a long time to finish her meals, Teacher Maria and Chen Laoshi would specially prepared small bite-sized apple cubes for my daughter. They would mix it into the rice, to encourage my daughter to chew more. They would  also always try to make sure that she finishes her food.

The overall environment in Sunny Bunny is very warm and welcoming. Thanks to the Montessori method, my daughter is familiar with all teachers and students in the school. She likes to take care of the younger ones and newer ones in school, just like how she had been taken care of when she first went to the school. She has a lot of friends in the school, and she even knows all their siblings by name as well!

Academic wise, Sunny Bunny is very strong, especially in the Chinese language. We were very pleased to see that my daughter was able to recognize a whole stack of Chinese characters, and able to read when she was 3 yo. There are other enrichment classes embedded into the curriculum, like Ping Pong class, Robotics, gym class, and these are all my daughter's favourites.

I would recommend Sunny Bunny to any parent who want their children to be in a caring school with strong academics and a fun curriculum.",2024-02-18T00:29:48.069Z,education

For parents still contemplating whether to enrol, this childcare centre is indeed a good choice. I had past experiences enrolling my 2 older ones in a branded childcare centre with many branches (many franchised) but had withdrawn them to join Sunny Bunny Montessori. When assessing a childcare centre, understanding the management’s commitment to taking care of staff and children’s needs is crucial.

Ever-since she joined Sunny Bunny Montessori, everyday she is looking forward to go school and every night she too excited to sleep.

Besides that, she also improving on her life skills such as button her own clothing, eating meal by herself. Her motor skills improved as well by doing a lot of outdoor gym and indoor ping pong and rock climbing.

The most surprising is that her Chinese from she doesn’t know how to speak and now she can even pronounce difficult chinese words and read in sentence and paragraph within a month.

And we also witness she dare to kick off diaper wit the encouragements from her loving teachers.

Sunny Bunny Montessori Preschool at Ang Mo Kio,5,"I send my 3 kids (2 boys and 1 girl) aged 2 years apart to Sunny Bunny Montessori since 2017. Most importantly, my kids received excellent preschool education with dedicated teachers & excellent facilities, especially with the Montessori way of imparting knowledge.

My eldest boy has special needs, and Sunny Bunny was able to conduct some early intervention techniques. I guess that is the wonder of the Montessori way.

Another aspect of Sunny Bunny is the Mandarin curriculum. Simply amazing. Every child is guaranteed to recognise 4000 Mandarin characters before entering Primary school. Their exposure to Mandarin at such a young age and ability to read Mandarin characters was astounding to me.

Sunny Bunny has robotics (they send teams to participate in the annual robotics competition), gym classes, table tennis, Mathematics, Mandarin, English ALL in the curriculum, and year end, the children are exposed to preparing for the annual year end concert cum graduation.

The toys/equipment used for the lessons are top notch. Even during the Covid years when HBL was implemented, all the teachers at Sunny Bunny conducted full day lessons everyday through HBL. There were no making up of excuses to close down the centre for a few days just because of Covid.

Now that my kids have graduated from Sunny Bunny, I feel almost sad that my kids have left an golden era of being so well-taken care of at Sunny Bunny.

MindChamps PreSchool @ Punggol Digital District,5,"I had a very positive experience attending the recent MRW workshop organized by the school. The workshop was incredibly helpful in giving us, as parents, a clearer understanding of how teachers conduct lessons in class and what our children are currently learning. It also provided practical tips on how we can support our child’s learning at home.

I would like to especially commend Ms Katherine for her patience and dedication. She took the time to guide us through the online learning platform and shared valuable suggestions on how to help our children at home. I also truly appreciate the effort she made to show my child’s learning video in class, which I believe has boosted her confidence greatly.

This experience reminded me of the importance of revising the content at home with our children. Reinforcing what they’ve learned in school not only strengthens their understanding but also builds a strong foundation for their continued learning journey.",2025-07-10T06:01:00.737Z,education

COURTS Orchard,1,"Staff are not very helpful and not knowledgeable about their products and offerings. Even small 7eleven store cashiers are better than these lazy staff.

I bought a camera here that will be used as a gift. No one was around to help, so I went to the cashier area and asked someone to sell the item to me. I specifically asked if the item I will be buying can be returned as I don't want to open the box since it will be a gift I will give on my overseas trip. The guy who helped me said it could be returned after 14 days. I counted my overseas trip days, and if ever there is a defect, I can still return it after my trip.

Armed with this info, I immediately paid for the item. When I double-checked with the cashier about the return policy, much to my surprise, he said the item only has a 1 week return policy. I argued that they falsely provided sales terms and misled me into buying the item. As a compromise, I asked if they could test it instead, though I am hesitant since I want the box sealed when I give my gift - but to add to the incompetence so far, they said they don't have a dedicated salesperson who can test it.

Since they have no solutions for me and we just stared at each other for minutes with no one offering even a simple apology, much less a work around the issue, I just opted to refund the item.

When the person who will process my refund came and asked the guy if I would need a refund, the guy even had the gall to tell her I changed my mind. I didn't let it pass since they are the one who changed the terms of sale right there, not me. Stores usually get sued and fined for this kind of misleading sales, but the staff are not even bothered by the mistake and incompetence they just displayed. In any other setup, this kind of attitude leads to suspension or even dismissal, but I guess Courts Orchard management is satisfied with being mediocre and incompetent.",2025-02-26T15:34:22.297Z,retail

Samsung Experience Store,1,"On 10 April 2024, visited the store to fix Zfold4 screen protector lifting off in the middle in less than a year since purchase. Had to pay $30 for a new screen protector as I am not sure if we can do it elsewhere without negating the warranty. It would be free with Samsung Care.

The service was prompt without long queue, fixed within an hour. However, the fix came with a big disclaimer - there will be no warranty on the new protector even if bubbles develop within a few days. What kind of confidence is that coming from the brand?

As a long time user of Samsung for more than a decade, it is appreciated that a free protector was given with the phone. However, to see that the cover failed within a year, I can't help but cast doubts over the longer term reliability of ZFold4. What if the screen starts to crack after the warranty period? I have S8 that is still usable but it would seem that fancy ZFold4 may not last as long.

Recommended to consider Samsung Care.

10 May 2024 - sadly another visit to fix Z Fold 4 is needed. Inner display stopped working. Still within warranty but it is a waste of time. Samsung Care can't be added. Sent in 11am, collected before 4pm. Excellent working condition for now. But 1 Yr warranty expiring next month, can the phone last another year even? Explore trade in options? Clearly fold design  is far from reliable.

5 June 2025: Samsung Z Fold 4 inner screen sudden death! I have used Samsung phones since 2013, even the S8 is still working without issues. How can Samsung sell fold phones that are so unreliable!? It is so expensive to fix it.

August 2025. Pink line across the outer screen. Let's see how bad can zfold4 ends up.",2025-08-22T11:01:15.718Z,retail

Lite Mobile,1,"Rating: 1/5 Stars ⭐️

Saw LiteMobile on TikTok FYP for a burn mark on my LCD screen. Went to their branch, got the repair with a ""3-month warranty."" I pointed out a scratch immediately, but they said it was just dirt! Now there's a bright white spot that wasn't there before! 😩 The manufacturer is just rabak!

Their customer service (via WhatsApp) is APPALLING. Instant replies from another's phone pretending to be a new customer, but ""bohlayan"" when I tried to claim my warranty. After ranting to ""Desmond"" on WhatsApp, he offered a refund AND a new LCD. I refused because their rabak customer service made me lose all trust. They suddenly claimed my phone had a bloated battery and could damage the screen, wanting to ""check"" it. Sketchy!

LiteMobile needs to prioritize warranty claims and acknowledge issues instead of dismissing them. First and last time customer here. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else!

Honor Service Centre (Singapore),2,"I purchased the Honor Magic 7 Pro in March 2025, and by August (just 6 months later), I noticed visible gaps between the back panel and frame of the phone. I’ve never dropped or mishandled the device, so this clearly looks like a manufacturing or assembly defect.

When I went to the Honor service centre, they only applied GX glue to seal the gap. For a premium flagship phone, this is not an acceptable solution — especially within such a short time after purchase.

This kind of issue affects build quality, waterproofing, and long-term durability. I expected a proper fix or a replacement, not a quick patch-up job. Honor should stand behind its products, especially when they fail within the Lemon Law period.

bossini Downtown East,5,"Bossini (Downtown East):  A Great Find for Couple-Wear (5/5 Stars)

Rating:

• Products: 5/5 (Adorable shirts, great variety)
• Service: 5/5 (Incredibly friendly and helpful staff)
• Atmosphere: 4/5 (Clean and organized, inviting atmosphere)
• Value: 5/5 (Amazing deal on a couple's outfit)

Overall: 5/5

Last week, Donkey and I cycled down to Downtown East for a little exploration. It had been a while since we'd been there, and we wanted to see what was new.  We passed by Bossini and were drawn in by the colorful display of clothes.

I was immediately intrigued by two shirts worn by the mannequins. The guy's shirt featured a big B, and the girl's shirt had a big ""G"" on it.  I thought it was very cute and maybe represented ""boy"" and ""girl"" in fashion, but also the initials of my name. I had been pestering Donkey to get the shirts as a couple wear for a few days.  He didn't want to disappoint me, so we cycled back to Downtown East to get them.

bossini Downtown East,4,"Last week, Kitty and I cycled down to Downtown East for a little exploration. It had been a while since we'd been there, and we wanted to see what was new.  We passed by Bossini and were drawn in by the colorful display of clothes.

Kitty was immediately intrigued by two shirts worn by the mannequins. The guy's shirt featured a big B, and the girl's shirt had a big ""G"" on it.  She thought it was very cute and maybe represented ""boy"" and ""girl"" in fashion, but also the initials of her name. She had been pestering me to get the shirts as a couple wear for a few days.  I didn't want to disappoint her, so we cycled back to Downtown East to get them.

We arrived around 9:30 pm, just as the shop was preparing to close.  However, the staff was incredibly friendly and told us to take our time browsing while he did his closing duties.

Seems like some coverup is going on.  More than 1 week has passed and I have yet to receive my refund despite many chasers issued to them.  Pls avoid this retailer.",2019-01-19T16:26:16.676Z,retail

One was wearing glasses and he did the pre-checks while patiently informing me each time he did anything on the phone. Repair was done on the spot with abt 2 hour waiting. Post-check was done by the second young chap with a stylish hair and nice voice. He made sure my phone and its internal components were all fine. Even cleaned the phone well.

FitFlop,5,"Fantastic service by the male Chinese staff on shift on May 4th as well as Ricci too. Both of them showed what teamwork is about as staff representing the brand of Fitflop in Waterway Point.

I tried on 3 different pair of shoes, while my Mom tried on one pair. He was still very polite and nice to service us. We took a while, then decided to buy socks from other shops in Waterway Point so we know we will get the right fit.

We specifically told the male Chinese staff, sorry I didn't catch your name, to put it aside and he did.

By the time we return with socks, the male Chinese staff did his job of handover well because Ricci was in aware and served us immediately with proper follow-up.

I was porting between 2 telecomns and didn't have data on my phone, but Ricci allowed me to use her phone as a WiFI hotspot so I could obtain Fraser points while buying the 2 pairs of shoes.

Did a static fit previously from elsewhere but after few months I start to realise that I am not fully utilising (glutes, hamstring etc) and mostly only using quads. As a result, I always feel that my quads fatigue all the time during and after rides and keep getting dropped on climbs.

After I went for my first Retul Fit by Mr Ironman Jack, found out that my saddle was way too low, saddle wrong size and stem too low (wanna act pro I go and slam) hence affecting my pedaling efficiency, comfort and overall ride quality.

The fit was done according to Retul recommended stats and or course with Jack’s experience and adjustments, I went for 2 50+ KM rides with moderate and high intensity. Immediately noticed that I’m way comfortable, average power has increased with little to no leg fatigue even after a hard ride I went home with no cramps or pains and I no longer feel the burning sensation on my quads during inclines or climb.

I was told it costs 20cents per page during the two phone calls at two different times by two different people.  However, after all the trouble to have finally found the shop, (as I do not stay in this area),  I was told an additional charge of $1 on top of the number of pages to be printed.  She was totally uncompassionate about my wasted trip to her shop based on the twice quoted price of 20 cents per page printing from my thumbdrive.  I felt so disrespected, cheated and treated rudely by the female middle-aged shop owner / attendant.  I would never go to this shop for my stationery needs.

Line Stationery Gifts & Toys,2,"Line stationery has always been my go-to store. A place where I'd travel to happily to get my pens, refills and other miscellaneous items. Most of the time, I would go there for their printing services.

I am usually graced by the very friendly uncle who would not only do a good job at helping me print my stuffs but also gave me cheaper rate (because he knows I'm a student). Today, I experienced one of the most unsettling encounter with a lady who works there.

When I told her that I wanted to print some stuffs, she handed me the blue laptop for me to do it on my own - saying ""you can do on your own right?"" - which surprised me because that's not how the uncle does it. When the laptop was booting up, she ignored me and started chatting away with what seems to be a colleague/ a friend. Not that I mind, but the account was locked out and she didn't even bother to tell me that the password can be found on the paper that was sticked onto the laptop. ""It's there what?"" + pointing at the paper without any apology was what I had as a response when I told her that the account was locked.  But what irked me alot was the look she gave - the look that I should have known it was there and those eyes which seemingly said please do not bother me any further.

I am also disappointed that she couldn't help me further with the printing because I was unsure with the printing layout - which she could only solve by calling her boss. And right after that, she wanted to charge me for 18 pieces instead of 9 because she didn't bother to count until I told her to.

Customer experience is what drives customer loyalty. I had a very bad experience here.",2021-10-08T04:43:16.319Z,retail

Arden Teal,5,"I recently picked up the Arden Teal Calafate Straight Cap Walnut Oxford and I have to say, it’s easily one of the best dress shoes I’ve owned. What really stood out to me was how much attention to detail the team had put into the shoe. From the hand-painted, hand-burnished Argentinean calfskin leather to the subtle nuances in the finish, you can tell every pair is crafted with care and pride.

Mabir was also incredibly knowledgeable and took the time to walk me through the features and care tips, which made the whole experience feel very personal.

But the best part? The comfort. I wore them straight out of the box for a pre-wedding photoshoot and was genuinely surprised at how comfortable they were. No break-in period needed at all! The leather padded insole and quality lining make a huge difference, and I didn’t get any of the usual pinching or soreness you sometimes get with new Oxfords.

If you’re looking for a pair of classic, well-made dress shoes that look sharp and feel great from day one, I highly recommend giving these a try. Worth every cent!",2025-07-13T03:58:05.083Z,retail

Star Living @ Serangoon North,5,"I am completely blown away by CK's service. He went above and beyond to serve me and my mum even though he was the only sales person working that day. I could see that he also gave full attention to another customer before us. I had a bad experience at HipVan earlier on as I was ignored by the only staff there so it was a delightful change at STAR living. When my mum and I first walked into the store, we immediately liked what we saw. The dining tables were modern and stylish, and the pricing was surprisingly affordable. CK was extraordinary because he gave us a lot of inputs and suggestions when we felt unsure which chair to pick that would go with the dining table. CK took time to explain about each design's different quality and material. It was obvious that he had a lot of experience. I ended up getting a sofa bed, a dining table and chairs, and two office chairs. Another benefit of coming to Star Living is that it shares its premises with King Koil, so it's a one-stop shop for those who want to buy beds and mattresses as well. Candy, the sales lady at King Koil, was also very delightful and sweet. It's too bad that I already bought a King Koil bed elsewhere 2 days ago. STAR Living has won me over!

Smartbed Signature @ Serangoon,1,"I had a terrible experience purchasing a bed frame from SmartBed's Signature @ Serangoon outlet, and I want to warn others about the poor service I received from their salesperson, Malvin.

I ordered a king-size sit in bed frame, which was clearly discussed multiple times with Malvin at the store. My mattress at home is a king size, so there was no reason to order anything smaller. However, when he wrote up the sales order, he inexplicably noted it as a 5ft frame—which, unbeknownst to me at the time, is a queen size. As customers, how are we supposed to know these technical details like ""5ft"" equals queen? Malvin even reviewed the sales order with us and referred to it as a king-size bed frame, so we trusted him.

On the delivery day, a queen-size bed frame was delivered instead of the king size we agreed on. When I confronted Malvin about this error, he refused to take responsibility for his mistake. Instead of offering a proper resolution or compensation, he suggested that I buy a queen-size mattress at their ""cost price"" to solve the issue. How am I supposed to know what their actual cost price is? This was their mistake, and yet I’m expected to spend more money to fix it?

The bed frame is a sit-in bed, meaning the mattress sits inside the frame itself. This makes the problem even worse because my king-size mattress now doesn’t fit properly in the queen-size bed frame.

The worst part is that I had asked my interior designer to build side tables based on the measurements Malvin provided for the queen-size bed frame. Now, my bed frame doesn’t fit with my king-size mattress, and my renovation is already completed with no way to adjust. His carelessness has completely disrupted my plans and left me with a mess that I have to figure out how to fix.

This situation has been incredibly frustrating, and I wouldn’t want anyone else to go through what I did. If you’re buying a bed frame or mattress from SmartBed, please make sure the salesperson writes down ""king"" or ""queen"" explicitly on the sales order. Don’t rely on verbal agreements or trust them to get it right.

Lesson learned for me, but I will never shop at SmartBed again.",2024-12-23T02:23:32.962Z,retail

T For Toys - Toy Store,1,Super rude owner/shop attendant. Don't bother coming here - condescending attitude and the worst part is everything is overpriced you can find cheaper and similar Made in China quality in HDB shops or shoppee/online. And definitely don't bring your kids- she chases you out and tells your kids off. She's better off not running a toy store - don't put toys out to play if you're going to get upset with kids playing.

T For Toys - Toy Store,5,"We visited T for Toys based on the impressive Google reviews and weren't disappointed. More than a mere toy warehouse, it emerges as a meticulously organised and clean haven for children and parents alike. My visit on 30th Sept, revealed rows of neatly stacked, individually packed toys, all maintained in a temperature-controlled environment, ensuring quality preservation.

The staff, particularly Auntie Monica (hope I got her name right), deserve a special mention for not only being knowledgeable about the products but also for engaging and entertaining my kids with intriguing toys, allowing me to consult what to buy comfortably with my wife over the phone. The toys, while not your typical branded products, are of commendable quality, offering a wide array of options from wooden fruits to high-quality plastic homeware, costumes to educational STEM sets, and more. We departed with a handful including kitchen sets, wash basins, medical sets, tea sets and more, much to the kids delight. The only gripe is the purchase process, where you'll still need to visit their website to select, check out and pay. While it does take some time, we weren't in a rush and the staff were helpful throughout.

T for Toys is a unique and delightful shopping experience, with well-categorised toys and easy aisles. House brands dominate the store, giving the it a similar experience to a Decathlon but for toys. Definitely recommendable for quality, variety, and exceptional service! It won't be long before we make a return visit.",2023-10-05T12:01:03.334Z,retail

Brought a colleague here. She was happy to be able to purchase stuff for her niece and nephew (8yo). I bought another gift for my friend's 9yo daughter.
The family games are quite interesting too. But I think can stock more games for older people.

7 July 2023
My first time here. Was looking for a gift for a friend's 9yo daughter and found this on Google. The reviews were pretty solid so I decided to give it a try. Texted at the WhatsApp number given and whoever it was who answered was really helpful.
Dropped by the store to have a look see. Monica was really helpful. They have a pretty good range of stuff, quite reasonably priced too. However, do note that it is an online purchase store, and this place is just their warehouse, so you'd still have to order and make payment online.
Spent $59 for 5 games. Quite reasonable.
Would've liked to have more toys for older kids though. Most of what I saw were 3+, 5+, 8+. How about 12+, 15+, 18+ too?",2023-08-02T04:58:55.341Z,retail

Novena (Tampines),1,"Worse place to get furnitures. Somewhere during April, i purchased a queen size bed and wardrobe and was attended by this sales person Julie. After purchasing, she informed that there was no stock for the bed in the warehouse at that moment and I would had to wait till early June. Didn’t have the decency to inform before i paid for it so i had no choice but to agree. During early june, there was no news about it. I had to constantly keep calling her instead of her calling me to update. All i got was “the stock haven’t arrived yet. I call my manager then update u again.” Still, no update from her. After that, i had called her multiple times and asked for a refund and i was told “sorry we cannot refund u”. Hence i called the main office n i was told the same thing “no stock now. We don’t know when will arrive”… what is this??? After 2 weeks, still no update from anyone. Hence, i emailed in to the customer care service and there was no reply as well. After multiple emails n saying that I would bring this matter up to CASE, finally they replied and finally Julie called. Telling me that she “HELPED” me to negotiate with her manager to exchange the bed frame to a more expensive one. When the goods finally arrived, there were some defects on my wardrobe door. Again, i was told to wait for the replacement door. And now, they said the replacement part has arrived and they have to bring back that defect door to replace the aluminium part instead of replacing the whole door for me (which was told to me initially). Never again will I buy stuffs from Novena Tampines anymore and I would not recommend any of my family and friends to go there. Worse after sales service I have ever encountered.",2025-08-22T02:04:59.553Z,retail

Urban Mood,4,"The on-site delivery team: 5 stars - arrived and finished on-time within the 5-hour delivery window, were super professional and friendly. They did the assembly job quickly and even helped to wipe it down somewhat due to wood shavings created from drilling assembly.

The Lien bed itself is attractive, and at a decent price point. Finished product (wood slabs) was good, not amazing, but decent for the price. Storage hydraulic is a little jerky, but overall the bed offers significant storage, though it may not be practically accessible given how heavy a king mattress will be on top - so the 2 small drawers design is useful.

But the online website and sales process needs improvement. The website is misleading, it shows choice of colors and size that may already be discontinued or out of stock. Expect some conversation with customer service.

There is shipment tracking but product came from China via sea freight so between the factory production time, any inclement weather and customs clearance, be prepared to wait a bit for your purchase. And be ready to receive the item, or else the next batch delivery might not be for another 2 weeks.",2025-08-26T16:33:14.221Z,retail

POPULAR Bookstore,1,"I recently visited the Popular Bookstore and was left incredibly frustrated. Firstly, the queue at the counter was excessively long with only one cashier serving customers. This resulted in a significant wait time, which was incredibly inconvenient. I ended up waiting a full 15 minutes for a purchase that amounted to only $6.

Secondly, the store itself was poorly organized. Items were strewn about, creating a chaotic and cluttered atmosphere. The labeling of sections was also confusing, making it difficult to find specific books or products.
I hope the store management addresses these issues to improve the customer experience.

Overall, my experience at Popular Bookstore was disappointing. The long wait times and poor organization significantly detracted from what should have been a pleasant purchase experience.",2025-01-02T09:04:11.232Z,retail

Sengkang Books & Stationeries,1,"HONESTLY : ZERO STARS

horrible horrible staff. Wanted to bind 7 books and arrived at 6pm. They close at 9pm and told me they can't bind it, not enough time because they are closing up soon. Tomorrow then come back. Hello? You close at 9pm but can still say wont have enough time to bind? In the midst of this all, the staff dare to get angry and throw my papers around. Messed up my papers until all of the papers have to be reorganised again to be binded. Extra work for me. Horrible service!!! Wont ever recommend. It's obvious they are too lazy to get any work done. All they do is chit chat and barely tend to any customers. I know it wont take that long to bind as I went there last week and they made a huge fuss about it aswell. Said it will take 1 hour+ to bind 3 books. We got angry and told them we wont go anywhere and we waited there till they finished. Only then did they do it and finish all 3 books in 10mins. So its not a matter of long or not. They just don't want to because they are too lazy. Even when my 5 year old was holding onto a toy, one of the staff had the audacity to ask her to put it down if we weren't planning on buying it. With that kind of attitude, trust me, had I wanted to purchase her that toy, I WOULD HAVE NEVER SPENT A DOLLAR MORE DUE TO THEIR SERVICE. Now after this second chance, even more so I WILL NOT SPEND ANY MORE MONEY THERE ANYMORE. Will go down to the other printing store at Cheng San Centre instead.",2025-08-20T10:44:33.652Z,retail

The staff told me they do not have thicker paper unless I buy 1 packet of the paper from their shop which costs $5 and they will use that to print for me. I was fine with it so was willing to pay the $5. However, when the staff printed the certificate for me, there was white borders and grid lines water mark on the paper. I questioned why is there watermark and the staff actually told me she was not sure as she printed directly from my file. As for the borders, she cannot do anything to resize. I was quite upset about this as my document was not properly printed so I told her never mind, I don’t want to proceed printing anymore of my files. The staff then told me regardless I will still need to pay $5+$1 (for printing) as she already printed. Attitude and service was bad, not to mentioned I did not get to print my files in the end which is a waste of my time and money.",2025-07-18T06:08:13.261Z,retail

Sengkang Books & Stationeries,1,"I will not recommend at all and to think that I a would come here from time to time to have my docs printed. If I could, I will not give any star at all.

Started when the lady asked me if I have already sent the docs for printing since it doesn’t appear on their gmail. (She commented: I cannot print if you didn’t send the email you know?)

When the docs were already with her for viewing, gave her instructions which pages to omit (She remarked: wah, you cannot check your phone for which pages to print)?

While waiting, I asked if the docs were really printing because I cannot hear the copier, she then made me come near to the copier and told me “See that, you’re asking me print 200 plus pages of course your docs haven’t come out mah)

Proceeds to go their cashier and call me stupid.

I paid $135 for the docs, mind you and this is the customer service you’re treating me?!?!

Pictured is the lady with specs carrying her white water bottle who called me stupid.

Sengkang Books & Stationeries,5,To counter one of the poor review earlier. Price for the print are clearly stated on the printer. It's a old school shop in a old plaza and the cashiers are all simple and nice people. 50 cent is for digital print which they have to retrieve from email. Photocopy is 20 cent. Overall a nice shop to visit if you need something urgent and not too many copies. Definitely not for those with sense of self entitlement and expect to be served like bosses.,2024-12-13T07:07:48.400Z,retail
Sengkang Books & Stationeries,1,"Photocopy and printing services are overpriced.

Its the only photocopy shop in the neighbourhood, so theres a monopoly here.",2024-07-08T03:33:39.427Z,retail
Sengkang Books & Stationeries,1,"I would give a negative rating if I could. I recently visited the shop and was extremely disappointed with their pricing and overall service. They charge an outrageous $0.50 per piece of paper (Black & White), even if you print on both sides! This is completely unreasonable, especially considering that double-sided printing should cost less since it saves paper.

Moreover, the staff did not provide a total price before printing and then demanded payment upfront, leaving you with no option but to accept the printed documents. I walked away as it was too expensive and did not accept the offer because they did not seek my consent with the pricing before printing. Under contract law, I am not legally bound to pay for papers they printed without my agreement.

Additionally, the shop appeared to be run by a group of young Malaysians who seemed to be secondary school students, based on their accents and appearance. I would highly suggest the authorities to look into their employment. Avoid this place if you’re looking for fair pricing and transparent service.",2024-05-28T06:34:08.822Z,retail

POPULAR Bookstore,1,"I approached an Indian lady staff member and told her I wanted to exchange two Harry Potter books for other items, as I had bought the wrong ones. I specifically mentioned that the books were from the NEX outlet, and she nodded, confirming it was okay.

At around 3:04 PM, I selected multiple products worth $29.91 and returned to the same staff member to process the exchange. I clearly stated, “I want to exchange the Harry Potter books for these items.” She acknowledged this and called an older woman for assistance.

The older woman informed me that opened books (one of mine had its plastic packaging removed) could not be exchanged in the future. She then repeatedly asked if these were the books I wanted to exchange, and I confirmed. She instructed me to get another first Harry Potter book, which I assumed was for scanning purposes, so I retrieved a sealed copy.

After scanning both books, she calculated the total as $29.91. Everything seemed fine until she asked the Indian staff member to complete the transaction. However, instead of processing the exchange, the Indian lady scanned all my items and charged me for them. I paid without realizing the mistake and then asked, “Wait, if this is an exchange, shouldn’t I not be paying?”

She called back the older woman, who became visibly irritated and snapped, “I asked you multiple times if these were the books you wanted to exchange. You said you bought the wrong book and wanted to exchange it for the one you brought me.”

At this point, my friend stepped in and clarified, “She’s here to exchange the books she bought from NEX for other products here.” The older woman suddenly realized her mistake—despite me having mentioned earlier that the books were from NEX. She had not understood this and had assumed I only wanted to swap the books for different editions. Frustrated, she grabbed the Harry Potter book and threw it into a basket before processing my refund.

Her tone then became calmer, but the items I had chosen did not add up exactly to $29.91, so my friend and I had to pick out additional candy to match the amount. Despite adding two sweets, the total was still short, and the older woman, now visibly annoyed, signaled her frustration to the Indian lady.

Eventually, we selected four sweets, bringing the total to $30.21, requiring me to pay an extra $0.30. Even after completing the transaction, the older woman continued displaying attitude and signaling her irritation.

I needed one at the office as I just went for spinal surgery and I was told I should not be sitting down too long daily and to get a standing deck.
Well, the day came and after a quick installation, the table and chair are now my best friends at work. I can quickly transition from sitting and standing with my presets and did I mention it is virtually noiseless?
So i now have 3 APOL products and I am a fan for life. Excuse me while I go lounge in my chair.
OH, and a shout-out to the very friendly uncle and auntie that assisted in the assembly. I felt really bad that I could not assist in carrying and shifting the table as I was recovering from surgery.",2024-06-08T07:49:25.768Z,retail
APOL Singapore,5,"I have done some research on ergonomic chairs and decided to give APOL a try. I was served by Kelly. She’s very friendly, professional and knowledgeable of the products. I tried both the Kraken and the Aevum at the showroom and I fell love with Aevum immediately because it was spacious for my size and so comfortable. I also loved that I could tilt all the way back. I can imagine myself napping on it after working for a period of time. The chair would definitely meet my needs of working from home for extended periods of time. Will update again once I have used it for a while, but I’m pretty sure it will be good.",2024-06-03T03:46:13.415Z,retail

I get it, working retail can be tough, but a little friendliness goes a long way, especially when you're dealing with kids and their parents. I've asked for recommendations, help finding specific books which could be found at other outlets but not here, and the responses have been short, dismissive, or just plain unhelpful.

It's a shame because the bookshop itself is lovely & could use some sales from time to time (i hope). If they could just improve the customer service, this place would be a gem. As it is, I'm hesitant to go back, which is a shame.",2025-05-18T06:55:58.581Z,retail

Nurul, you mentioned you need a few days to revert  but it has been 16 days Ihave yet to reveceived your email. This is very dissapointing from your assurance you will write back to me.
____________________________________
After my above updated comment(20th June), I called up and spoke to Nurul and  was told she is still waiting for the Com. Side to revert. That means as a consumer being told to give them a few days  but no email and I have to assume they will eventually get back to me, whenever that will be. So no need from their side to update me the status, but just wait and wait and wait till I forget?
Puma, JD and other sports retail outlets are so on top of their game. This is a small issue that can be resolved in a matter of minutes.
Managememt of Adidas, I told Nurul, I give you two more days  to revert. Apologise due to your manner in handling such matters your rating just gone down. Please have a look how the adidas team manages at Changi City point or Orchard.",2024-06-20T11:22:26.006Z,retail

JD Sports,1,"Dear JD Sports manager,

I am writing to express my disappointment with the service I received from one of your cashiers on 12.2.2025, at approximately 8:30 pm. (Yesterday)

During my visit, I felt that the cashier's attitude was unfriendly. She appeared unhappy and displayed a negative demeanor while assisting me. Specifically, when packing the shoes and socks I purchased, her facial expression seemed particularly displeased.

I hope you will investigate this matter and take necessary steps to improve the cashier's service. I look forward to receiving better service during my future visits to your store.

Thank you for your attention to this matter
Sincerely,

Aley",2025-02-13T15:32:54.307Z,retail

The products are of excellent quality, stylish, and comfortable.

The Air Jordan shoes are, as expected, top-notch—comfortable and perfect for both casual wear and sports.

Taking into consideration there was no feedback emailed as official complaint that permits them to take customers for granted, chances were given in vain.

They will never apologise especially after defective goods are sold. Before that they are eager to sell. After which is irresponsibility. In fact, they taunted customer till this feedback has to be generated as review.

Again, episode is repeated ( a customer service staff named A since left )

No surprise they pretended to want to serve over the line then proceeded to twist the words to their benefit; bombarded the customer over a call to mock consumer repeatedly. 5 times in total. Customer is their joke.

Taken for granted, insulted and to humiliate.

This is conduct of that customer service staff name D. Just business to them. Sums in retail. Imagine the rest of consumers going through that particular customer service, a paid job at that.  Read the rest of their reviews as proofs, please.

That’s quite a number of black sheeps and negative experiences are reported on social media. Facts are facts. Rude staff, toxic work cultures and negative customer service in their company.

They ignored, lied about their words and used it against customer, assuming no one will hear about it. Rather despicable and absurd for their condescending behaviour. Using the customer so hypocritically like a sale of merchandise?

She shows genuine dedication to her job and is also very friendly, striking up a conversation with me and answering any questions I had.

"Toys""R""Us - Waterway Point",1,"I would give zero stars to this Toys""R""Us. The staff, especially the on shift manager's performance needs to be reviewed by the senior management. If Toysrus as a global brand does not offer gift wrapping or has no stock of wrapping paper, then there should be a big sign and the cashiers should inform this to the customers before the item is bought. Not once the payment is made and then tell them. This seems like a ploy to take the money and then not offer a refund when the customer has been fooled about a typical service which should be offered (has been as well) by one of the biggest gift retailers globally. Even when I went out to buy a wrapper from kiddy palace and returned to request them to wrap it, they refused the service. So shame on you, it's a lie then that you're out of stock of wrapping paper, the truth is, you just simply don't want to wrap gifts. Therefore, you should make this clear as it will define the customers choice or weather or not to patronise your merchandise.",2024-12-29T05:50:38.442Z,retail

was there on 18/12/24 at around 5+pm, went to the cashier and one aunty and her husband cut my queue (COUNTER ONE). seeing that, i was frustrated and went in front of them because i was there first. the cashier didn’t see this happen, so when he turned back, he only saw me cutting in front of the aunty and uncle (as i should have), and so i said “sorry, i was here first”, and he gave me a dirty look. he then proceeded to scan my item and threw it on the table for me. very rude cashier, can check CCTV, he’s a young malay guy probably around 16-19 years old. don’t know why i was being treated that way when i was just trying to fight for myself.",2024-12-19T15:52:08.964Z,retail

The employees seemed to have forgotten that their shop caters to many young, impressionable children.

When I asked them to stop using so much profanity in front of children, a third cashier, who knew I was talking about her colleagues, pretended not to hear me. All three of them ignored me as I made my payment. Asked to talk to their manager and their attitude did not change, not even embarrassed about their behaviour.

I went to their Tampines studio for the QYOP weekend not knowing what to expect but it was a very enjoyable time at her studio. No hardselling, no pressure, totally overstayed beyond the slot I booked because of my own indecisiveness but it was such a friendly atmosphere that I felt like I was hanging out at a friend’s house. Instead of buying the items available under QYOP, I decided to custom order an armchair and a mirror. Honestly I did plenty of research and shopping before this so I knew the armchair was a GREAT price even for customisation. It was around the same price for  something I shortlisted on TB but here I could do a quality check and got the wonderful design advice from Desiree! She also sent photo updates from the factory and when I was concerned about whether the right colour was made, she double checked to assure me. When my items arrived, it totally elevated my apartment. Desiree has a great eye for design, and amazing customer service!! She was so patient to work around my messy schedule and got her delivery man to send it even late at night when I was finally home. What a boss babe! Can’t wait to custom more things from Desiree next time.",2025-05-11T09:19:30.222Z,retail
The Happy Place Studio,5,"I got to know The Happy Place 4 years ago.  I customised a round 900mm dining table with a sintered top.  As I had a set of dining chairs I liked to use along with the dining table, Desiree spared no effort to help me find the closest walnut shade to the dining chairs.  Fast forward 4 years later, the dining table is still in a good condition and I continue to use it at a coffee corner in my new home.

I returned to The Happy Place again 2 months ago, after failing to find affordable pieces of furniture that fits the theme of my new home without breaking the bank.  Desiree helped me customised the furniture (dining set with storage bench, ottoman, lounger chair and a travertine bedside table) in accordance to my theme of my new home.  Seeing how the furniture from The Happy Place blends in my new home brought joy to my family.

Throughout the waiting process, I received constant updates on the manufacturing of the furniture and Desiree helped me timed the delivery together ahead of my housewarming party.  The furniture arrived in good condition, delivery and installation team were helpful and friendly.

My only regret was not purchasing room dividers from The Happy Place!  I will certainly recommend The Happy Place and if I need furniture in future, I would not hesitate reaching out to them first.

IKEA Tampines,1,"Staff👎👎. I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding the unpleasant experience my partner and I had at your store. On Aug 26, 2025 time around 3:30pm.  We visited  IKEA Tampines/Alexandra to ask for assistance regarding delivery arrangements.

While we approached the staff politely and asked our questions respectfully, the staff member’s response and attitude were extremely disappointing. Although they provided the information we requested, the manner in which they spoke was dismissive and disrespectful, as if we were inconveniencing them or asking for a favor rather than being paying customers.

Their tone and attitude made us feel unwelcome, undervalued, and uncomfortable. We believe that customer service should be delivered with professionalism, courtesy, and respect — especially from a staff member whose role is to assist customers. Unfortunately, this experience fell far below our expectations of IKEA’s well-known customer service standards.",2025-08-26T09:43:35.787Z,retail

I didn’t make the purchase immediately but next day I contacted him and decide that is what I want and it comes with 4 chairs which he recommended me the colour. I paid through GrabPay without having to go down physically to the store again which is great.

After sales service is also good. I thought my table had scratches after using it for less than a month since I can’t wipe it off, and asked James about it and he recommended me to use Cif cleaner mix with water, and viola the lines disappeared. So it’s as good as new.

2. Incompetent staff. I have to be the one correcting them. They don't have information immediately and have to check their ipad repeatedly. While speaking, other staff interrupt our conversations regarding doubts, don't they all have the same experience? Can't they resolve problems by themselves?
3. Trade in prices are poor and old. Wanted to trade in a basically new phone for a used but pristine phone. Bought phone for 1300. Will get up to 750 if trading in opened and activated within 14 days. Okay sure I thought to myself even though it was almost half the original price because of a phone I wanted which was 850 pristine used. Upon giving it. They say it's used and come down to 650. What nonsense. That other phone I want is also used and it's only going for 1000 brand new online same with my phone which also goes for 1000+ online. 650 for a flagship phone that was opened and activated under 14 days and is purely clean with no marks scuffs etc and 848 for a phone that is 4 months old, with mild wear and tear and has only a few months of warranty left is poor pricing given the price you can get these phones for brand new. Update your trade in prices and used phone prices keeping in mind the cost of the phones brand new. Was looking forward to getting that phone so much so that I was willing to accept the 848 asking price. But trade in of 650 for a practically new phone is upsetting.
4. Asked sales rep to get manager to discuss this. Sales rep says just keep your phone. Did I ask? And If I wanted to why would I come to this store. Once rep went to get manager, manager is apparently so busy that he used this sales rep as a messenger to go back and forth.  Manager must be busier than Tim Cook.
5. I was appalled by this lack of support and service and that I couldn't get the device I wanted.
6. I gave one star just for your repair services. You only charge for the repair if you can properly diagnose and fix the issue. I didn't test this but other positive reviews support it.
7. Negotiation is non existent. They follow fixed prices made up by some other department that clearly doesn't know the value of devices. They have no empathy either, I came a long way to this outlet just for that phone. If I am buying a used device or selling a device, I have to give my opinions and reasoning. If it makes sense then you have to do something to please the customer.
In an overview, You lost a potential lifelong customer. Only come here if you want to either be disappointed or repair your phone. Thanks for taking time to read my review. Phone to trade in - Find X8, Phone I wanted to get - Honor Magic 7 Pro.",2025-08-20T09:45:51.566Z,retail

Mister Mobile (Woodlands),5,"Hello...I went to your Woodlands Branch twice, that is 27/7 and 9/8. Both were for purchase of new mobile. The first visit we were lucky that the model that my son was interested in was available. Mr Marcus Ang served us. He has good customer service. He is very polite and patience. I wanted to pay by vouchers and cash so Mr Marcus explained how the system works. The first transaction went smoothly and my son is happy with his new mobile. My second visit was after I made several enquiries through your whatsapp number. I enquired about the availability of particular model and color available . Your whatsapp Admin told me it was only available at your Tampines outlet. I did not gave up and asked 'Can transfer it to your Woodlands branch? I live at Woodlands'. I did not wait long and I received whatapp confirming my reservations. It was on National Day a PH but they were willing to go to the extend for their customer. Good Job👍. Late afternoon went to Woodlands branch to make my purchase and was served by Mr Marcus Ang again. Purchased transaction settled fast as they had my record. Mister Mobile...please recognise good efforts put forward by your staff like Mr Marcus Ang. His personal touch will make a lot of difference to your organisation.

Mister Mobile (Bukit Panjang),2,"I got my S22 ultra screen replaced with Mister Mobile at Bukit Panjang earlier in January this year as I dropped it. Repair went well and paid $278 and I was told to avoid water contact as it is no longer IP68 rated which is fair advice given.
About 7 months later, the screen started glitching, colors were washed out and phone cannot be set to 120hz refresh rate or it would glitch crazily which I needed to use screen mirroring to reset to 60hz. Brought it down to the same branch to understand why a Grade A screen would fail after less than a year. Tried to show the staff the issue I'm facing and one glance he says it'll cost $268 to fix without examining the phone.
I said I got this replaced here and wanted to know why is it glitching so badly. The response was all Samsung phones are known to have this issue and screens are known to fail after awhile. I wish they had given a disclaimer when they replaced my screen in January to anticipate a failure down the road in a year's time, maybe I would have just put that money into a new phone. Before I dropped my phone, original screen was fine and had no green lines or glitches.
By then I've heard enough, thanked him and walked away dissapointed. I guess I'm posting here just as a heads up to people looking to replace their Samsung LCD screens not to expect too much longevity, I've got seven months out of it, maybe you could do better than me.",2025-08-23T14:31:32.685Z,retail

"Love, Bonito ION Orchard - Women's Fashion & Clothing",5,"Horrible ! I’m a foreign customer and purchased 11 pieces of outfits from Ion branch and only to find one of the skirt they gave me was wrong after I returned to my country . There is no phone number that I can contact and I’m so disappointed that I didn’t get the skirt that I loved instead I was given a dress that look very similar except that it has 2 strings to tie on shoulder as a dress . Same color same design but it was not my skirt ! Why do they give you a new piece in plastic bag at the counter when paying but not open to show customer . I know we are supposed to check but the dress and skirt looked very similar in the plastic bag you wouldn’t have thought to open and check . Totally disappointed!!

This is an update of the disappointment I had as I described above . With a suggestion from a friend I managed to contact love bonito on email . The customer service was really helpful and quick in their responses . After 30 emails back and froth, I managed to changed my skirt at another outlet at my convenience . I do appreciate their efforts and I bought another 2 psc from them . I will still continue to buy from them .",2025-08-21T11:49:42.897Z,retail

I would like to share my recent experience at your Joon Koon outlet. The service at the workshop was very slow, with only one staff member attending to many customers. This led to long queues and a lot of waiting time.

It seems that the store is understaffed, especially during weekends when there are many customers with issues such as bike or badminton racket servicing. The slow service caused quite a frustrating experience for me, and I believe for other customers as well.

I hope Decathlon can improve the staffing and service speed at the Joon Koon workshop to provide a smoother experience for customers.",2025-08-23T09:35:58.492Z,retail

Aces Mobile,2,"I just got my Z Flip 5 flex cable repaired. Service was pretty good, they were fast and responsive, and upfront about potential issues.

The repair quality is a bit suspect though - the phone exterior wasn't in great condition to begin with, but it's much worse now. 😅 Lots of glue protruding from different parts, and some scrapes and chipping where it was pried apart. When I open it there's also a slight creasing sound and the closing doesn't look quite right. I still got charged full price for the repair.

But the cable has been fixed and it works! They provide only a 30-day warranty for this, compared to the 90-day for their other repairs, so I will see how long this lasts.

Edit: Dropped a star because their response is quite disingenuous. The screen was damaged prior, but the exterior was totally fine -- and from the photos you can see now that it's quite a mess. That was their doing.

A month on and the phone is holding up all right, but the hinge is a bit wobbly and probably will not last long. Overall I'd say that it's an expensive and low-quality fix.",2025-04-24T12:35:44.137Z,retail

Aces Mobile insist I provide my PIN for repair and kept making comments that I slowed them down by not providing the PIN.

found ourselves at Von's for happy hour.

This was my first time at Von's (a legendary Seattle institution that opened in 1974) but it won't be my last.  

We snagged a table on the back patio, and ordered the burger, fries, and pita & hummus - all to be shared.

I thought the burger was good, but the fries were great.  I don't waste my time on frozen French fries, and these hand- cut babies are the real thing!  

Hummus also delicious - and interesting choice to see a flat bread type pita in lieu of traditional pita.  

Service was attentive.",8/6/2025,Food & Beverage

Also stole a fry which was extremely good similar to wing stop quality which I love. Perfect side salad for health!

This place is always packed so be patient and expect a wait but it's well worth it!

Von's 1000 Spirits,5,"Von's 1000 Spirits is a gastropub in downtown Seattle that serves 1000 different spirits and a delicious burger. If you're looking for some late night eats, this may be the best place to visit. Not only can you get your drink on, but you can also grab some delicious food.

My Overall Rating - 5 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)

Atmosphere - The front of Von's is a long bar. Lots of standing with few chairs. Tons of people on my Monday night visit. You'll have to walk through the narrow bar to get to the dining room where you'll find plenty of seats and tables. I noticed with there's tons of energy (and noise) from the people looking to have a drink and good bite to eat. 1 Star.

Service - There was no wait for a table at 5:30 on a Monday. The dining room wasn't full when I arrived; however, it was packed by the time we left. Our server was very attentive and gave several great recommendations from the menu. He checked in a few times and even checked this out right at the table. 1 Star.

Food - I started with the Pork Confit Fries.  WOW.  The tender braised pork sat on a bed of seasoned fries while a generous portion of cheese blanketed both. When I took a bite that included all three - It was simply delicious.  Salty. Tender. Cheesy. Delicious. For my main dish, I had the Double Smashed American Burger.  It tasted like a Double Double from In-n-Out except with caramelized onions and more beef. In other words, it was better than I could even imagine. Each bite led to a beautiful juicy mess. Perfection. 2 Stars.

Will I Return? - Yes.  My hotel concierge recommended that I try Von's for their burger (and they're open until 2 AM). At first I was skeptical; however, I'm glad I went because it turned out I had one of the best meals in Seattle here.  1 Star.",15/3/2025,Food & Beverage
Von's 1000 Spirits,5,"Creative menu and cool atmosphere.  We have been here three times and each time we are impressed. Great sourdough pasta and pizza.  Sourdough history in Seattle goes back to at least the late 1800's, and these guys keep the heritage alive.",4/8/2025,Food & Beverage
Von's 1000 Spirits,4,"Stopped by on a Saturday afternoon around 3:30, only 10 minute wait for 2, but it was crowded and by the time we left there were several groups waiting and in line.

Ambience was great. Very warm, inviting, and smelled delicious. Special shoutout to our server Alyce who was wonderful.

We ordered the pork confit fries to start and they were DELICIOUS!! Surprisingly the best dish we got.

For the mains we ordered the 4-meat pizza, and salmon pasta. The pizza was tasty, but also very greasy which in turn made it soggy and difficult to eat. If you were to pick up a slice with one hand it'd flop down and all the toppings would fall off so you have to kinda balance it. But it def hit the spot regardless. Salmon pasta was refreshing and tangy and provided a nice compliment to the pizza. Neither dish was otherworldly.

Overall, good quality and tasty food, great service, worth visiting.",16/8/2025,Food & Beverage
Von's 1000 Spirits,4,"Wanting a unique meal at a new spot, Von's 1000 Spirits lured us in with their emphasis on sourdough. Being two Bay Area girls, we're more than familiar with sourdough--so we were excited!

The restaurant is super casual with a relaxed atmosphere. There is a long bar with a variety of spirits, hence the name. Plenty of tables inside to sip and dine, plus outdoor dining is available. It's a popular spot being close to Pike Place and near the water. I found the service to be a bit stiff and with a bit of a cold shoulder. 

Sourdough is the bread and butter of this restaurant, you can see it being made at the front. You can find sourdough pasta, pizzas, sandwiches, and so many more local offerings. I knew I had to try their Basil Almond Pesto Sourdough Pasta, which I got without Chèvre Cheese and added Hot Fennel Sausage. The amount of pasta was generous but I felt there wasn't as much sausage. The pasta itself was delicious--the perfect chew, coated the sauce nicely, and the tomatoes provided a burst of color and flavor. My best friend had the Tellicherry Chicken and Gouda and enjoyed it!

Von's 1000 Spirits,4,"Went with a friend for happy hour. There was a long line at about 5:50pm, but ended up snagging 2 seats at the bar. Lots of seats at the bar and it's first come first serve.

I got Von's Von's Cacio e Pepe Pizza and Crispy Bang Bang Chicken. These are a must order!!! The pizza was so saucy, savory, and sweet at the same time and I love the crunch of the crust. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the sauce is sweet and spicy.

The bar is a little tight, so people kept bumping into us or would stand behind their friends leaving little space.

I want to try the woodinville location now!!",17/7/2025,Food & Beverage
Von's 1000 Spirits,5,"Absolutely our favorite meal in Seattle! We ordered 3 different pastas, 1 pizza, and two mocktails and loved everything. Olga was fantastic. This is definitely a place we would return to if we are ever back in the area.",24/8/2025,Food & Beverage

Von's 1000 Spirits,2,"We dined at Von's 1000 Spirits for the first time on Friday, May 30th at about 6:30PM with our party of three.

It was a busy and louder spot; however, we were excited considering the great reviews.  We had about a 30 minute wait, which was not bad considering it was a busy Friday evening.

I'm not sure if I want to give this place another chance or not.  I will admit that the food was pretty good.  I had the Cuban sandwich, and it was delicious.  I also had a champagne mango margarita, which was also very good.

However, our visit was absolutely destroyed by the service provided by our server.  She made it very clear many times verbally, that she did not want to be working this evening.  Her attitude showed that as well.

The first odd thing is that she came by with water less than a minute after we sat down and she profusely apologized for the excessive long wait, which we found really odd.  Then that is the first time she went into the fact that they called her in, because someone else called out this evening and she is ""out of it"" and ""tired"" and ""didn't want to be working"".   She just kept telling us this over and over and over.  We didn't need to know any of this.

One of the people in our party ordered the Basil Almond Pesto and added the ""Fennel Sausage"".  Later when it came out, it didn't have any sausage in it.  We inquired with her, and told her that there was no need for it; however, we wanted to make sure it wasn't on the bill.   She suddenly went into a whole rant about ""Are you mad at me now?"".  ""I don't want you to be mad at me"".   ""Are you sure you aren't mad at me?"".  It was just too much.

We were then presented with the Toast thing to pay our bill.  I asked for a printed copy of the receipt, because I couldn't see the detail on the bill (I don't believe we were charged properly).  She said, that she would have to get her manager for a copy of the receipt, because I wanted to see it before I left instead of emailing it to myself.  She left and never returned, even waiting 10 minutes before leaving the table after paying.  

This was just a terribly odd experience.",31/5/2025,Food & Beverage
Von's 1000 Spirits,5,"Were visiting in downtown Seattle & went to my friend's favorite restaurant ~Von's~.
Our server, David, was fabulous. We had a gorgeous outside balcony table.  We ordered salmon pasta, avocado, steak sandwich & bacon cheeseburger with Caesar salads ... 
OMGGGGGG ~ THE BEST ‼

you want me disappointed ‼",16/6/2025,Food & Beverage
Von's 1000 Spirits,1,"We visited as a party of four. When it came time to pay, our server asked if we wanted one bill or to split the check. We chose to split. The server brought over a handheld Toast point-of-sale machine, took each of our cards, and immediately presented the tip screen (with 18%, 20%, and 22% pre-calculated options) before showing us an itemized bill.

I tipped 20% and then asked for a printed receipt. That's when I noticed a separate line item called ""Cook Commission - 5%"" added to the pre-tip total. This meant my actual tip ended up being 25% -- but I had no idea at the time because I wasn't shown the bill beforehand.

At every other restaurant I've been to, you're shown an itemized check first so you know the exact charges before deciding on a tip. Here, we were essentially tipping ""blind"" without being told about the extra 5% charge.

I find this practice non-transparent and, in my opinion, unethical. I hope the management reconsiders how they present bills so guests can make informed tipping decisions.",11/8/2025,Food & Beverage
Von's 1000 Spirits,3,"We arrived without a reservation for dinner and waited at the bar. The bar service was incredibly rude, which was a disappointing start. However, once we were seated, our waitress was wonderful--attentive and friendly. It was my birthday, and she even surprised us with a lovely dessert and candles! The food itself was delicious, rich, and flavorful. The restaurant has a nice ambiance; the bar area is a bit lively, while the dining room is cozy and inviting.",27/5/2025,Food & Beverage
Von's 1000 Spirits,5,"The place was busy for a Friday night, there were groups of people already waiting in the entrance. We waited in the bar for our table to be ready. We waited about 15-20 minutes. Not long at all. 

We were sat in the back near the windows that over looked the next block of businesses and a courtyard. 

We order the Cesar salad and the whole milk burrata and sourdough bread first. One of the best Cesar salads I've had. I could finish the plate to myself. The burrata was creamy, it was paired with a pesto sauce. The sourdough bread was soft and fluffy. A nice vessel to hold the burrata and pesto. 

I ordered the chicken Parmesan sandwich, something I wouldn't normally order. It came with a marinara sauce to dip. Ah-mazing flavors. The fries were fried to perfection. The chicken sandwich itself was phenomenal. The bread is soft and crunchy. The chicken is juicy and crispy. It had a sort of pesto chimichurri  sauce in it. The mozzarella cheese was perfectly salty. Dipped into the marinara sauce, it complimented the sandwich. A different spin to the chicken Parmesan with pasta. My boyfriend ordered the burger with onion jam. Very juicy, the onions caramelized well. One of the best burgers we have had. The first was in Denver. 

We would definitely come back to try more dishes!",9/2/2025,Food & Beverage

Colony,3,"Very average dining experience. Not much explanation was given - it's all buffet style with water/tea/coffee served by the waiter(esses). For 48 SGD I almost expected a bit more. The choices are between pancakes, omelette bar, dim sum, chirashi bites, eggs benedict, an assortment of small breads, salad bar, fruits and juices, and a few curries. Not one of my most favorite ritz breakfast experiences, but it works if you don't want to leave the hotel.",13/4/2022,Food & Beverage
Colony,5,"This buffet was worth every dollar spent!

My wife and I celebrated our 1 year anniversary (and part of our honeymoon) at Colony and it was everything I read about it and more. Buffets are typically unattractive gorge-fest atmospheres filled with gluttony and sloppiness everywhere, but Colony puts a whole new spin on it. The restaurant puts other buffets to shame, adding a major touch of classiness and romanticism to it all.

The restaurant is located in the Ritz-Carlton hotel and can easily be found in the lobby. Customers are first greeted by the Patisserie section, with its delectable collection of pastries and desserts, before making their way onto the dining area. After a quick glance, one might even want to skip straight to dessert -- that is, until they lay their eyes on one of the other 6 sections of the buffet.

Besides the Patisserie, there's the following sections, which are all connected to one another:

ICE BAR - Jumbo shrimp cocktail, snow crab legs, raw oysters, mussels, craw fish, sashimi, sushi, etc.
GRILL & ROTISSERIE - Grilled ham, brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes, sausage, squash, kale, etc.
STEAM BASKET - Steamed dim sum, buns, ready to made hot pot food, fish balls, noodles, etc.
WOK - Chinese/Malay cuisine, such as, steamed fish, chili crab, fried rice, prawns, ribs, vermicelli, etc.
TANDOOR - Indian cuisine, such as, various curries, basmati rice, etc.
FRUIT STALL - Juices and whole fruits

I probably did not come close to naming every single food that was served in each section, but it should give any hungry person an idea prior to walking in. I can't fit a comment here on every single item, but to summarize, the seafood was extremely fresh, the sushi was great for a buffet, the hot foods from the Chinese/Malay/Indian cuisine sections were very tasty. We didn't find a single thing wrong with anything we ate. By far the most attractive section though was the Patisserie. The assortment of pastries and little desserts here and there were fantastic and any dessert lover's dream. It really gave us the opportunity to sample away because they were small enough.

Yes, the buffet is $88 per adult for dinners .. and it's totally worth it with the amazing selection and chill atmosphere. Buffets aren't typically thought of as date restaurants, but Colony really redefines what a buffet is. On top of it all, our waiter was excellent. He knew we were here for our honeymoon and even gave us a quick tour of the buffet when we arrived so we wouldn't get lost. The perfect buffet? If it's not, it's damn close to it.",22/12/2018,Food & Beverage
Colony,5,"My favorite champagne brunch spot in Singapore! It use to be called the Greenhouse. The same space was renamed Colony, but the all you can drink and eat decadent buffet is pretty much the same.

As expected of a champagne brunch in Singapore, it has a full raw bar, plenty of charcuterie, a nice cheese selections, some dim sum,  pasta and noodle stations, a roast of some sort, breakfast items, soups, salad bar, and a variety of desserts. You can eat for days, but you only have a few hours to gobble down all this goodness, nevermind the free flow vintaged brut or rose champagne and Bloody Marys.

Champagne brunch in Singapore is not a meal, it's an event, so bring an empty stomach and some great friends and prepare to have an amazing time getting stuffed on food and drink!",20/12/2018,Food & Beverage
Colony,5,One of my favorite places to bring my friends and family when we want buffet. Excellent fresh food and stellar service.

Colony,4,"It's a promising buffet, but like buffets food in general is good, but never excellent. They do offer a good variety of food. Noodle stand, dim sum, Chinese bbq, pizza, burgers, cheese table, sushi, seafood (king crab legs, shrimp, oyster) big dessert area with different chocolates, ice cream and cake. Even nitro infused dessert made on the spot. Last thing a juice bar. It was a bit pricey, but with the selection it's fair. Dining area is good size and service was attentive.",30/4/2019,Food & Beverage
Colony,5,"I absolutely loved this buffet.

I came here for everyday for breakfast and lunch. I'd say the lunch is more spectacular than the breakfast spread.

They have sushi, Singapore food, juices, meats/cheeses, Chinese food, Indian food, a whole bread station, and a beautiful dessert section. Lunch is special because you can get crab legs.",4/3/2019,Food & Beverage
Colony,5,"Absolutely loved dining at Colony! I was warmly greeted and shown to my table, and on the way set my eyes on the beautiful buffet. The restaurant itself is tastefully designed and the lay out of the buffet flows nicely. The selection is wonderful and clearly makes sure to incorporate local dishes. Naturally, I sampled as much as I could and was pleasantly surprised to have found everything to be delicious-from experience often not the case in buffet style dining. The steamed salted egg bun, specifically, was phenomenal and is a must try. 
Every individual I encountered working at Colony was exceedingly friendly, and one of the chefs even posed the steamer baskets so that I could take a nice photo with the salted egg buns. I'll be visiting again on my next trip to Singapore!",20/3/2020,Food & Beverage
Colony,4,"The crowd, as expected in a hotel, is all tourists. Sometimes gems can be discovered in unexpected places. Despite the aging Ritz Carlton starting to appear more like an average Marriott than a Ritz, The Colony restaurant inside was a treat both in design and quality.

Stepping into this uniquely designed space, there is a sense of surprise and confusion. The confusion arises from the vastly dispersed food selections throughout, making the breakfast appear endless. The dividers, decorated with antiques and imagery of Singapore provide a museum like feel to what would otherwise be a buffet. Selections are very vast, making it difficult to make a decision. Every piece of the meal was amazing, with the exception of one dish, the chicken curry in the Malay section which was not prepared well and the chicken very dry.

The service was spectacular and the buffet selections even beat out The St Regis where we spent the last evening in Singapore. Sitting next to the bamboo garden here is very relaxing and the building provides a fair share of natural light. 

So, don't get discouraged by the otherwise sad looking architecture of this building and the cramped, boring entrance into the property, this restaurant is a must for luxurious breakfast.",27/9/2018,Food & Beverage
Colony,5,"The Colony is hands down in my Top 3 of best buffets in Singapore.  

We enjoyed It, The seafood spread is insane, lobsters, oysters, prawns, everything! The dessert room feels like being that kid on Christmas morning, Just excited to try out everything.

Colony,5,"The free breakfast here is over the top and most excellent. We stayed at the Ritz Carlton and enjoyed the buffet breakfast (included in our room rate) here every morning. Superb, intuitive service all around.

That breakfast is probably the very best of all that we ever enjoyed. So many stations, nearly everything cooked to order, from dim sum, Malay and Filipino cuisine to Indonesian and all the Western dishes one could possibly imagine. We were so full every day that we skipped lunch.

Love that congee / noodle staiton.",28/12/2024,Food & Beverage
Colony,3,"Colony is located within the Ritz Carlton, a greenish looking building around Suntec. The lay out is nice and the service was excellent. Most of the food was nicely made and presented, which is what you'd expect from a fancy $$$$ buffet. 

That said, the selections seemed rather limited, the layout of the food stations a bit confusing, and the overall value just didn't seem to be there. 

10% gratuity is automatically charged to your bill.",23/10/2024,Food & Beverage
Colony,4,"The Colony Buffet is located in the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Singapore.  I have been into the hotel lobby once and it always seem that they frown upon people who are not participating in the hotel activities.  Even though I was 15 minutes eraly for my reservation, I was questioned for the reason I was in the hotel.  I have been to other RItz Carltons before and I never felt like this before.  Anyway, we entered the restaurant and was immediate seated at our table.  From an overall standpoint, I feel that the buffet is quite small.  The seafood section seemed lacking.  There was barely a carving station and the freshly made rojak was way too sweet that is was almost inedible.  The quality and taste of many of the other dishes were very good and tasty.  There was a hidden option where you can ask for scallops on the half shell at the seafood section.  I guess they had a limited number and did not want everyone to just focus on that one item.  Service was mostly OK but I was disappointed when it took close to 15 minutes and two waiters to get the check for me to pay.  For a RItz Carlton, they need to do better.",10/5/2025,Food & Beverage
Colony,5,"Nestled within the embrace of The Ritz-Carlton, Colony gracefully unfolds as an epicurean tapestry, weaving a symphony of flavors that tantalize the palate and captivate the senses.  Having garnered rave reviews, securing a reservation here akin to snagging a wishbone during the first bite of a Christmas turkey, bordered on the miraculous.  My last-minute serendipity, however, paved the way for an experience as extraordinary as the tales whispered of old.

The buffet itself was a symphony of culinary delights.  Glistening seafood, nestled on beds of crushed ice, beckoned with their briny allure, while a kaleidoscope of colorful salads promised an explosion of flavors.  Plump, jewel-toned cheeses and charcuterie slices of unparalleled finesse awaited alongside steaming baskets of dim sum.  For the more adventurous palates, aromatic curries whispered of faraway lands, their spice-laden warmth transporting diners to vibrant Indian bazaars.  Those seeking comfort found solace in bowls of freshly prepared pasta, each strand a canvas for vibrant sauces that sang with Italianate passion.  A noodle station offered comforting bowls of laksa, the rich coconut broth laced with the fragrant whisper of lemongrass, and steaming bowls of pho, the translucent rice noodles cradling slivers of succulent beef.

And then, there was dessert. A veritable fantasia of sugary delights, it was a playground for the inner child.  Tarts, glistening like jewels, held secrets of citrus and cream.  Chocolate pralines, each a decadent bite, whispered promises of pure, unadulterated bliss.  Waffles, crisp and golden, awaited their baptism in a molten river of maple syrup, while onde-onde, those little orbs of chewy rice cake, offered a delightful textural contrast.  Cookies, macarons, pandan cake, and a kaleidoscope of other confections transformed the dessert station into a Willy Wonka wonderland for grown-ups.  Each bite was a tiny explosion of flavor, a testament to the pastry chef's artistry.

Of course, no experience is flawless.  The tandoori turkey, while flavorful, did veer towards the drier side, a minor misstep in an otherwise flawless performance.  The dessert selection, while impressive, could have boasted a wider variety, as could the hot and seafood items.  But these were mere whispers of discontent, quickly drowned out by the resounding chorus of delight that played on my palate.

At 88 SGD, or roughly $68 USD, the buffet is an investment.  Add taxes and the ever-present nudge of gratuity, and you're looking at a cool 105 SGD, or $79 USD.  But for an experience that transcends mere sustenance, that elevates the act of eating to an art form, Colony is worth every penny.

And as for the Ritz-Carlton itself, well, let's just say that its understated elegance might not quite live up to the opulent standards of its younger, flashier counterparts.  Think of it as a comfortable old shoe, well-worn but undeniably reliable, rather than a pair of sky-high stilettos that might leave you with blisters at the end of the night.

In the end, Colony's buffet may not be the undisputed champion of Singapore's smorgasbord scene.  That crown, for now, rests on the shimmering head of Rise at Marina Bay Sands.  But for a delightful, meticulously crafted, and utterly satisfying culinary journey, Colony stands tall, a testament to the fact that sometimes, the most exquisite experiences are found not in the grandest settings, but in the quiet corners, where passion and artistry weave their magic on a plate.",1/1/2024,Food & Beverage
Colony,5,This buffet is an absolute must do experience in Singapore! Not only does it highlight Singaporean cuisine it does a great job with its Western offerings as well. Of two particular things to note are the beautiful decorated atmosphere and the staff.

Colony,5,"Colony is one the restaurants inside Ritz. They offer buffet lunch/dinner and afternoon tea. I was looking for a place for afternoon tea when we were visiting Singapore. After I saw their menu, this is the one. I made a reservation online and it was easy. 
The ""journey"" set included a glass of champagne or cocktail, 6 different savory goodies, unlimited sweets and your choice of tea. The savory items were all very tasty with local twist. They came in good size (not in petite). Our belly were happy and so full. The staff were friendly and the manager also checked on us a couple times. I noticed that they offer limited edition afternoon tea for the season or holiday (lunar new year). Highly recommended!",29/4/2023,Food & Beverage
Colony,5,"This is , supposedly, the number one buffet in Singapore right now.  It is located inside the Ritz Carlton.  I think it came out to about $70~$80 US Dollars.  Make a reservation online in order to get in (do in advance by a few weeks).

Seating and Dining Area was beautiful.  Definitely a bit more luxurious looking inside than that of any Vegas buffet. 

There are a few stations.  I believe there is a staggered rush, but only turn the tables over only once maybe.  The seafood area is the closest and is in the center of the dining area.  There are delicious and huge fresh prawns, crawfish, clams, mussels, some small snow crab claws, and some super tasty oysters from Japan.  There's then a sushi area that has some pretty tasty salmon sashimi and a few other assorted sushis.  This gets super packed with people wanting to try the seafood first. 

Then there's a ""u-shaped"" back area behind the seafood that has a ""roasted meats stall"" that is very decorative, as they have a display case and everything.  There's also a pasta station - which makes a pretty good seafood miso carbonara (pretty uniquely tasty).  The western area isn't very good imho.  The indian station is decent, and someone is making fresh naans.  The singaporean/asian area was good -- they have chili crab, which is made with soft shell crab.  The noodle station was good , with plenty of tasty prawns in it. The guy working was also super nice. Then there's a dim sum area.

Drink wise, there are some juices (nothing special, coming out of a box and poured into the cups), along with some desserts.   There's a dessert station near the front which had a lot of good stuff from local kuey to macaroons. 

Give it a try if you're in SG.  A good variety of stuff , high quality, and has a good balance of SG classics and non Singaporean stuff.",22/1/2023,Food & Beverage

Colony,2,"I used to like to go to Ritz Carlton's Colony restaurant for its buffet. We went to colony this Monday. The restaurant was not full house though. However we were given a make shift squeezed table of Five by a service staff Nina. At first she refused to change table for us, saying that the table is ok with 5 people and the restaurant was fully booked. We told her to call for the manager,then she agree to change to another proper table for 5 persons.                                                                     The food in the Colony is getting very boring with declining quality. The Japanese counter sashimi and sushi are the standard offerings with no creativity. The color and presentation of food were not attractive. The worst is at the Chinese counter. The dim sum was terrible with no quality control. The texture of dim sum was either rubbery and the Sui Mai texture was soft and starchy with no prawn and meat texture. The Laksa noodles gravy does not taste like Laksa at all. The gravy was over cooked with a burnt taste.                                      The dessert counter was boring and there were no outstanding desserts at all. Just average quality with variety. I was not even tempted to take any dessert when I pass by the dessert counter.                                                           
Service was excellent apart from the Host blunder in table assignment.                                                       I realized nowadays 6stars hotel like Ritz Carlton, Fullerton, due to their reputation and good business , have ignored their initial brand promise to customers. They are sitting on their laurels because the numbers are good and get carried away with food quality and presentation of food. No use of providing wide variety of food, if as a six star hotel restaurants is unable to deliver a 6star professional attitude towards its operations in quality, presentation and innovation of the food offerings to your customers! I realized the so called 6 star hotel restaurants in Singapore cannot be compared with those in Thailand and Hong Kong! The owners of 6 star hotels needs to shake up the hotel management staff and constantly keep them in checked to deliver the brand promise and commitment to their customers !",17/1/2019,Food & Beverage

Colony,4,"This is a review for a Sunday buffet brunch at Colony restaurant, main level of the Ritz Carlton. Formerly branded as the Greenhouse, the Ritz has put much thought and effort into reorganizing the buffet areas into a more consolidated and efficient operation. They've also changed the feel of the dining room by adding partition walls that display framed stock photos all with the theme: colonization.

The effect of the heavily used partition wall modules is that of a Pottery Barn store. The feel is that all of the framed photos are on display to sell. The only thing missing are the price tags. The Wall Modules break up the large space creating a more intimate dining experience. What is lost is the joy of people watching during the brunch. With the serving stations all moved to a remote (mostly hidden) location at the rear of the restaurant and the partition walls segmenting the space into smaller dining areas, the feel is not as good as the Greenhouse. 

The wide spectrum of food offerings are enough to please any palette. Local, Indian, Western, Seafood, Cheese, Breads, Desserts, etc. In addition to the free flow champagne, bartenders are on duty to make Bloody Marys and Espresso Martinis. I had several of each and both were delicious.

The staff is friendly, well trained and attentive. Champagne glasses were always kept full, empty plates continually cleared, and Bloody Marys and Martinis delivered upon request. 

The Good: Food Quality, Staff, Ambiance

The Bad: I'm not a fan of the maze-like new partition wall modules that detract from the grand architectural space and prefer the more open and spacious feel of the Greenhouse. Hands down, the Greenhouse was a much better brunch experience.

The Verdict: Colony is a prime player in the Singapore Sunday Brunch scene. Glad to have visited, but I think I'll wait for the bi-annual ""Super Brunch"" before returning.",2/6/2016,Food & Beverage

Paulaner Bräuhaus Singapore,4,"Working through a tumultuous week can result in voracious appetites for freedom and stacks, and stacks of food by the time the weekend rolls in. If this is what you're feeling on a Sunday morning, Paulaner Brauhaus fits your demands to a T.

Step in and be amazed at their triple storey restaurant that includes a bar and a brewery and an outdoors corner for those who like to bask in the sun on Sundays... but patrons flock here by the dozens for their fill of authentic Bavarian food fare.

When one thinks of German food, bratwursts and pickles come to mind. You won't find many pickles, but sausages, you will find, in plain bounty. Meet the juiciest sausages you'll have the greatest pleasure of eating, the Thüringer, (Cheese, and without), Debreziener, and Nürnberger. Slap on some authentic German mustard made with freshy ground mustard seed to balance the savouriness with some zest, or drench your bratwurst in curry sauce, and enjoy.

Don't get too full on the sausages though. There's always room for their crispy pork knuckles. As big as two of your fists put together, this culinary delight is sure to send your taste buds into overdrive. Sink your teeth into the tenderness of the knuckles and be delighted by the unexpected juiciness that squirts out of the flesh.

The kitchen is glacially slow.  The servers will bring you your food, then disappear without ever giving you the fork you may want to use to eat it with.  Want mustard with your pretzel?  You'll have to go up to the bar later and ask for some.  How many times do you have to ask for plates?  

I feel quite hopeful that they'll get their act together, but for now, bring your patience when you visit... and as long as you have a good sense of humor about it, you'll almost certainly still have a good time.    Staff is friendly (if confused) and food is tasty (if slow).",19/4/2017,Food & Beverage

Paulaner has two levels, with bar downstairs and full restaurant and another outdoor bar upstairs. The upstairs area is a lot more tame and so we spent all of our time atop bar stools in front of the huge bar.  Beers were quite good, especially the Weissbier, and the bartenders all seemed to be having a blast, making the atmosphere a lot of fun.

Food is hearty and usually comes is large portions, ordered their German twist on pizza one time bcos the sausages were just too much meat without starch and it turned out to be this large and rich concoction which was tasty but me & wife had a tough time finishing it...

They also have a band doing their gig on the beer making apparatus which is nice nothing particularly great overall nice buzzy noisy place until unless you want to sit outside which is little tightly packed or upstairs which is usually  a little too quiet.",15/9/2013,Food & Beverage
Paulaner Bräuhaus Singapore,4,"Great place with live music and nice ambience. My friend ordered pork knuckle with bread dumpling and I had codfish with vegetables. Both tasted good. I especially like the bread dumpling. The pork knuckle had a few parts which were rather hard so maybe you can indicate that you do not want it to be too roasted. The codfish is small but the side dishes make it filling. If baked potato is not your kind of thing, perhaps ask for two servings of the fresh Brussels sprouts, broccoli and carrots with almond flakes instead. Portion is quite big so three people might want to order two dishes and share unless you are super hungry.",9/7/2016,Food & Beverage

If you can drink a lot would be interested to pay a single amount of bill for it, this is the place. The servers will keep on topping your beer up once they see one's glass is empty.

Paulaner Bräuhaus Singapore,4,"Located at Millenia Walk, this microbrewery serves up consistently good beer and is an ideal place to chill out at night. If you're looking for a little conversation, sit outside as the inside can get quite noisy when the bands start to play.

I'm usually good with a pint (0.5l) of the draught pale lager, which is light and goes down easy. If you're feeling a little full, they have them in 0.3l mugs as well (which are so cute!) or if you're thirsty, go for the 1l! The dunkel/dark version is quite good as well if you like it a little stronger tasting.

For bar snacks, go for the german sausages, and they do a pretty good calamari too.

The food was rather meh. There was nothing spectacular or horrendous about it. We shared the sampler platter. It was hard to tell what each item was and even the waitress seemed confused. 

The pretzel tastes like the kind you buy in the freezer section and reheat in a microwave. Don't waste your money on that.

Due to our short visit, we only got drinks, but I did see a good amount of people with food, although it seems like from the other reviews on here, that was the establishment's downfall.

- PARKING -
I believe there was a mall parking structure nearby, but we took ride shares that dropped us off right in front of the restaurant.

- SERVICE/ENVIRONMENT -
We got seated immediately, and in the beginning the staff was very attentive. However this definitely dropped off towards the end, when we were trying to order an additional drink and also when trying to get the check to leave.

- DRINKS -
Lycheetini ($18.00): Exactly what it sounds like. I'm not a huge alcoholic drinker, so the fact this wasn't overpowering straight up liquor was a good thing for me. Nice taste of Lychee but not juice either!

The Hugo ($17.00): This was a hit for our group - everyone enjoyed sips of this and was the drink that we tried to order more of! Really nice balance of flavors!

A friend also got the Beer Liter and well, it's definitely a lot of beer so if you're up to it, it's doable!

Our occasion was an extended work luncheon where we got to sample most of the beer and menu offerings. 
Even considering there was not a German person or a polka band onsite, you might imagine yourself in a German beer hall if you could forget you're actually in a mall in sweltering Singapore.
The most shocking offering was the boiled pork knuckle. Although a fairly popular dish in Singapore, the boiled version is not for the faint of heart. Everything else was decently made and served.

Paulaner Bräuhaus Singapore,5,"An old secondary school friend recently suggested this popular German microbrewery bar for our quarterly meet-up; which includes lots of girl-talk, tooth-achingly sweet desserts and most importantly, rich and creamy golden goodness in the form of beer. 

Patrons can opt for private high-stool booths indoors as well as an alfresco style balcony on the second level. There was plenty of room for a gathering of friends, and also a romantic back-drop complete with the Singapore Flyer for couples on a date. 

I would personally suggest getting a seat early in the evening before the night crowd swarms, and getting their signature Munich lager straight away to take advantage of their 1-for-1 beers between 12 to 8pm. Their fried Pork Knuckles was a heart-attack-sized platter of melt in your mouth meat, with a side of buttery German mashed potato. Don't forget their specialty of grilled sausages - the best way to try them all would be the Paulaner Sausage Pan, which features 5 of their top picks in a single platter. Finish it off with Caramelized Bavarian Emperor's Pancake, with warm fluffy chunks of buttered batter coated in crispy sugar, served with caramelized apple sauce; every sugar-high-junkie's dream! 

Being stuffed as we were, it's best to get the chit chat out of the way by 9 and enjoy as their live band gets on stage to croon their way through jazzy and country numbers, with a song request segment after each set.  A cheeky request of the popular radio anthem 'We Are Young' was gamely attempted by the guitar-strumming uncles, to much applause and appreciative sing-along, making it the perfect rowdy end to a cozy night out.",3/8/2012,Food & Beverage

Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,"If you want to score, this is the place to bring your wife or girlfriend! Salt Grill oozes with sex appeal. You enter the restaurant through a welcome area on the 4th floor of ION and through a special elevator bank behind the art gallery. Once you reach the top floor, you are greeted by a beautiful dining space and jaw dropping views of Singapore.

Making a reservation is a must, especially if you want to secure a spot with one of the limited tables that line glass viewing area.

Our order included: raw oysters, glass Sydney crab omelette, rocket salad, and bone-in ribeye steak for two. The glass Sydney Crab Omelette was a definite winner and is a must have appetizer. The Rocket Salad with blue cheese, pear and candied walnuts is a great choice for anyone in the mood for a refreshing salad.

The clear highlight for me was without question the Bone-in Rib Eye. The steak was juicy, perfectly cooked, and mouth watering. However, I'm a fanatic of steaks that are juicy on the inside and crisp on the outside (Heston Blumenthal way of cooking steak). Don't get me wrong, Salt grill delivers a damn good steak, but I can't give it the ""best in Singapore"" designation. The restaurant was also nice enough to alter my sides from mash potatoes to roasted garlic mushrooms, free of charge.

Overall, Salt is a wonderful restaurant and is among the very best in Singapore. 5 stars for the ambience and breathtaking views and 4 stars for the food.",11/10/2014,Food & Beverage
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,5,"Experience: I went here for my birthday and loved it. They had such tasty cocktails and great cuts of meat, which they brought out to show us and explain each cut. Since we came for my birthday, they also had the option to leave a birthday message on the dessert we ordered. When we ordered a black coffee and they brought a cappuccino, I let them know so that they could exchange it and they took it off the bill altogether. They are clearly very eager to please. 

Environment: Clearly a fine dining place. They have a walkway along a wall of windows where you can look out at all the places in Singapore. The windows are marked with small signs noting what part of the city it is (chinatown, downtown, etc). 

Food: The steak was so good. I got the flat iron which was known for its high marbling rating (I think it was 6-7+), but you can always ask them there for more details. All of the sides were good too, but the main dishes that stuck out were the steaks and the desserts: the pavlova was delicious, and such a hard dessert to get right. 

Price: It's a nice place to be prepared to pay top dollar. Steaks are anywhere for $60-$100+ and even a cocktail is $20-$25. I'm sure you can get other dishes not quite as expensive as the steaks, but I think that is the main appeal of a nice place like this. 

Service: Fantastic, but a little slow towards the end (when we ordered small things like coffee to finish off the meal).",15/1/2019,Food & Beverage
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,"The obvious wow factor for this place is the sweeping view. We went to dinner and had unfettered view of the Singapore skyline - that was remarkable. 

The food is generally good, with some misses. We did not care about the crab omelette that came highly recommended. But the Bungalow pork and octopus were both great starters. For mains, the sirloin was overly crusted but was good. Grilled asparagus on the side was also very good. I would rate the food a solid 3.5-stars but pushed it up to four for the excellent wine recommendation. 

Service here is strange. The disposition of the staff is wonderful. They are all friendly without being patronising. But there were service lapses. For example, we ordered three starters. Two were served together, then there was a 45-minute wait before the third one arrived.

The food is supposedly ""Modern Australian"", but you don't have to care what it's called, just know that it's marvellously good. All the ingredients are fresh, the dishes unique and the presentation impeccable.

And no wonder: it's opened by celebrity chef Luke Mangan and there are only seven of such restaurants worldwide (although one of his proteges have taken over the running of the Singapore branch). 

I had the Maori Lakes beef tenderloin, which is so good my vocabulary fails me. The Barramundi fillet is also fantastic, but not everybody will like the sauce it comes in. And if you love sashimi, you have to try their version!

They do have a wide array of cuts, and I loved that they brought over a giant platter and explained which cut was served for each dish. It made it easier to chose. Their meat was pretty good, though mine was a little over (asked for rare, but it was closer to medium rare/medium). Their red wine sauce was really good though! 

Francis and I were a little over ambitious and thought we could finish a side of asparagus, oyster mushrooms, and onsen egg, but we couldn't. This side dish did taste a little strange though, still can't figure out why I didn't like it that much. 

Dessert was average, the chocolate lava cake was slightly over baked so it didn't ooze out nicely.

Salt Grill & Sky Bar,3,"Salt Grill & Sky Bar offers decent food and decent service in an attractive venue with an exceptional view.  The venue and view lived up to expectations.  The food and service, unfortunately, only lived up to the rather low standards I have come to expect from restaurants on the top floor of tall buildings.  Don't get me wrong about this.  Their food and service were not bad at all but I was hoping for better.  

Next time I want to treat guests to a nice view, I will take them to the Singapore Flyer and then take them to dinner at a great restaurant at ground level that can successfully compete based on the quality of its food rather than its views.

By the way, don't waste your money on the Spanish Ortiz anchovy appetizer.  The menu accurately states on that the anchovies are served in the tin with garlic bread but I assumed there would be some creativity involved.  There wasn't. Just an open tin of anchovies and some garlic bread.

Go here for the view!",14/11/2014,Food & Beverage
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,3,"I had been to this restaurant a number of times, but this was the first I was coming for afternoon tea. The Afternoon Tea Platter costs $38++ per person, inclusive of a tea or coffee, or $53++ per person including a glass of G.H Mumm Champagne. It is available from 2.30pm to 4:45pm. The coffee is non refillable, while as for tea one could ask for refillable of hot water.

The afternoon tea platter consisted of 
Crostini, avocado, cherry tomato, olive,
Ham & turkey, beetroot, manchego, tortilla,
Smoked salmon, cucumber, chive, crème cheese on rye,
Chocolate & jam lamington,
Coffee macaroon,
Tim tam chocolate tart,
Red velvet cup cake,
Anzac biscuit,
Citrus marshmallow, and
Scones.

The tea set was nicely plated but I felt that it was a bit too overpriced for such little food. May I was expecting much more from this price. The Citrus marshmallow is my favourite as it had a rather zesty taste which peaked one up. The rest were not bad too.

I had requested for a table by the window through online reservation, but was showed to a table by the frosted window with no view of the outside. Not sure if it was due to the fact that I was having a 3 years old boy with me at the time. We were seated far away from other customers and had difficulties getting the attention of the staff. As it was between lunch and dinner meal times, there was limited choices for a 3 years old. No children menu, so ended up ordering French fries ($11++) for him. Total bill for the fries was $12.95.",28/12/2015,Food & Beverage
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,3,"The food wasn't memorable or anything. I opted with the tasting menu so I can at least enjoy the scenic views a little bit longer, but I soon realized halfway into the tasting menu, that I just wanted to leave. 

The food wasn't bad, but this was no fine dining. The dessert which was the apple and liquorice cream was the only decent thing from the menu.

So lesson learned...if you visit Salt Grill, stick with the regular menu, or just hang out at the bar and order at least $80 worth of drinks since that's the minimum amount to hang out here. But it will probably only take you 2-3 drinks to get to this amount since cocktails will run around $25 a drink.

Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,"Restaurant Week lunch. I have always wanted to try the food at Salt Grill & Sky Bar but it is always full during restaurant week, well, except for this week. 

Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 stars: 
The experience was marred from the beginning when I saw the email on Tuesday (they sent it Sunday afternoon, but I didn't check email till Tuesday...some people are not chained by email :p) where it asked if I could change my dining time to 11.30 am or 11.45 am instead of 12 pm. The reason was due to the overwhelming response and so we will only have 1 hour 15 mins to dine if we come at 12 pm.

The question that pop into my head was ""didn't they already have a fix number of tables for Restaurant Week""? and ""Why was this not indicated when making the booking?"" And this was not the first time Salt has participated in Restaurant Week, wouldn't they have known better on what to expect?

It is quite disconcerting to have to re-arrange our schedule just so we will not have a rushed lunch. In any case, we decided to change our reservations to 11.30 am. I got there just before 11.30 am and was told the restaurant was not ready as the staff are getting their briefing then. 2nd strike. I made the effort to be on time, and at the time suggested by the restaurant, I would expect to be granted the courtesy to be seated accordingly. Cooling my heels for a while, it was another 5-10 minutes later before I was finally shown to a table. 

The ""3rd"" not so happy experience was very minor - I asked for a window table but I was told it was for non-restaurant week customers...that reason did not fly with me as a friend had the window table the day before and she was also dining on Restaurant Week menu. Anyway, that was really a minor thing but the whole pre-dining experience was enough to make me put Salt on the ""first and last time"" dining list. 


Back to the place and food:

I like the simplicity of the place with its high ceiling and modern furnishing. Service was professional, attentive, polite and not overly friendly. What caught me by surprise was the basket the manager brought over for us to put our bags. That was thoughtful. 

Water was topped up without having to ask (they do ask if you want still or sparkling water, but you could request for warm or iced tap water at no extra cost), the courses were well paced  so we did not feel rushed. In the end we left slightly after 1.15 pm, but never once were we made to feel we had to hurry through the meal. So kudos to the service staff for making the actual dining experience to be enjoyable after all.

Restaurant Week Menu:
Starter - chicken liver foie gras parfait, truffled butter, toasted brioche. This was really superb. A generous serving of smooth pate in a small jar which went very well with the brioche and complimentary bread 

Main - Maori lakes tenderloin, blue cheese pressed potato, spinach and red wine jus. I asked for medium and it was done just right, not too bloody with a bit of pink in the center. The meat was just so tender and juicy (still cannot compare to American beef in flavor) that it was with sadness when I popped in the last bite. I wished it was a bigger portion. Just have to come back next time for the 200 gm served in the ala carte menu. The pressed potato (in thin slices) with blue cheese was ok, just a hint of blue cheese so those who do not like it will not be turned off by it. 

Dessert - tasting platter 
Creme Brulee with salted caramel ice cream - my favorite of the lot. Creamy custard covered with the sugar glaze and topped with salted caramel ice cream. There were also chocolate pearls hidden giving it a nice crunch.

Chocolate bar - surprisingly I did not find it that great. There were some wafer bits which tasted a bit soft, not crispy at all. 

Licorice ice cream with lime and sago - never a big fan of licorice though the lime did give it a bit of contrasting flavor and made it more palatable to me.

Coffee was normal. You could select the tea of your choice, you just have to ask them what is available. 

So yes, I would want to go back again, just to have the tenderloin and for the view. It is a very nice view and will probably be fantastic to dine in the evening to see the sunset.

3. The lunch set menu was so much cheaper than we expected, at $49 for 3 courses including tea or coffee. what a bargain, considering the location and the fact that the dishes mimicked that of dishes at fine dining, or were even better. 
4. the dishes were so delicious! to start, they gave us complimentary radish snack with homemade potato chips.

for Entree, we got:
-'Glass' Sydney crab omelette in miso mustard broth, their signature dish which was okay for me, but D loved it. 
-Baked bone marrow, onion, watercress, and garlic toast.   this is the entree to get. bone marrow was the best I've tried in a long time! It was prepared in such a way that I've never tried before, drenched in garlic and other sauces, and it was just perfection with the garlic toast pairing.

Main course:
-Seared Blue Fin tuna, potato, pimento, softquail egg, olives & anchovies dressing:  never thought i'd write a comment on an egg, but i've never tried an egg that was cooked So perfectly that it's bouncy yet so soft.  tuna and all the ingredients came together so well.
-Goats cheese gnocchi, beets, vincotto, burnt butter dressing, pistachio, raisons: again, the ingredients in the dish came together so well, that we were forking everything together in one-bite to experience the bursting of flavors. it was perfect. 

dessert:
we got the sorbet, crumbs and berries and dessert of the day which was a winner. 

We exited the restaurant as if we paid over $200 for the service, location, and the amazing food, when it was around $110 altogether. Why didn't we come sooner? it's a perfect place for dates, girl dates, and for visitors as well!",12/2/2016,Food & Beverage
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,5,"My husband and I recently celebrated my birthday here, and I had a wonderful time! (I say ""I"" because I stuck him with the bill at the end of the night!)

Salt Grill is an awesome place for a special occasion dinner, and I also agree with the other reviewers who say it's a good venue for treating out your parental units.

To get there, head to the concierge at the 4th floor of Ion. Walk around the desk and you'll see the welcome area for Salt. Someone will guide you to the special elevator bank that will whisk you up to the 55th floor.

Walking into the main dining room, your breath will be taken away by the lovely views of Singapore. I'm glad we went here for dinner because I enjoyed watching the city light up and transition from early evening to dusk.

To start, we ordered the oysters (served natural), and the 'glass' Sydney crab omelette. I can't comment on the oysters as I'm allergic, but I will say the Sydney crab omelette was a-ok. I know people rave about it, but it's simply not my type of dish.

However, I really loved our main. We did the meat cut for two, which changes daily. That day, it was a bone-in ribeye. It came with onion rings, a rocket salad, and mash. Miguel doesn't like potatoes much, so we asked if we could replace the mash with the roast garlic mushrooms and luckily they obliged.

The rocket salad was my type of salad: blue cheese, pear, and candied walnuts. All so good! The steak was juicy and I loved the horseradish/pepper jus that it was drenched in. Throw in a decent bottle of wine (we decided on a cab sauv from California) and we were in heaven. 

For a moment, I was worried because the table next to us brought a baby with them... but thankfully the baby was quiet and didn't disturb our dinner. Overall, the ambiance was set nicely with the dim lighting and bossa nova soundtrack in the background. The service was impeccable and we didn't feel rushed at all throughout the evening. If you're feelin' spendy, this is a great option to consider. :)",30/7/2014,Food & Beverage
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,"third restaurant week date in a row!

for the uninitiated, you need to head to the 4th floor of ion, where the visitor's info booth is.
their reception is co located there.
they will then show you the way to a separate lift to the premises.
they open at 6pm sharp, so even if you are early you cant get in.

this is definitely a date impressing kind of place.
the view reminds me of equinox and jaan.

this is the most expensive of the restaurant week menu priced at $55.
so in effect you are probably paying $20 for the view?

the restaurant week set dinner is made up of 3 courses:

for the first course, we had the 'glass' Sydney crab omelette, miso mustard broth.
nice flavour from the crab as well as the mild miso mustard broth.
lots of garnishing on top which can be a nightmare for some.

for the main, the spatchcock is highly recommended.
a juvenile chicken butterflied for faster cooking.
it was very well seasoned and cooked to perfection.
tender to the fork and juicy in the mouth.
the grape and currant dressing gave the dish a sweet edge.
the parsnip mash is also a nice change from the usual mash that we get.

for dessert, you get a liquorice parfait in lime jus.
can sound foul to some, including myself, who is not a fan of liquorice.
but to my utter surprise, i was won over and really enjoyed it!
the liquorice was used in moderation.
and it was cleverly musked by the fresh lime juice, zest and lime fruit slices.
you still get an after taste of liquorice but not a strong lingering one.
pieces of thin biscuit wafer were delightfully crisp and buttery.

the coffee that came with the set was sad!
i guess i am comparing it to the one i had at latteria which was awesome.
one sip and i abandoned ship.
maybe it would be safer for you to go with their tea instead.

if you would like wine to accompany your meal, they do have 2 special offer for restaurant week.
however, we chose to go with the luke mangan's red and white wine by the glass in their ala carte menu.

now for the ala carte orders:

i started with the Fig tart with caramelized onion and blue cheese, verjuice
dressing.
the waiter duly reminded that it will take 12 mins to prepare this dish.
must be really good then!:)
it did not disappoint.
the figs could be sweeter though.
a thin pastry base topped with caramelized onions then round flat slices of fresh figs and finally some melted blue cheese and some sprouts.
again the blue cheese may not go well with some, but i liked it.

for mains, i had the Scotch 250g Rangers Valley VIC 300 days grain fed.
grilled to medium and served on a bed of french beans with red wine jus.
i had the english mustard and horse radish on the side.
the beef was not spectacular.
cooked as requested but only average in flavour.
priced at $75, again you must be paying $20 for the view?

we also ordered a side of Broccolini with confit eschallot.
i must say they do their veg very well.
not one strand was overcooked.
all al dente.
they could, however, be more generous with their confit eschallot though.

service staff here are obviously all seasoned ones and very well drilled.
japanese style efficiency in just in time precision.

more hits than misses and if you are willing to pay more for the view and romantic ambience then you will be a fan too.",11/10/2012,Food & Beverage
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,5,"I'm very particular about food and it's rare to find such a superb restaurant around these parts! We visited for their Sunday Brunch menu which at $40++ per head including juice and tea/coffee, is very much value for money. The menu only has a few options to choose from, and then you can pick two sides from the list to go with it. 

When our food arrived, it looked and tasted divine. I went for the eggs benedict with the smoked salmon gravlax, served with spinach on a couple of their own made crumpets. I chose the wagyu sausage and the pear and blue cheese salad for my sides. I would recommend everything that was on my plate, especially the wagyu sausage! 

The staff are very friendly and host a very relaxing atmosphere. 

We arrived slightly early and walked around ION Sky. I would highly recommend doing this as the views of Singapore and beyond are fab. If you are unfamiliar with your surroundings, there are signs showing what is where. 

The only downside, one which I found a little cheeky, is that if you wish to have a window table, then you must pay an additional $20 for the privilege. I had booked a table for 11am and although the restaurant was pretty much empty, we were sat in the centre of the room. The views are still fab though! 

I would definitely return if I ever have the opportunity.",24/8/2014,Food & Beverage

Salt Grill & Sky Bar,5,"I like to dine with the world under my feet and if you do too, then scoot over to the newly refreshed Salt Grill &amp; Sky Bar at ION Orchard which provides a magnificent landscape of the Orchard Road skyline with their full glass floor-to-ceiling windows that span two storeys high. Swanky it is, Salt grill &amp; Sky Bar serves up some Modern Australian cuisine by celebrity chef-restaurateur Luke Mangan and is known for its one-of-a-kind experience that begins even before guests enter the restaurant. Special concierge reception, private lift, exclusive dining area... it's hard not to feel special here.

Modern Australian cuisine is an intersection of influences from cuisines around the world and i could taste that rightaway in the Amuse Bouche, Coconut broth with Sydney spice. Flavor-wise, it tasted very much like Thai Green Curry without the spice.

We then proceeded with our wine and dine event and our dishes were paired with drinks from the Award Winning New World Wine List of the Year 2013 by the World Gourmet Summit. There is also the signature range of eponymous 'Luke Mangan' wines which are produced in one of Australia's leading wine estates - TarraWarra Estate in Yarra Valley, which Chef Mangan was personally involved in the selection of the grapes and the blending of the wines.

Spring vegetables were served with the mild goats curd, ginger bread crumbs and dried black olives ($31). These are probably sous vide to seal in the freshness of spring.

I love my eggs and the 'Glass' Sydney crab omelette ($33) totally won me over with the precious sheets of runny egg in the center, enoki mushroom and herb salad in miso mustard broth. A generous serving of sweet crab meat was wrapped in the golden parcel. This is certainly a light dish that is refreshing with a basil taste (again, this is almost Thai food). 

Signature starters include the Tea smoked quail ($31), an original creation in which the bird is smoked with a combination of earl grey tea and rice, and nicely paired with almond cream, prunes, truffled grains (i believe there is quinoa), grilled shallot, sorrel. There are so many dimensions and flavors to this dish and i was slowly savoring each component. I haven't had prunes in a dish for sometime and it went well with the smokey tender quail.

For mains, we had the Sirloin Rangers Valley, New South Wales, 300 days grain fed Wagyu ($74). Moroccan spice, sauté spinach, eggplant puree, red wine sauce  Wasabi, whole grain mustard. Fantastic aubergine spiced purée. Pick your cut from the meat board before having it grilled to your preference (only medium rare for me).

Dessert was pleasantly surprising with Luke's liquorice parfait ($18). I don't quite like licorice but i was amazed at how interesting the flavor and texture worked together especially with lime. You gotta try it for yourself.",11/5/2014,Food & Beverage

Salt Grill & Sky Bar,5,"Dining at @saltgrillandskybar #beautifulplace #wonderfulservice #greatfood starting with tasty chips on the house, followed by insightful knowledge while being served red wine . Restaurant uses #coravin to serve their wine, which helps preserves the wine within the bottle without opening it #genius even the bread  served was fragrant & went well with the olive oil & smashed nuts. Before serving the starters, the waitress, Eve, took out a crumber/crumb scoop/crumb picker... whatever you call it, & cleared the bread crumbs from the table with amazing efficiency! The starters continued to impress our taste buds as the shrimp sauce blended nicely with the scallop to deliver a fresh, yet full flavor. It was so good that we wiped it off our plates in the blink of an eye  mains came shortly after, & I must say that the pace at which the food was served wasn't too fast, & not too slow, which helped create a great transition between the dishes. Barramundi with prawn  tempura for me, & medium tenderloin for Serena. The full dish name was too long & I didn't note it down.

We had a few starters before the mains. While the portions were not large, they were delicious. There was nice spacing between courses.

The service was fairly relaxed, but could have used a little more attention for the prices. I would also expect a few more chef's tasters provided given the price tag. Sure this Singapore, but they can learn some things from other restaurants especially in LA.",30/4/2013,Food & Beverage

Salt Grill & Sky Bar,2,"Overall: Had we stopped after the first course, this rating would be 5 stars.

The lift lobby and lift are pretty snazzy and in keeping with the 'sky' theme.  Entering the restaurant you are greeted with floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall views of the Singapore skyline. Beautiful space, elegant decore, romantic lighting make it a great choice for our first date night in Singapore. When booking I mentioned the occasion and requested window table which we were given though all tables have a skyline view.. 

We started with a bottle of Mum, the 'glass' crab omelette and the foie gras. 
The fluffy, delicate omelette was served in a broth that was packed full of flavour. Foie gras became one of my favourite dishes when I visited Budapest. I order it at nearly every opportunity.This version did not disappoint but the plate itself didn't really flow. The perfectly cooked scallop seemed a bit extraneous.

It basically went straight downhill from there. Our mains (snapper and kingfish) were fine but both over cooked. Dessert was ok, Coffees were outrageously overpriced. Service started off acceptable and dropped exponentially over the evening.",24/9/2015,Food & Beverage
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,3,"The location, view and decor was top class! The service and staff was quite good and the general atmosphere very pleasant. However, you walk through a shopping mall going in and again coming out which somehow lessens the experience (in my opinion) and leads me to wonder why the architects would not have considered having the lift run all the way to the ground floor instead. This is for sure not the fault of the restaurant. 

Nonetheless, the food, while being good, is somewhat overpriced. For 70+ sgd  for a steak there is an expectation that is not quite matched. Especially as the entrees are not served with much else, and each side dish at 10+ sgd, the costs run high quickly. Having said that the presentation is great as is the wine selection, the amuses bouches and the drinks.

I would absolutely recommend this place to have a drink, some appetizers and enjoy the view, but for a great steak, I would go elsewhere for value-money.",3/10/2015,Food & Beverage

the food here strikes me as being classic but-not-really, very exquisite and rather well made - and very much in line with what I expect from a chinese restaurant inside a hotel: good service, food that's interesting but still familiar, and a peaceful ambience.

we did a fair bit of their smallish menu - and it was all pretty good. the food at my favourite paradise pavilion is a little more modern-interesting and might be tastier - but there's just something about sitting in a hotel-housed chinese restaurant that has all the pomp and luxuriance you just don't get in a stand-alone place.

The fried rice was abundant but not particularly flavorful. The vegetables were ok and we'll prepared. The tea was very nice. Service was good enough.

Summer Pavilion,4,"Came by for dinner the other night and it was a decent experience. Made a reservation with the Ritz-Carlton online and received an e-mail confirmation a couple of days prior to dining. 

Drop off from my driver was easy and uniformed bell hops were eager to assist. Summer Pavilion is tucked away in the back left of the hotel lobby and was unmarked from the lobby, a touch odd. The Ritz is definitely ""classic"" luxury. 

Clientele seemed touristy, including some loud tourists from mainland China speaking in their outdoor voices inside the restaurant... Staff wore a uniform, name tag, and a mask. Some staff even wore vinyl gloves.

Despite being a Michelin 1 star for Cantonese cuisine, the experience was more of a Westernized appraoch to Cantonese cuisine...

Ordered mainly from the Chef's Recommendation menu and started off with the scallop and eggplant. The Hokaido scallop was poached and seared perfectly. The shrimp paste inside the eggplant was on the blander side and now I understand why I was offered chili to complement this... 

Moved on to the seared Japanese wagyu beef with wild mushrooms and it was a slightly bizarre experience. Both the scallop and beef course were served with a side of knife and fork...I wasn't sure what was so Cantonese about this dish...might have been more Japanese/Western fusion?!?

The highlight of the meal was the fish noodle with Canadian lobster. The fish noodles were world class with a perfect al dente texture from what seemed to be fish paste. The Canadian lobster was decent, although I'm sure I've had fresher lobster in Canada...

Ended off the meal with the mango sago and it was a disappointment. The highlight were the fresh and flavorful mangos, same as I was able to find at the local grocery store. The actual sago was on the bland side...bummer.

Service throughout the meal was attentive, although not quite up to par with Michelin-rated standards. There was some overlap with the presentation of utensils for the next course before the current course was complete...felt like the courses were being rushed?!?

We got the har gow, siu mai, fried dumplings, glutinous pastry and goose liver fried rice.  

The fried rice was great but the rest were above average....but that's kind of like the minimum expected from a restaurant like this.

We ordered some of the usual dim sum dishes, har gao, soup dumplings etc.  The food was delicate, and expertly prepared.  Expensive yes, but this is really the kind of restaurant you'd go for a special occasion.

We also ordered a unique noodle dish - fried fish noodles, which was my favorite.  The noodles are actually made with fish (and presumably some starch to keep it together)!  Had great bounce to the texture, which was surprising.

Upscale dim sum isn't exactly my cup of tea, as I'd rather prefer the hustle and bustle of dim sum, but it was one of those experiences that you just have to try once!",28/6/2019,Food & Beverage
Cloud Forest,5,"If you even remotely like flowers and nature, then this is a MUST SEE! 
I love flowers and plants so I was blown away by the sheer beauty of how everything was so beautifully laid out. This is an indoor attraction, kinda like a giant greenhouse so it's actually a nice escape from the humid hot mess outdoors. There is a man-made waterfall in the center and it's quite a statement! You follow the pathway to go up and get a great view of the city through the windows. This whole attraction is gram worthy so be ready to take lots of photos and selfies!",15/12/2024,Arts
Cloud Forest,4,"Not the Supertree Observatory, the Cloud Forest is a 2 acre greenhouse that's part of the Gardens by the Bay. 

Next door to the Flower, I recommend getting a ticket package to see everything in the area. Staff at the ticket counter were super helpful is getting me the best bundle for every thing I want to see.  Plus advice on what order. 

This huge structure has paved walkways, stairs and escalators, but expect to walk a lot. From ground level you can take your time and wander through the gardens filled with many species of flowers and plants as you work your way to the top of the 35 meter waterfall. It's the world's tallest indoor waterfall. Nine levels, each a different theme- Cloud Walk, Lost World, Crystal Mountain, Tree Top Walk Secret Garden, Cloud Forest Theater, Waterfall View, The Cavern, and Gallery. 

It's the perfect spot to explore during one of Singapore's rain showers.  

I walked over to Gardens by the Bay to explore along the way. But Gardens by the Bay MRT is the closest station.",4/2/2024,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,"Get transported into the magical world of Pandora.

The Cloud Forest at Gardens by the Bay created an immersive experience inspired by the movie Avatar. So interesting to see the mystical world brought to life across the iconic cascading waterfalls, beautiful gardens and elevated walkways in the Cloud Forest. 

Separated into five zones, a life-size banshee welcomes visitors to the World of Pandora. Loved the beautiful pathways lit up at night in a splash of colors. 

As you explore each zone, there are docents that operate a puppet baby banshee and baby viperwolf as well as other audio and visual representations of the film. Cute to snap a selfie. 

Other highlights included the cavern with stalagmites and stalactites, the collection of white Dale Chihuly glass and the Orchid Haven. The ""Cloud Mountain"" itself is amazing. It is covered in orchids, ferns, mosses and bromeliads. I bet without the Avatar Experience, it still would have been amazing. 

Afterwards, head to the Supertree Grove for the sound and light show. It is the perfect way to spend the evening at Gardens by the Bay.",2/1/2024,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,"Even with part of it under construction this was still an amazing activity while in Singapore. Plus if it's hot or rainy, this is especially good bc it's enclosed and air conditioned. I would try to time it so you're there for the misting times, which we unfortunately missed (no pun intended) but after seeing photos it seems like it would be worth the time sticking around to see.",9/7/2024,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,"What a dream! the flora. The variety of flora. The flora at every turn.

Must see. Be in awe, leave in awe. 

We were lucky enough that they had the Avatar display when we visited. 

It is cool in the area so it was nice to be away from the blistering Singapore heat.",17/10/2024,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,Amazing multi level multi sensory experience at Cloud Forest by the Marina Bay gardens. Every hours there is mist the is sprayed created a cloud like environment surrounding you. It can get quite busy. I suggest coming at night as it's a bit less busy and you also get a different experience with the lights and mist contrasted by the outdoor darkness. It's conveniently located right by the marina bay gardens where you can also catch the outdoor light and sound show by the giant tree forest.,17/8/2024,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,Honestly this is a great place to visit. To get there you might have to walk a bit of a distance in mostly hot and humid weather.  Inside the natural air-conditioning will be a huge blessing. The beautiful tall waterfall and the walk down from the top.  Unfortunately it is a popular route and you have to work your way between people taking pictures.  Stop at any point and enjoy the view from the inside and outside.  Also to enjoy the flora and fauna all around you. It's a great place to to visit and I highly recommend it.,4/6/2024,Arts
Cloud Forest,4,"Located in Gardens by the Bay, the Cloud Forest is a must-visit attraction, and the highlight for many. The waterfalls are majestic and gardens are impeccable. I went during the Avatar Experience and I was just floored by how detailed and cool everything was presented. I liked the occasionally misting so you really feel like you're on another planet.

If you find yourself in Singapore, you must come here!",18/7/2023,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,"This place is amazing. You can find cloud forest inside of Gardens by the bay. You will need to purchase a ticket to go inside of Cloud forest as well as Flower Dome.
It's multiple floors of nature with an Avatar theme, which makes it really cool.
You can send an hour in there just walking around, taking pics, and being in awe.

Definitely recommend going. I would say go closer to sunset for this one.",13/9/2023,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,"Visiting botanical gardens are not really my thing, but because of how hot it is in Singapore, it was a nice 2 some hour break from the heat in a temperature controlled greenhouse. There is a lot more to offer than the exotic plants itself, as there's a waterfall upon entering the facility. You can get amazing views of the surrounding areas as you ascend to the top and make your way down. It gets crowded so if you're looking for photo ops, going to need some patience.",9/6/2024,Arts
Cloud Forest,3,"While the interior of this modern building is impressive, the crowds are insane! You move at a glacial pace while thousands of people crowd into a tiny space, slowly navigating the exhibits while uncomfortably close to strangers as you climb higher and higher throughout the tour. It's uncomfortable, congested, and you can count on rude tourists attempting to push their way past.

Visitors are much better off going to the Flower Garden next door, a very open, uncrowded space that doesn't funnel its visitors into narrow spaces, where you're free to walk around in an environment with copious amounts of plants.",14/7/2025,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,"Easily our favorite attraction to visit in Singapore and show friends! 
Things you should know:
I. PARKING
Ordering a grab to get here is relatively easy. I recommend that as your form of arrival and departure so you don't need to worry about parking. Parking has ample spaces available, but I would consider the fee expensive. 
II. SERVICE 
You can buy your tickets online in advance. As for food? I know of a McDonalds on the grounds ~ aside from that... If you want healthy food. I would eat beforehand. 
III. RECOMMENDATIONS
Everything about the gardens is beautiful and well maintained . If I had to recommend what you viewed ~ I would tell you to get tickets for the Cloud Forest and the SuperGrove Tree Observatory. Ideally, you'll want to start at the cloud forest, during daylight hours (17:00-17:30) and then make your way to the SuperGrove Tree Observatory at night. The skyline is most beautifully seen when the sun is down! 
III. CAPACITY 
Avoid holidays here! It gets quite crowded. However, if unavailable, it's STILL worth seeing.",15/4/2025,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,"Beautiful gardens!  Interesting, dynamic and gorgeous.   The dinosaurs were well done and fun.   Totally recommend!",28/6/2025,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,"I really liked the cloud forest side and the Jurassic experience. For me, I could have skipped the flower dome but I liked this side quite a bit. You only need about an hour to visit, if you already have tickets, which you can buy online.",30/7/2025,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,"You might feel flowered out at some point in Singapore. Regardless. you must made a point of visiting the Cloud Forest. Home to an amazing orchid collection, you'll also find a beautiful waterfall, and immersive digital experience, and multiple floors of temperature control (I.e., air conditioning).

I recommend you block off at least 2-hours, making the price of admission more than fair. I came in the morning to avoid crowds, however, heard like other parts of the Gardens by the Bay, it gets lit up beautifully - however I cannot confirm. Enjoy!",14/10/2024,Arts
Cloud Forest,4,We loved this exhibit- very cool and all indoors. We enjoyed the interactive parts and the overall experience. We took the MRT to get here which was very easy. Staff was friendly as well! Would recommend to anyone visiting Singapore!,10/4/2025,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,"Amazing experience. 
I knew I'd like it, but didn't know I'd LOVE it. 
Being in a dome was a great way to escape the rain. But the place is so well thought out and majestic I could have spent more time. Great for photo ops. 
Nicer when there aren't huge crowds to contend with. 
Just amazing. Loved every minute.",27/3/2025,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,"The Cloud Forest is a glass greenhouse in the Gardens by the Bay, that's full of interesting flora and informative details about the items you're seeing.

Cloud Forest looks similar to its neighbor, the Flower Dome, but i it's higher and more narrow. 

The pièce de résistance of Cloud Forest is the Cloud Mountain in the middle, which is made up of flowers, ferns, and other plant life, and has a beautiful waterfall tumbling down its front.

It's definitely an amazing photo stop and Insta-worthy, along with the super cool info you can learn - so definitely worth a stop if you're already exploring the Gardens by the Bay!",7/11/2024,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,"This is a MUST... what a lovely escape from the heat and be surrounded by nature!  The flowers and various greenery scales upward and all around... man made waterfall and the pathway around the dome, gives you awesome view of the bay... 

Everything is organized, easy to navigate and follow. 

Great way to spend time indoors in a cool environment away from the humidity and rain!

Cloud Forest,5,This was fun.  Metal trees that float above the  jungle.  You need to go straight to the ticket center.  You can buy passes to walk across the bridge and to go to the observatory.  You may as well do both while you are there.,15/4/2024,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,"One of my favorite attractions from my visit to Singapore! Gardens by the Bay is definitely a touristy area, but Cloud Forest is a must-see. Right when you walked in you're greeted by a beautiful waterfall which really sets the tone for the rest of the attraction. I was worried about it being humid with all the plants and watering they must need to do, but it actually ended up being nice and cool. 

During our visit in December 2022, there was a special Avatar display going on here which was interesting, but honestly I think I would've preferred to see the place without it. 

Definitely add this to your list of places to see in Singapore. You can't miss it!",22/1/2023,Arts
Cloud Forest,4,(4.25) ~ Very good Overall experience with a beautiful waterfall. The air quality is amazing. You need a ticket for this one and there's a nice gift shop at the end.,29/6/2024,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,"Visited the Cloud Forest while on my honeymoon trip in Singapore with my husband. I could've spent an entire day there! I was mesmerized by all of the unique, beautiful plants. It was an adventure to climb our way through 7 floors of lush tropical gardens. The Cloud Forest is a must visit when visiting Singapore.",12/2/2023,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,"The Cloud Forrest is an attraction at the Gardens by the Bay.  It is one of the two domes to explore.  Inside the Cloud Forrest is a huge, and I mean huge, man made water fall.  It is quite spectacular.  There are multiple levels to explore in this enclosure.  It literally feels like walking into a rain forrest and being transported to another planet.  

I came here in the evening and there was something magical about the Cloud Forrest that stood out from the flower dome.  There were stalactites and crystals that you can admire.   If you explore the dome in the day, you will be pleased that it is all AC inside.  

I would suggest to explore the dome both in the day and evening since the natural lighting from outside will change the atmosphere of the dome.

Have fun!!!",1/1/2021,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,"The Cloud Forest is one of my favourite places in Singapore. I guess if you're too lazy to travel around the world to find every single plant in nature, this is a good place to go. The fake waterfall was tall. The plants and flowers were pretty. In the kids' play area, the quicksand was FAULTY! Someone needs to fix that ASAP.",4/8/2022,Arts
Cloud Forest,4,"This is a absolute favorite. If you made the trek to the gardens by the bay, put up some cash for a trip to this enchanted forest and garden up in the clouds. 

The tiered levels as you ascend makes it feel and smell like you are in the clouds. If can get a bit misty and foggy in parts as you make your way up. 

There's every mix and color of orchids you could think up. So many unusual blends of gorgeous and wild flowers everywhere. 

It's a result of the beauty nature can yield if left to their own devices.",10/3/2020,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands so it was a no-brainer to stop by the Cloud Forest because it was within walking distance and came with good recommendations from local friends.  

Upon arrival, we were met with a cool breeze and spray  from an indoor waterfall, a cool  that you won't find often in Singapore. That alone was the worth the price of admission.  We were so Impressed by the variety of tropical plants, the orchids, and the setting of each area.

The skill of the conservation is amazing and is extraordinary.  There are around seven levels to explore with different themes or focus.  I felt like I was in an unreal bubble looking out towards the real world, which also seemed unreal because the whole city of Singapore is an architectural marvel.

I would really recommend visiting the Cloud Forest and also leaving extra time for the Flower Dome because we regretted missing it.",28/11/2019,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,"Out of all the features of Gardens by the Bay, the Cloud Forest has to be my absolute favorite destinations!

The Cloud Forest is an immersive and lush experience that's sure to take your breath away. Right when you walk in, you're greeted by a massive hill of green that houses more plants, exhibits, and a sky walkway.

Highlights of this whole exhibit for me would have to include: the orchid garden and the sky walkway. The orchid garden is small but carefully curated. All hybrids chosen to be displayed are beautiful and have different aromas. Don't be afraid to stop and smell all of them! Additionally, the sky walkway is a seemingly expansive trail above the Cloud Forest that gives you various views around the whole building. There's various stops on the sky walkway that will give you informational exhibits about plants, landforms, and so much more. 

Overall, a magical way to spend your day!",19/7/2019,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,Bought the ticket combo deal. Cloud forest was one of the better attractions. Lots of things to see and do. They even had the avartar attractions that was very cool. The place has about 6 level and a lot of interactive things to do. Lots of places to take picture. I prefer this place than flower dome. If your short on time go here instead.,17/2/2023,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,"Buying a ticket to Cloud Forest feels like buying a ticket to the year 3019. Right from your first step into the wonderfully air-conditioned greenhouse you're instantly greeted by a larger-than life waterfall, ripped straight out of a scene from Avatar. 

Plant people, architecture afficionados, and those on the quest to become/stay Insta-famous will all find a slice of heaven in this modern marvel. The variety of plant species and flowers on display are almost overwhelmingly plentiful. The walkways and supporting structures throughout this mega greenhouse are truly well designed and rival those of science fiction. Finally, there are several platforms to take in views and living walls that make for picturesque backdrops, all enough to make any Instagram addict foam at the mouth. 

Singapore's Cloud Garden is a wonderful place to feel inspired and truly awe struck. Enjoy your stroll through the greenhouse of the future!",14/1/2019,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,"The better of the two. I came for the rainfall...It did not disappoint.

The best view is at the entrance and looking up at the rain fall. The rest of the Cloud Forest is exploring plants that grow in a forest condition. Quite impressed with the design and creativity that thought to have a water fall in a greenhouse. The other best feeling is the air conditioning- a great way to spend 2 hours away from the hot weather.",26/12/2018,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,"It's MAGIC you have to go if you are in SG.  

If you have only enough time to do either the Flower dome or the Cloud forest do the Cloud forest.  

I can't describe in words how amazing this place is.  
You walk around the bottom floor and then go up around this central rainforest ""mountain.""

Probably the best part about SG.",9/3/2019,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,"Wow.  This is hands down the best greenhouse I've ever been to in my life.  

You walk into a cooled building and are greeted with a pretty waterfall surrounded by lush greenery and vivid flowers.  This is enough to make the ticket price worth it as it is a nice reprieve from the heat outside.  

You go through the many levels of plants and see rare flowers that you probably would never see in your lifetime.  There are also cool ""native"" artworks from Southeast Asia interspersed throughout the foliage.  

The best part for me was the surprising ending where they give you information about climate change.  I think the way they did it was very well thought out and not preachy which I believe helps people want to stop and listen.  

If you're in Gardens by the Bay, this is a must stop sight!",20/12/2018,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,"The cloud forest is one of the attractions at the gardens and is inside one of the large domes. 

I don't know exactly why it's called the cloud forest.  The dome may be as high as the clouds outside or there may actually be some clouds inside from the waterfall and rain they have created there. 

It may be cheating that I post pictures from inside the dome since you have to pay to go inside,  but if you don't get a chance to go to Singapore and see this you should have a chance to see what you're missing. 

After all the photos I'm posting I think you'll want to make the trip.",5/2/2020,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,"What a work of architectural-nature-artistic elegance! This is worth the $23-28SGD or so entrance fee, and I opted to pay for entrance to the Flower Dome as well, so best in a bundle. 

This dome is beautiful and is perfect for a cool off break from the hot humid Singapore weather. You feel it first as you walk in and observe the fresh huge indoor waterfall. It is cooling, plus there is air conditioning, so if you need I would recommend bringing a light jacket or shawl. The temperature is at least under 20 degrees Celsius I would say.

As you hike up and around the center hill/waterfall you are able to see the various types of plants and species that you would find high up in the canopy of the world's tallest trees. It was really unique and the layout kept you in awe the whole time. There is also a portion which highlights the stalactites and stalagmites which can be found in some caves as well. This is a definite highlight for travelers near and far, really unique and I can't say if there is anything in the world like this!",12/3/2018,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,"By far one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen. I couldn't recommend it more to visitors. It is a little pricey, but completely worth it! They also have a cloud pathway in which you take an elevator to the very top and then walk down a pathway that circles around the mountain of plants and flowers. It is absolutely stunning. I would recommend not going after 5 PM, it gets extremely busy and the line to go in was very long. Initially we bought our tickets online, but there was a mixup and had to repurchase them there, so I would recommend just buying it there.",3/1/2020,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,"If you come to Singapore this is a must see. Usually botanical gardens would not top my list but this took my breath away! Honestly, it's like walking through a scene from the movie Avatar. Perfectly maintained, you will state in amazement and wonder to yourself how they can possible keep up with the sheer variety and amount of plants. Sprinkle in some amazing art work that ties in perfectly to its surroundings, you might as well be walking through a fairy tale. Also, some of the best views of the skyline! Really, just gorgeous.",16/1/2020,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,"MAGNIFICENT CREATION. so glad I chose to go here instead of the flower dome. I was being a cheapo and didn't want to spend $28 on two conservatories so I just bought a ticket for one conservatory. The cloud forest had lots of plants and trees that didn't interest me at all. But the waterfall and the walkways were mind blowing. 

Once I pulled open that heavy door to the conservatory, a coolness draped over me. The temperature made everything so much more realistic. The waterfall was right by the door and I couldn't believe that I was staring at world's tallest indoor waterfall. Needless to say, it was a mesmerizing sight. There were a lot of tourists taking pictures in front of it but with a distance. I was wondering why. So I went as near to it as I could for my picture and it was then that I understood why. The water splashes and it literally felt like I was taking a shower under it. Call me crazy but I actually really enjoyed that LOL. 

The cloud walk and treetop walk were basically ""bridges"" that went semi around the conservatory. It felt like a death defying experience for me because I could've had a heart attack. I tried my best to walk right in the middle cause the sides didn't feel as sturdy but a lot of people were stopping to take pics and whatnot. There was even a little balcony on one floor. I don't understand why but the balcony HAD HOLES ON THE FLOOR. Like why?! 

Anyway it was a surreal experience with great views. This is a must for if you go to Singapore!",5/2/2018,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,"First time coming here, and I was completely blown away!!
Came in early on a week day to beat the crowd, it was amazing being in here. Absolutely beautiful, it's nice and chill thanks to the AC, so it works as a great escape from the heat. Walking around you'll notice dragon statues hidden throughout the place.
Take the elevator up to the skywalk for better views, including a cool view of the Marina Bay sands. As you walk through the different levels they have displays and presentations about global warming and climate change.
I highly recommend coming here, I left this place blown away at it's beauty, and wanting to plant some trees.",7/12/2019,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,"In the end it's a botanic garden but way bigger and more impressive than everything I have seen up to now. There is a huge hollow mountain in the middle of the dome from which water is falling down and you can feel the spray. On a hot day, this is definitely a cool down. You can take the stairs, or if you aren't too much into walking, the elevator to reach the top and then walk down the trail. In our case it was a little bit too crowded kills the experience a little. Never the less, you can see a lot nature, some great wooden carvings and in the end you learn a little about global warming (it's not annoying, but can cause remorse when you are not treating mother earth as she deserves it)
Comparing both domes (flower and this) I would choose this over the other.
Both are great architectural buildings but this one has the more interesting content.",10/1/2017,Arts

While the flower dome is awesome - this one is more spectacular with the vertical waterfall and high arch skywalks. Upon walking in, you can immediately feel the cool relief from the blistering humidity. You'll follow the path that eventually winds up to the top of the dome where you'll be rewarded with a grand view. Walking back down along the windy skywalks is breathtaking.

Cloud Forest,5,"Cloud Forest is an amazing and unique experience. I'm usually bored by botanical gardens and conservatories, but this one was special. It really feels like Jurassic Park.

Cloud Forest,5,"This is one of the domes in the botanical gardens and definitely worth the visit! You can get a combined ticket for both this and the flower dome (about 20 US) or you can buy individual tickets. 

We didn't have a lot of time so we chose to visit only the cloud dome and I'm so glad we at least made time for this one. The waterfall that cascades down from the misty heights is 35 m tall and the world's tallest indoor waterfall. 

When you first walk in the dome, the towering misty mountain transport you into another world. The lush vegetation is stunning and I love how they've added structures and statues to make it look like a forgotten world. There are several stories to go up so that you can see the dome at different heights. There is a really pretty Lilly pond at the top and a lot of fun interactive learning features to check out as you make your way back down to the bottom.

I think they had an episode on the Magic School Bus show about this as well). So much to see. It was just beautiful, and at times, quite tranquil to walk around this forest. It was a visual and sensory experience. The best thing about it was the air conditioning provided in this indoor greenhouse forest. This was much appreciated what when the consistent temperature in Singapore was usually more than 90 degrees F. This is a must do on your list if you come to Singapore. The ticket for Cloud Forest also includes access to their other exhibit, the Flower Dome. So, that was cool. They also have mist shows here at different times of the day.

We walked closer to the waterfall as soon as we saw it and felt the mist on our skin. I think families with kids will definitely enjoy this attraction and the green lush vegetation was very easy to the eyes.

Cloud Forest,5,"I didn't get to check this place out the last time I was in Singapore, so I made it a priority to come here this time, and I must admit that it was well worth the visit. Basically it is an indoor eco-system, with an artificial mountain that is coverved with tropical trees. You can go to the top of the mountain where there are walkways that wind their way down, and they even spray mist to give the impression of a, well, a cloud forest. The basement level consists namely of ecological information pertaining to climate change, and also how they keep this place running through the use of resusable energy and recycled water.

I enjoyed strolling around and looking at all the different things they had in there, all the flowers and woodworks/carvings. They had some flowers and other things made out of all legos which I thought were pretty cool. Just amazing. A great way to spend an hour or so. Take in the beautiful work they've put into this place.",18/3/2018,Arts
Cloud Forest,3,"The most important detail? Air conditioned. Or at least, cool, if not also pretty moist/humid. But certainly refreshing after the outside. But for that exact reason, it was a mob scene on a random Tuesday night. The standard people taking selfies and blocking the path and basically just being ignorant of everyone else around them, which drives me nuts.

That aside, this is a pretty cool display. Really cool structure, with some great views of things, both inside an out. I particularly loved the ""top floor"" display of carniverous plants (pitcher plants, Venus fly traps, etc) mixed with Lego versions of the same. Not sure if this is permanent or not, but it was cool.

Also, I know this is not a botanical garden - Singapore has one of those, and it's not Gardens by the Bay - but I do think they could do a better job presenting information on what you're seeing. Information is kind of sparse, and I would have spent more time here and enjoyed it more had there been more information on what I was seeing, more stuff about the ecosystem being represented, and so on. That omission is what keeps me from raving about this.

Of the two (Cloud Forest and Flower Dome) I would say this is the one that's more worth visiting - It's more interesting to me, although maybe without the variety of Flower Dome. But frankly, both are pretty reasonable to get in to, so I wouldn't turn people away from either.",12/10/2017,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,"Expensive but worth it.  It was absolutely breath taking.  The views are incredible.  I wish I'd had more time, or had taken the guided to tour to really be able to appreciate all of the different plants on display.  If I'm able to make it back to SIN I'll spring the extra for the tour.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.",21/12/2017,Arts

It is unlike anything I have ever seen!",26/6/2017,Arts
Cloud Forest,5,I really enjoyed the Cloud Forest. Very educational as well as visually impressive. The walkways give you phenomenal points of view.

CE LA VI,5,"The nighttime city views are breathtaking. Ce La Vi is at the top of Marina Bay Sands, right next to the infinity pool (you must be a hotel guest to access the pool). We made a reservation for ladies' night, which is Wednesday night in Singapore. The club lounge is more of a lounge and not a club as everyone was sitting around, and there was no dancing. There is also a restaurant, which requires a separate reservation.

The reservation is free to make, so you only pay for the drinks you order, which are very expensive but worth it for the views. The SkyPark costs $26 for admission, so it's a much better deal just to go to Ce La Vi to get the city views, which are a lot prettier at night. The cocktails are $25, and there is a special deal on ladies' night for $18 glasses of prosecco, white wine, and red wine.",22/2/2023,Food & Beverage
CE LA VI,3,"Located at the top of Marina Bay Sands, the Club Lounge offers amazing views over the city. But that's pretty much all you can expect. Instead of a fun vibe, the music and the service fell short and we left earlier than anticipated. Dress attire is dressy/casual smart! 

We didn't make any reservations and walked-in with no problem. At the first floor, there's a little counter where people line up and pay for cover. Each entry ticket comes with a drink and you would think that would be enough to make it worth it but more on that later. Elevators take you all the way to the top and the first thing you're greeted with is the dance floor. 

After walking around and taking pictures of the view, we redeemed our drinks. The service was unbelievably cold. Barely a word spoken and everybody just looked annoyed. The drinks were also so weak. I ordered a pineapple and vodka and it tasted like watered down pineapple juice. 

I think this place has a lot of potential. The space is nice, the views are amazing, but there was nothing else to keep us there. The music that day was too monotonous and no one enjoyed it. And on top of that, we couldn't hear each other over the noise so we ended up leaving within an hour to go gamble in the basement.",19/2/2023,Food & Beverage
CE LA VI,2,You really pay for the view. Unfortunately the food was not good. As a matter of fact the waiter forgot to put our dinner order in until we asked. He apologized. But prob should not have even ordered. Very pricey for mediocre food.  But love the marina bay sands hotel.,29/5/2023,Food & Beverage
CE LA VI,3,"The view was great but the vibe was off. I think overall it is worth checking out, because you can see the whole city and some very notable sites.

The venue itself was underwhelming. You check in on the first floor, and they wouldn't let someone in our group up because they were wearing shorts (male). However, when we got up, after paying the $38pp cover, we saw many people dressed very casually. I mean, athletic clothes, running shorts for women, tennis shoes, suitcases and backpacks. The club is next to the hotel pool, where many people are swimming and lounging.

The DJ was playing the most generic music so no one was dancing. The bar was understaffed, and the ""free drink"" voucher that comes with the cover charge does not include cocktails.

There were open tables, and we asked one of the waitresses if we could sit without ordering, and she said yes. That was really nice -- we got to sit there for about 30 minutes until the reservation came.",26/1/2023,Food & Beverage
CE LA VI,5,"First time at ce la vi in Singapore, hard not to compare it to the one in dubai. This place was stunning. So many people come here to get a glimpse of the city from all the way up and this place did not disappoint. They had a great variety of cocktails, mock tails, food, soft drinks wine whatever you needed. The views were breathtaking here. I was lucky enough to make some friends with some of the employees, we were invited to a lot of their events during our stay in Singapore. They have a very very cool set up / layout here and everyone was super friendly. As you know many people do come here so definitely try and make a reservation!

CE LA VI,1,"Five years ago Ce La Vi was a solid choice, great views and somewhat mediocre cocktails for a reasonable price. Now the price is still reasonable, but the views are mediocre ( you cannot see the bay anymore), and the cocktails are atrocious.

Avoid unless you are an influencer with non traveling audience.",6/10/2024,Food & Beverage

CE LA VI,4,"This club is located on 57 floor of the Marina Bay Sand Hotel. This club is next to the hotel infinity pool. The last scene shot of the engagement party for the Crazy Rich Asian was shoot there. You can imagine synchronized swimming was there on the last scene. 

Instead paid for Skypark to access the tower, might as well paid for the drink at the CE LA VI Club. The proper way to get to the club is use the elevator at tower 3. Which northern tower. The elevator will make the ear pop due to high speed elevator. 

The view at night is spectacular. The night skyline for the city is light up very beautiful. It is breathtaking view while you sit and sip. I got the Singapore Sling. It is must have drink in Singapore and only at Singapore. It is good mixture of cocktail. The glass look big.",3/3/2019,Food & Beverage

You get to go to the 57th floor instead of just the 56th and you can see the giant infinity pool! You can also see out from both sides of the hotel. It was definitely worth it!

CE LA VI,1,"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. I have never experienced such blatant racism anywhere.

We paid $35 per person just to enter this so-called ""club lounge,"" and that credit could be used toward food--but what's the point if they refuse to serve you? We waited a good 30 minutes, and not a single server came to us. I had to start flagging them down, and even then, two servers brushed me off, saying they'd come back but never did. When I finally got a third server's attention, I was told they don't serve food in the area we were sitting in. That was a lie.

Less than a foot away, a white couple was getting full service, with a server coming up to them to ask if they wanted to order more food. At the same time, another server was bringing food to the white couple sitting behind us. It was so bad that the white couple next to us even offered to order food for us because they saw what was happening.

And here's the kicker: the servers who ignored us were Asian themselves. They deliberately chose to serve white and Japanese guests while refusing to serve us. This wasn't bad service--this was outright discrimination.

If you're not white or Japanese, don't waste your time or money here. They will take your entrance fee but won't treat you like a valued customer. Absolutely disgusting behavior.",23/2/2025,Food & Beverage
CE LA VI,3,"If you want the Marina Bay Sands rooftop view without staying at the hotel, this is the next best thing. There is a $30 entrance fee, but it does go to anything you purchase at the bar for drinks or food. Luckily I was a hotel guest, so it's free but my friend who was visiting had to pay. Esssentially, it just means you need to buy a drink.

Once upstairs and you go inside, it's got a lounge feel. All the tables had a reserved sign and there wasn't much direction where to go. Eventually, we asked an employee and they told us we could sit at a table, but had to leave once the reserved party came. As we sat there, no one came to help us either. When we went to the bar to order drinks, they told us someone should've helped us. I'm not sure what was going on, but we finally ordered our Singapore Slings (SG$25). The drinks are pretty, the view is pretty, it's worth the experience.

Since I was staying at MBS, this spot didn't appeal to me as the view from the pool is even better. So yes if you're just visiting, but that's all.",3/12/2023,Food & Beverage
CE LA VI,5,What can I say. This is the lounge on the top of marine bay sands where everyone hope to get a seat next to the edge so that they can get a shot with the beautiful Singapore skyline. Enjoy the video and take the obvious 5/5 review.,19/12/2024,Food & Beverage
CE LA VI,5,"Came here specifically to catch some views at the famous Marina Bay Sands with a fancy drink in hand. Since I didn't want to pay extra to go on the sky deck, I thought to come here where you pay $30 entrance fee but you get to redeem them for drinks and food.  I wanted to try their Singapore Sling and it was delicious and refreshing.  We also tried their impossible kimchi burger and very tasty! We arrived on a Fri at 4:30 to beat the crowds because it will get packed. unfortunately, it was a cloudy day so the views were not spectacular, however, if you can stay till sunset, they are amazing as everyone will agree. but don't fret, when you leave and walk towards Gardens by the Bay, you'll still be able to see the evening skyline and it's just gorgeous and romantic.

CE LA VI,3,"This bar is a cool way to see Singapore from above, we went pre sunset and had to pay a cover charge downstairs for $30 which credits back to your drink purchases. I thought the drinks were fine nothing too different from your standard bar. There are many high tops but it can get crowded pretty easily so i suggest going early if you want to get a seat at the edge for clear views. A little after 5pm the DJ was setting up and playing some tunes, nothing too loud during the time we were there.",27/9/2023,Food & Beverage
CE LA VI,5,"If you are looking for a rooftop club/lounge with stunning views of Singapore, look no further. Cé La Vie is located on top of Marina Bay Sands and has the best views all around.

You pay $20 to go up but can use it to pay for dinner/drinks. The drinks are pricey, and so is the cover, but it's worth it to spend the night mesmerizing over the skyline at night. Amazing roof-top setup; but usually gets crowded especially during the night, so try going there a little early in the evening. You have an unrestricted 180-degree view of the city and the Marina-bay right in the front! Its a touristy place but the crowd is great, the food is decent and the service was satisfactory.

If you're not staying at Marina Bay, Book in advance for a good table at the edge. Overall definitely a worthwhile experience!",19/12/2018,Food & Beverage

I went there at 9:45 pm and they close at 11 pm. We had to pay $35 each to get in, however that did fo towards anything we purchased. When we got there it was a private party going on. There was limited seats. All the tables that were left had reservation signs. They advised we could sit there but would have to leave of the party came
So we asked how can we reserve a table
They said minimum of $200 per person. So that tells me that all the tables were not reserved. When paying to get in they should of advised there was a private party and no seating is available. Who is going to order drinks and food to have to get up if a party comes that reserves a table after we order. I would never stand up to eat. I would NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. 0 STARS",9/5/2024,Food & Beverage

We had great service from Chris from Malaysia who also gave us guidance as to local Hawker Centers for local food.

Had two drinks, Singapore Chili Crab Pizza (No Crab Shells, just Crab Meat) and Fried Salted Egg Shrimp.  Unique local blend of East and West.  Pricey but what do you expect from a venue overlooking Singapore.",4/11/2018,Food & Beverage

CE LA VI,3,"I'm honestly pretty disappointed with my visit here. We were hoping to head to the restaurant and enjoy a meal, but unfortunately it was all booked so we opted for the lounge instead. There was a $20 entrance fee but those funds can be applied as a voucher for food and drinks, so that's much nicer than paying $20 just to visit the skypark. The voucher only lets you in to the lounge and restaurant areas, so you can't actually go to the skypark but you still get the incredible view. The view is amazing. You can see so much of Singapore from the 57th floor. I just wish that the experience at the lounge could have been better. They let way too many people up considering that they had half of the seating blocked off and covered. The result? Nearly everyone was stuck standing and it was extremely crowded. It was very difficult to walk. 

The food was mediocre. Definitely not worth the money. The chicken satay reminded me more of kabob that anything else, and the korean chicken wings honestly did not taste good at all. They had a strange flavor and they were very spicy. The squid was okay, definitely not the worst calamari I've ever had. 

The service is slow as waiters are hard to find. If you come here, I recommend grabbing a drink instead of a bite to eat.",27/6/2018,Food & Beverage

I can't believe that this restaurant lounge has only three stars because we receive such a great service and the view is amazing. Yes, even though the prices were very expensive, I think it was worth it for our honeymoon. It was hard to get a good view of the city with the sky observation deck open but thankfully they closed the deck for a private event so we were able to get a really nice view after all.

CE LA VI,2,Great views but the drinks are horrible. The pro tip here is use the $22 voucher on beers. All of the mixed drinks are not crafted with care and they are heavily watered down. What's spectacular is the cityview - especially at night. It's definitely better on the lounge side where you have unhinder outlook to the city (barside has the sky deck below). Though both sides will have smoking tables so you'll likely get wafts of cigarettes smoke unless the wind is going strong.,9/5/2019,Food & Beverage
CE LA VI,3,"$20 entrance fee to the Sky Deck Club Lounge. Pricey but it goes towards your food and drink bill. Seems like a good deal, but it also forces you to buy something to ""redeem"" your $20.

If you're coming for the city view, be prepared to be disappointed. The best view is at the observatory, one floor below. You can see everyone enjoying the view from the observatory level. 

Imagine the lounge as the balcony of the observatory. You get a glimpse of the view, but you're not close enough to see it well. You also have to fight for a standing table.

CE LA VI,4,"Pretty cool club with awesome view at the top of Marina Bay Sands, I came up here for a drink, instead of going right for a bar, staff there asked if I wanted to go to the club side so we did.

Not sure there was a cover charge or not but they stamped something on my arm at the door. 

Service was great, friendly and fast, they let us sit at the reserved table so we can comfortably sit.

They had members only area in the back near the famous pool, I asked but after too few many drinks I can't remember what they said.

Bathroom is located one floor down, clean but I was super careful walking down the stairs.

I am not really a night club type person, in fact last time I stepped inside a night club was just about four years ago in Jakarta Indonesia, so I really don't have anything to compare to if this was good or not but with this view, it's so worth going up here at least once.

Once I was there the staff was friendly and accommodating and although the view was amazing, I really didn't like the outside seating because Singapore's weather is humid. However, it's not their fault. Also, they only had Ciroc vodka, which I really don't like.

CE LA VI,4,"Instead of paying $23 to go up to the SkyPark, we opted to visit Ce La Vi for drinks. It was night time and we got up to the ticket counter at exactly 9:00pm, expecting there to be a cover. Oddly, we were told that there was no cover after 9:00pm to go up to the 57th floor. Before 9pm, it was $20, which could be applied toward drink purchases.

Once we got up, we walked around the bar area, which is connected to the restaurant. The view is not bad but you can't get to the edge of the building as that section is blocked off as an extension of the SkyPark.

We walked around to the other side of the floor and found the club lounge. It was more lively with a DJ playing (repetitive) Latin music. The four of us found a small table and ordered drinks, which cost ~$22 each on average. The club lounge was adjacent to the Infinity Pool, which is worth a look. This is the closest you'll be able to get to it unless you are a hotel guest.

All in all, Ce La Vi was a good way to see Singapore. For the same price as SkyPark admission, we were able to enjoy a drink and see the pool.",26/3/2018,Food & Beverage
CE LA VI,4,"Honestly, I get it, it's a bit of a tourist trap. That said, it beats the sky park because you get a drink as and can lounge about. I was unsure if it would be worth the time and money but the view was surreal and that memory alone made it worth it",22/3/2020,Food & Beverage

AT $38 Per pax, without a drink. It's really pricey and catered towards tourists. Do note selfie sticks are not allowed. The security will come over and confiscate it from you! It's kind of breezy, so you don't have to worry about it being too hot, since it's not an indoor and air-conditioned club.

There's basically just standing area along the perimeter of the club. All the sofa and tables are for reservation only, as per usual club norms. The music seemed to be catered towards a more matured crowd and I grew bored of it instantly.

I recommend hitting the bar up on a weekday or Sunday around 5 or 6 so you can actually get a table next to the railing. Don't forget, there are 2 sides to this bar (a lounge side and a bar side), so don't get stressed if the lounge side is full.

If you just want to go visit you have to buy a voucher if $22 sg dollars. You can redeem that for either food or drink. But one thing to know $22 sg would only buy a glass of whiskey, rum, vodka.... no cocktails are covered. I had to pay extra $6 sg on top of the voucher to buy a mojito, which was really needed in the hot humid weather of Singapore. The drink was balanced not too strong or watered down, couldn't really taste the mint much. But yeah was a disappointment in quality coming from a five star place...after that I opted to not waste anymore money on any drink. It's important to know Singapore levies more taxes on alcohol so it's going to be pricier. Overall definitely a tourist attraction the rooftop is nice and all but does not have amazing view as the hotel itself is a thing to look at. Except the water show which is a nice addition.

I asked him ""so is there a surcharge"" and then he answers ""if you buy something at $225 then you pay the difference."" The voucher is $20. So I have to order things $18 or $16 and he didn't help me with. Simple experience.

CE LA VI,3,"If you're at Marina Bay Sands in the evening, you want to see views of Singapore, everyone in your party is over the age of 18, you're smartly dressed, and you have a choice between the Sands SkyPark and Ku De Ta, CHOOSE KU TE DA.

I say this because Ku Te Da is one floor higher than the SkyPark, offers the same view, and if you come before they start charging cover (which is after 9 PM on Fridays and the weekend) then you can basically get the view for free (or at least have an alcoholic beverage to go with it.) If you come later on the weekend and do pay the $38 cover, it should come with a drink. 

I've been here twice, as a tourist and to bring other tourists, and it's been okay. Both times I was there before midnight, so the DJ was playing hits from 2007 (Timbaland/Nelly Furtado's ""Give it to me"" is a good example) and no one was utilizing the small dance floor. If you're patient, you can snag a spot by the cocktail tables along the perimeter and take a few good pictures.

Because of the outdated music, cover charge, and older/tourist crowd, I file this place under ""Singapore Tour Guide destination / Good to say you've been once"". But hey, at least it gives you the opportunity to scream ""I'm on a boat, bitch!"" ala The Lonely Island. :)",23/4/2013,Food & Beverage

Expensive cocktails, but worth the price of admission. Stunning panoramic views of the city and marina bay. You get a feeling that you're at the top of the world as you sip your (very overpriced) cocktail, standing by the glass pane on the edge of the lounge. 

There was a decently sized section for dancing, but perhaps Singaporeans are a bit shy on non-partying days. We came here on a Sunday night, and most people stayed far away from that section, preferring the outside part while chatting up friends much more.

Mixed crowd of locals and foreigners, young and older.  VIP area and tables with bottle service like a typical Hollywood club.

DJ's were alright and got progressively better later through the night.  Dance floor is kind of small but adequate for the crowd.

No but really, I came on a Friday early into the night, paid $30 pp cover charge per person, although it was more of a voucher where you could use that ticket value towards a drink.
Drinks are 35+ so you still have to shell out some extra cash based on what you order. Ridiculous greater than NY prices, but the view is spectacular and the experience is even better with good company. 

They do have a closed off lounge area, ie $2-3000 for bottle service and your very own table!

Then you are hand-picked by the rude hostesses to enter, a bit like how someone hand picks meat at a supermarket.  And when you are inside you are subjected to treatment as if you are a diseased dog... needless to say drinks prices are a total rip-off!

CE LA VI,4,"I've visited KDT several times - and it's because of the spectacular vantage point.

Here, it's all about the views you get perched atop the Marina Bay Sands, feeling slightly glorious with the wind in your hair as you survey the Singapore CBD skyline.  The MBS is a little set aside from the the rest of the CBD, which means that it's an excellent spot to scope out both the older Raffles Place CBD and the Marina Bay Financial Centre.  It's a different perspective compared to some other rooftop bars which are nestled in the CBD, and thus don't offer that panoramic view.

Besides the views, the other factors here are adequate-to-good.  Decent cocktail and drinks list.  Bar snacks are limited.  Crowded.  Unless there's a special event on, music is not spectacular.  Staff try to help, but seem perpetually a bit overwhelmed by the crowds.  On the pricey side, over S$20 for a cocktail.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,5,"We stayed at the JW for 3 nights during our trip to Singapore and I have to say everything from our room to the hotel amenities are fantastic! We were lucky to be upgraded to a junior suite corner room which to our surprise was huge with a separate living room and 1.5 baths. I loved the layout of the bathroom and the 2 walls of large windows in our corner room bedroom! 

The Executive Lounge is fantastic with breakfast, afternoon tea and hors 'doeuvres daily. The breakfast has a made-to-order omelette and noodle soup bar and rotates the dishes enough that it doesn't get boring eating in the lounge every morning. 

There's also 2 pools which provide nice views of the city (in particular the pool on the 18th floor). They were a bit cold to swim in but I saw plenty of people relaxing around and in the gym in the mornings. 

As an additional note, we mentioned we were staying in Singapore as a part of our honeymoon trip and being Ambassador Elite members, we received a $100 credit towards Marriott activities and tours for our stay from the hotel. This was the first and only time I've received such a nice gift and I was really blown away by the staff here.",30/11/2022,Hotels

There was a long line when we went to check-out so a staff member just collected our room keys and asked for the room we were checking out of and I received my invoice via email. 

Our reservation didn't have access to breakfast, and we didn't have time to use the pool, but both looked nice if we had another chance to stay here.

As a Lifetime Titanium member with Bonvoy, I was ""upgraded"" to a higher floor room. Unfortunately, the view was lackluster at best.  There was a large overhang sort of thing like an atrium, and so the city view was quite obscured.  Disappointed with the ""upgrade"" but whatever. I've had much nicer upgrades because of my status with other international Marriotts so ymmv. 

The highlight of the hotel is the excellent Executive Lounge. Breakfast and evening selections were numerous and very tasty.  Both Western and Asian foods were available, and service from the dining room attendants was fantastic.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,1,"EDIT: My previous review remains below, however I will say that this Marriott property ""loyalty and guest services manager"" reached out and apologized that we were unsatisfied with the room, and that she would attempt to find another equivalent room at a higher floor. In the morning we were made aware that our new room was made available, I was a little bit confused as I hadn't made a request to move rooms, nor made aware of any of the details of the move. We were just told to pack, they'd move the luggage, and give us the new keys. Upon arrival, we both immediately noticed that the room was significantly smaller. Like 15-20% smaller, and that's being conservative. At this point I'm a little bit frustrated that we moved from a room with a bad view, to a tiny room with a different view, just 3 floors higher. We then received an email that our room was DOWNGRADED to a deluxe room in order to get a higher floor, with only a $47 compensation for the remainder of the days. What the heck?! That barely covers a single burger off the room service menu here. Following that, we complained and requested an equivalent room rather than a downgrade. This is where the great tour of the JW Marriott occurred. We were then moved to floor 8, where upon entering the third room we were offered, I noticed a very murky almost 'wet-dog' smell. Upon further inspection, I found a lot of stains in the carpet that I assume was either blood or feces. Off the side of the bathtub, there was actual fecal matter--showing the quality of housekeeping in this property. At this point I was exceptionally irritated by the search to find an acceptable room. Fourth time, the manager we were working with personally inspected the room, it was the cleanest of the rooms, but still had what I can only assume is bed bugs ingrained in the carpet. And the AC does not function at all in the last room. We gave up trying after running around, packing and unpacking our belongings over the span of 4 hours --which would've better been spent exploring Singapore instead of wasting our time finding an acceptable room. The only offer we received for the inconvenience was 10,000 Marriott points ($100 US value), up from 7000 points offered after making the staff aware of the state of the third room.

One thing that really irked me is the fact that the loyalty and guest services manager downgraded our room from premier to deluxe, despite having 2 more 'equivalent' premier rooms available immediately, and without my knowledge nor consent. A real 'punch to the face' if you will.


--Old Review--
Very new property. The whole hotel gives me a bit of a grand and fancy property vibe with the esplanade train connection and number of good restaurants on the basement floor. This hotel has a 5-star location, with 5-star equivalent surrounding amenities, and a 5-star hotel exterior design.

The lobby is however very narrow making it prone to traffic jams, the service at the front desk is quite slow. I think the front desk might've not appreciated my late arrival due to an almost 2.5 hour flight delay - because I was placed in a room below the roof line, where pool-goers have a direct line of sight into my room. This is also with a status that supposedly guarantees a room upgrade when available, but for whatever reason we got no upgrade. Every single person I've ridden the elevator up with has been placed on a high floor, except me. Strange. The service staff lacks the warmth and welcome that others are trained to never slack on--After staying at multiple high end hotels (Conrad, Shangrila, Aman, Ritz, etc) I can positively say that JW lacks everything in the hospitality and service that higher end hotels offer. Just as an example--when arriving at the Ritz just down the street we were given a warm welcome and a tour of the facilities, and the were made aware of all of the hotels exits. The only 'welcome' we got was from a staff member who said 'Merry Christmas, by the way the wifi is out - so if you want food, write it down on a sheet of paper'. Yikes. The minibar and room service is horrendously overpriced--even compared to the ritz, the included amenities are very cheap. I noticed there's even paint peeling inside of my room. On the second day I noticed room service hadn't set the bed properly, so the fitted sheet was just laying on top of the bed. The shower drain is absolutely caked in mold/mildew so I have no doubt that they never clean the area properly as well. There's just so many details that make me believe this isn't worthy of a 5 star rating.",28/12/2022,Hotels
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,4,"Spent 4 days here while visiting our granddaughter. We stayed in their family room which has a king-sized bed, as well as a queen-sized sofa bed, which was perfect for a party of 4 with a baby. The check in process was seamless. We requested for a crib and was surprised to see a pouch of baby toiletries, that we didn't ask for. That's Marriott going above and beyond. Unfortunately, we didn't get the side pillows of the crib that we requested from housekeeping who came for our turn down service. I don't know if it was communication barrier. She did have a phone with a translator. Otherwise, the service was excellent. We had access to the Executive Lounge and that did not disappoint. They have a different theme everyday. The 2 days we accessed it, they had Korean and then Japanese. I especially love the noodle counter. They have a good variety of food, from cheeses to gravlox to cold cuts, salads, fruits and pastries. noodle and several main dishes everyday. That is breakfast, afternoon tea, hors d'oeuvres, and evening cocktails. The staff here are very attentive and accommodating. I have to mention, Hazel, who made sure to make us feel at home. Special thanks to Gabriel who gave us wonderful restaurant recommendations. Both were from the Executive Lounge.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,5,"I'm halfway through my stay here at this Marriott property and I felt compelled to write a review even before the end of my stay because I felt so strongly about the quality of my stay so far.

I arrived after midnight and was immediately greeted at the door by an employee who helped unload my bag out of the taxi and physically walked me to the front desk. I had been flying for the past 24 hours and took 3 separate planes to get here, normally I would take care of myself but it was all I could do was drag myself behind him to check in.

The team at the front desk was cordial, helpful and fast with getting me what I needed to get upstairs as quickly as possible. I travel frequently for work so I have status with Marriott. It allowed me to request an upgrade from my standard room with two twin beds into a corner suite that essentially is about as large as my 2B2B condominium in Chicago. The views are pretty sweet- I'm looking at the famous Raffles hotel and there's even 1.5 bathrooms for me. I'm sure if I had more than one person staying in here we would have use for the main living area as well as the extra half bathroom but I'm not someone who would need any of this.

The bathroom has a full tub and shower with multiple spray options for those who like to take their time getting ready in the morning.

With my status comes access to the Executive Lounge- where there is a daily buffet from 6-10:30 for breakfast, which has just about everything you can think of- very eclectic so there's something for everyone. Local flavors, classic N American style meats, fruits and charcuterie and smoked salmon. Bread, cereal, omelette/egg stations round out your choices. Tough not to overeat and breakfast isn't generally something I usually indulge in. 

They offer afternoon tea service daily from 2:30-5, and hors d'oeuvres from 5:30-7:30 (along with cocktails from 5:30-9:30. The small items they advertise are basically good enough to substitute for dinner. Today they had the bread, salad, fruit station, warm bao with BBQ meat, charcuterie and small bites like burrata with diced tomatoes and basil strips served in shot glasses, and fried shrimp, veggie rolls, and other stuff that anyone can find something to satisfy their desires. 

Also there's  a dessert table with various local delicacies, tarts, and you could hit up the fruit station if you're still hungry. I had a chance to speak 
with Chef Arjun about how great my experience with the lounge food has been, from trying local dishes to various items from the mix of cultures that visit or have immigrated to Singapore. I especially noted to Arjun how much I appreciated the authenticity of the dishes- I tried curried potatoes as a side for breakfast and it was nothing I was accustomed to. He asked if I would be back tomorrow for the cocktail hour because he wanted to prepare something special for me. I'm unfortunately going to be on a bus tour tomorrow night but I'm looking forward to Monday's event just because nobody has ever offered something like this before and it was definitely flattering.

If you need to get local currency, the front desk can accommodate you. I'm sure the concierge can hook you up with whatever you're looking to do here. The hotel is pretty much going to come through wherever, and whenever you need something. 

We are above an MRT station, there's plenty of restaurants and beverage options nearby and you can get anywhere you need to easily. On the recommendation of the front desk associate upon checking in, I downloaded the App: Grab, which is like Uber, Grubhub, Expedia and Ticketmaster all mashed up in one. You can get a car or taxi ride for cheaper than flagging one down. 

I've got just about three nights left, and I am going to enjoy the rest of my stay before flying home to Chicago. 

If you have a chance to pick where you're planning on staying I suggest you consider this property. Newer building, impeccable service, and great location. I'm coming back for certain. And I'll stay longer than five nights so I can adjust to the time change much easier than this past trip. 

Before I leave I'm going to eat at Akira Back's place and treat myself to a fantastic last meal for this visit.

The bathroom water pressure was weak and the temperature for the water took a very long time to get hot. One plus was the AC was very good.

While some of the staff was friendly and helpful the woman who checked me in was cold and a bit off-putting especially when I asked for an upgraded room as a Gold member (No) and a room on a higher floor (No).  When I asked about the standard 2pm late check-out, again a perk for Gold members, she acted like it was some great act of kindness on her part to perhaps allow this.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,5,"We were here about a year ago and decided to stay here again.  It was the perfect location. It's near two malls, a train station and has views of the ocean. 

As a Marriott Titanium member, we were surprised to be upgraded from a regular room to a premier Marina Bay view suite, without using an upgrade voucher.  WOW! 

The food at the lounge was very good, especially the desserts.  They even had a dessert I ordered at Madame Fan, one of their restaurants. 

The staff were all very friendly and helpful. 

We have to stay here again on our next Singapore trip.",26/4/2024,Hotels

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,5,"Wow. All JW Marriott's need to learn from this hotel. Beautiful, clean hotel and excellent service. They are better than other luxury resorts we've stayed at around the world. 
Perfect location. You can get anywhere from the Esplanade MRT station under the hotel. When getting to hotel, go to Exit F (South Beach). 
We were on the 19th floor and had an awesome view of the Marina Bay. We could see the light show at night. 
Service is super friendly. They helped us with directions and gave us tip on where to eat. 
House keeping was excellent. Rooms super clean and modern. They provided lots of water bottles, and replenish them constantly. 
When leaving, they reserved a taxi for us and it was waiting for us at 0600 right when we checked out. Taxi was $36 to airport. We would definitely stay here again when visiting Singapore.",30/3/2024,Hotels

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,5,"I had the pleasure of staying at the JW Marriott South Beach for two nights on a long layover in Singapore. It's a bit pricey for a Marriott, but in this case you are paying for the location and excellent service. 

Check in was a breeze. I was walked to my room in the East tower, as it took several elevators to get there. The room was spacious with a great view and luxurious bathroom. The room was supplied with a robe and slippers, and every travel toiletry imaginable. Toothbrush/paste, mouthwash,  cotton swabs, etc. 

Service was great, room was clean and comfortable. It's quite hot in Singapore so I was grateful for good air conditioning. 

My only complaint is that you have to be Marriott Platinum in order to receive breakfast. I would have loved to try their breakfast buffet, but I was not spending $45 to try it when there were plenty of delicious breakfast spots in the area. 

The area is very safe and walkable, I was able to walk to Chinatown, Arab St, Gardens by the Bay, and many malls and restaurants from this location.",7/3/2024,Hotels

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,5,"We ended up at the JW after our tour company failed us by booking us into the smallest hotel room at another local hotel. My husband cashed in his Marriott points and we ended up here for three nights.

Upon entering the hotel it was beautiful and full of life and class. Our room was upgraded and included a tub, shower, toilet (with fancy things on it to include a butt warmer and bidet), robes, slippers, TV, high-speed wifi, etc. 

The hotel had a full gym to include ellipticals, treadmills, free weights, weight machines, BOB for boxing and kickboxing, stair steppers, etc. Each machine had access to water, towels, and hook ups for phones. The hotel also on the same floor had a pool and a lounge area for reading and or relaxing with a view.

We had a free upgrade to the executive lounge. This allowed access to a full breakfast (fresh coffee that is grounded for my pleasure), appetizers, free alcohol, and tons of eats. One of my favorites was getting something from the chef and smoked salmon. Since Singapore is on the expensive side for booze it was a pleasant surprise to enjoy free drinks ranging from Tiger beer on draft, wines, spirits, and if you are lucky the staff will make your drinks to include the famous Singapore Sling.",14/7/2017,Hotels

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,5,"Wonderful hotel in terms of hotel itself and services. The decor is very modern and chic (think The Cosmopolitan in Vegas) and things are very organized and clean.  

We had a suite as part of a Marriott awards upgrade and had some issues with the ceiling due to the heavy rains. The staff immediately jumped on this and moved us to a comparable room (although it was a city view vs the great marina view) but offered us some credits into our account for our trouble.

The management team was great here for check in to check out, and the concierge was very courteous and even walked out with us and waiting until our Grab arrived to take us to the airport.

One of the best parts is one of two pools on site. There is one that is covered (so protected from the elements) but still outdoor, and overlooks the Singapore skyline.  This is a must do while you stay here.

The breakfast buffet is very good at the Beach Road Kitchen.  It's not earth shattering, but a good high end hotel restaurant breakfast buffet.

First prime rib, was cut in small pieces like we were at a Korean barbecue. They use something they called a cereal crust, I have no clue what it was, but it did not taste good. out of the entire buffet, there were a few things I enjoyed, the mashed potatoes, small pork, ribs, and garlic toast. This certainly wasn't a myriad standard. And for the cost it should've been half the price. I strongly suggest if you want a night out at a good quality restaurant, you need to look past this one.",22/1/2023,Hotels

Plush, new, modern well designed, while preserving the old, without being out of place in colonial Singapore.

Awesome tall lobby, room, pool deck, infinity pool, dining hall.

Located just outside Raffles Hotel, a stone throw away from Arab St civic district, and minutes away from CBD, MBS, Gardens by the Bay.

Really fantastic looking and tasting breakfast, high-teas & great bar, manned by best local chefs.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,5,"First time in Singapore and second time at a JW Marriott: and they never disappoint. As soon as you walk in, you are greeted with smiles and friendly staff members. They then proceed on how they may assist you. 

As we were getting checked in, a different staff member came over and gave us some calamansi juice (at least that's what I believe it tasted like). Nonetheless it was refreshing. 

We then proceeded up to our rooms. They have some cool elevators there. As the light changes along the walls of the elevator, so does the design; I've never seen that before. The rooms are very modern and everything looked brand new. Tons of mirrors and lighting. A large bath tub with bath minerals. And the shower is like rainfall. Also, there's a volume control in he bathroom so that you can hear the what's on the TV. The bed was very comfortable and we slept like a baby. 

They have an infinity pool on the 18th floor, lounge, and a gym. The pool offers amazing views and is worth checking out.

All in all, my fiancée and I had an amazing experience there. The staff was always attentive and courteous. We definitely recommend staying there.",11/9/2018,Hotels
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,5,"The JW Marriott Hotel Singapore is a relatively new hotel in the new South Beach area which is across from the Suntec convention center. It's also quite close to the CBD. The JW is a modern hotel with all the amenities for a great stay. 

I took the hotel car service from Changi airport and it was punctual even with a longer than expected wait at immigration. Upon arrival I was greeted by Amanda who whisked me and my bags to my room to avoid a line at the front desk where she handled the check-in in private, which after a long flight from Tokyo was much appreciated. 

My room was bright and modern was designed for function. While not as large as many hotel rooms in which I've stayed in Singapore it never felt small. Housekeeping did an impeccable job throughout my entire stay and on the weekend turned my room when I was in the lounge for breakfast. 

The Executive Lounge at the JW was exceptional. With a wide array of eastern and western choices one was easily able to find something to eat. The breakfast service also included made to order omelettes and chicken or pork soup. The lounge had 3 food presentations daily, so very easy to grab a bite. 

I also visited Akira, the Japanese Restaurant which was also quite good, although at a slightly higher price point than the average restaurant. There are also a few good bars at the JW including 'Tonic' which is a 'must go' bar for gin lovers. I'm glad I'm coming back to the JW tomorrow as it's definitely my new go to hotel in Singapore.",21/1/2018,Hotels
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,5,"Impeccable hotel! After arriving early in Singapore from a nonstop flight out of San Francisco, the hotel accommodated my early check in with no issue - albeit I was on a low floor and did not get a king as requested. 

All the staff encountered here were friendly and willing to help. For a JW Marriott, the decor is much more trendy and modern than you'd expect. The room was small but that was a non issue - the bathroom is beautifully designed with a soaking tub, separate shower room with rain shower from the ceiling and a ""Tokyo-esque"" toilet. My only complaints were no outlets in the bathroom, and the mirrors in the room are darkly tinted which looks cool, but makes it a little hard to see yourself when getting ready. I ordered room service once during my stay, the menu was pretty limited, but the club sandwich was good.

The club lounge here is the absolute best I've experienced compared to any other Marriott with a great selection of food options, both eastern and western. There are breakfast, afternoon tea, hors d'oeuvres, and evening cocktail hours. It also has business meeting space and a computer with printer if needed. 

The spa does not post their prices online, but I emailed an appointment request and got a quick reply with a price sheet. Hotel guests also get $30 off spa treatments. I had a great treatment and enjoyed the steam room and sauna pre facial and the zero gravity relaxing chair area post facial. It was a bit pricey and they pushed their product packages at the end but it was an excellent facility - highly recommend.",6/2/2018,Hotels
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,5,"I stayed here for three nights during my second visit to Singapore and had a lovely stay. 

We had arrived on an early United flight and got to the hotel around 10 AM. Our room was not available just yet so they let us leave our bags and visit the executive lounge for breakfast. The lounge is the best executive lounge I have ever seen at a Marriott. It blows the lounge at the JW in Mexico City and Kuala Lumpur out of the water. They had pastries, all sorts of cured meats and cheese, all sorts of fruit and fruit juices, a cereal bar, a dim sum section, and a made to order omelette station. 

After breakfast our room was ready and we were quite impressed by the size. We easily fit a roll away bed inside. The decor was very modern but I found that all the tracked rolling mirrors were frustrating at times. For instance, the bathroom mirror slides away into the bedroom which seems kind of pointless. This feature just allowed lots of noise to leak from the bathroom into the bedroom. Otherwise everything else was top notch: smart toilet, rainfall shower, automated blinds and curtains. 

Aside from the room I also spent a good amount of time at flow 18. They have a ping pong table, bar, pool table, and infinity pool up there. The view from the infinity pool is really pretty at night but unfortunately the pool water is quite cold since it is often in the shade and not heated. It is a little uncomfortable to lounge in which is quite a pity...

I want to note that the concierge was extremely helpful. I had bought city pass tickets for the wrong date (one week in advance doh!) and they were on the phone for over a half an hour deciphering what needed to be done. 

If you have Marriott gold status this hotel is an excellent choice and a strong upgrade from the Marriott on Orchard road.",23/2/2018,Hotels
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,5,"Hands down the best hotel I have stayed at period! I have stayed at thousands of hotels throughout the world and this is by far my favorite. From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave you are treated as you're an elite status person. 

Upon arriving and entering into the property there is a giant screen w/ a constant movie image straight out of tie dye from the 70s. Then entering into the registration area you see the class that the hotel has to offer. The staff was very friendly and it wasn't just the person I spoke w/ upon check-in, but EVERYONE on property. The check-in process was easy and quick. As we made our way to our room we entered the elevator and we noticed that the elevator changes light colors. 

Upon entering our room, my gf immediately got mad. Not because of the way the room looked, but because of how it looked. She had paid for us to stay one night at the Marina Bay Sands at $500 (see my review). We got more bang for our buck staying at this property than over at MBS. Within the room we were given 2 bottles of water complimentary. The bellman that helped us w/ our bags, showed us all the features to the room which was maintained from the television. From the curtains to the temperature to the tv itself. The rooms are newer so it has the USB plugs as well as the traditional ports.

The pool is located on the 14th floor if I recall. It's a small infinity pool w/ chairs in the water. It offers a view of downtown to which you can see the Marina Bay Sands, amongst other sites.

The main stand out for me was their Executive Lounge. Hands down the best lounge I have ever been too. This includes airport AND hotel lounges. In the lounge they offer not only your typical items, but pieces of sushi, a variety of fruits, veggies, snacks, candies and numerous other items. Not to mention a bar that has beer on draft! On top of that we were unable to have breakfast the next morning due to our early flight. The staff was kind enough to prepare a to-go breakfast for us.

The hotel is close to all the tourist sites. Singapore also has Uber which was easy to use from our hotel. 

If you're planning to stay anywhere in Singapore, I urge you to stay here. You won't be disappointed in any aspect. Amazing all around!",27/9/2017,Hotels
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,5,"This is my new fav hotel in Singapore. 2nd stay and 1st time reviewing it. Fairly new hotel, about 7m old as of this writing. It took over another hotel that didn't do well. 

Let's start from the hotel's road entrance. The entrance is located along nicoll highway although the address is 30  Beach Rd. This is probably one of the most confusing thing about the place. Uber, Grab, taxi don't know where to go if you say JW Marriott South Beach. This location is simply South Beach and the sign at the entrance on nicoll highway reflects that. The JW Marriott sign is on the hotel and half way up the building. The structure is remarkable and easy to identify so most times, I would point to it and tell the driver to drive in that direction. 

The main door of the hotel is in a cul de sac with a bowl of overflowing water. Around the bowl are quotes about water, including ""be like water ....."" - Bruce Lee. How cool is that?

Inside the entry is a huge digital display that has artsy design constantly swirling around. I saw a lot of people taking photos in front of it. I would suggest a video instead. 

Turn right and immediately left to see the front desks. It is long and during the day, it is filled with staff. Everyone I have met is so friendly. They greet you with a smile as you walk by them. Very good service. Always helpful. 

The decor is very comtemporary and nice. I did not like how the walls are painted. initially I thought they weren't, that it is dirty and waiting for a final coat of paint. I got use to it by the end of my stay. The lighting in the elevators changes and with each change, the pictures on the sides changes. 

The rooms - I had a room on the 21st and 15th floors. The first room faced raffles hotel, the second faced suntec. Views at these levels can't go wong but I do keep the shades closed as it can get warm with the sun shining in. 

High tech! That's how I would described the rooms. The curtains and shades are controlled by switches on the wall next to them or if you are a geek, use the tv with the remote. I bet you can spend 15 mins just playing with the curtains and shades. 

The SmartTV is also cool. I like the relaxing playlist. If you leave the tv on when you leave the room, it will start back up when you enter the room. Can be annoying as the volume auto goes back up. Also if it was on a playlist, it will likely have reached the end of that playlist and loops on that last song. You will need to go back to the category and then back to playlist to select the first song if you like to start from the beginning. 

The bed and pillows are very comfort. Everything in the room is shiny. Lots of reflective surfaces around the room makes it look huge. I love the couch by the window for reading.  Ample space to hang up your clothes. Not enough drawer space for me. There were 2 and smaller than usual. In between the two drawers is a drawer safe. Initially I had a hard time figuring where to put my suitcase and eventually found a smaller closet near the door. The wall paper covering made this closet ""disappear "" - think Sherlock Holmes. Anyway, hotel staff has access to this area as this where you would put your shoes and dirty clothes for laundry services. How neat is that?

Bathroom - you need to find it. the door leading into the bathroom is a huge mirror as well. The bathroom is gorgeous with the soaking tub. A separate toilet and shower means no need to fight over the use of the place, if you don't mind some soaking outside while you take a dump or vice versa. The toilet bowl is ... high tech too. The cover automatically opens when you approach it. The seat is heated. After you are done, the bidet can be customized for up to two users. Anyway, just try it. Shower room has spray as well as a rain shower head from the ceiling. There are two controls. The top control diverts water to the spray or the ceiling or Off. The bottom control controls the temperature. There is a small button on the control. To get hotter water,  press that button down before turning. It will allow you to increase temperature past the ""comfort"" zone.  The one complain about the bathroom is that there are no hangers! I had to drape the wet towel used after my showers over the soaking tub. There is a stool in the bathroom where housekeeping put the fresh towel each day. Other than that no hooks. 

Since I'm a club member, I had access to the lounge. No need to repeat what others have said. Service and space are amazing! I recommend the rendang omelet and the local selections are quiet good too. During my stay of 7 days, I have had most of my meals here. I did not see any waffle station mentioned in other reviews. Their smoke salmon selections and pastries are good. A friend had the big croissant and thought it was not fluffy enough. 

No more space to talk about JW spa that just opened. Another tip - there are 2 pools. Ebb6 is warmer than the one in 18th floor.",9/5/2017,Hotels
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,5,"My go to hotel in Singapore as it is close enough to downtown but in route to Changi business park (15 minutes away) where I work.

The marriott lounge breakfast is AWESOME.  Eastern and Western options, omelette stations cold cuts, fruit assortment fresh juices.  They have everything you need.  

Only issue with this hotel is the wait for a Taxi.  Not sure why they haven't solved this but give yourself 5-10 minutes each morning to wait for a taxi.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,5,"We have stayed in many JW Marriott Hotels around the world, but this one takes the cake as our best hotel experience in anywhere. 

There are several reasons for this. Firstly, the hotel is brand new, with the latest technology and chic rooms. Though the rooms were not large by US standards, it was very well-thought out. Our corner room 2016 had a fantastic view of the CBD (Central Business District) and a lovely view of the Marina Bay. We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands the last time we visited. It was crowded and impersonal. 

Secondly, the location is very convenient to shopping and dining. Across from the Suntec Mall, not far from the CBD (Central Business District) and Chinatown, and walking distance to the Marina Bay and Esplanade. We had lots to do in the area, but it was not difficult to get to other parts of the island with the subway train either. It was a beautiful and upscale part of town.

Last but not least, it was the staff that makes this place a gem. From the bellman to the front desk to the Executive Lounge, everyone was friendlier than the other. I'm an SPG Gold Member, so after Marriott merged, I became a Gold member with Marriott as well. We were able to frequent the Executive Lounge for Breakfast, Afternoon Tea, and evening Cocktails. Ann Margareth, Angela, Matin, Ken, and Chee Yean all went out of their way to make our visit memorable. Besides the Executive Lounge, Aaron from the front desk and Angie at the Valet were also outstanding. Honestly, every one we met were well-trained, courteous, and extended the Asian Hospitality in a very genuine way.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,5,"The service from the team here at the JW Singapore was outstanding from start to finish.

As a Platinum Premier, Marriott has been very good to take care of me on most of my hotel stays.  This specific hotel went above and beyond with regards to making sure I had a good stay.  For starters, they reached out over a week in advance to see if there was anything they could assist with prior to arrival.  They were also kind enough to upgrade the room to a beautiful suite far in advance.  Certainly unexpected, but more than appreciated.

Our arrival was late night due to the Singapore Airlines flight from Sydney's arrival.  We checked in around midnight.  Being that time, the hotel was of course quiet.  It was the perfect time to take in this wonderfully designed, modern hotel.  Check in was swift and efficient, with just the right amount of information.  Given our late night flight the next day, they also offered a late checkout, which we enjoyed because we wanted to see the light show at the Gardens By The Bay where the ""super trees"" are.

Room was amazing, VERY high tech, incredible comfortable and well designed.  Walk in closets, coffee bar, two bathrooms, double sinks in master, all electronic curtains and blinds, temperature controls and most hotel services are all on the television as well.  Note: Not for the technically challenged (my parents would not even get the lights on).

Lounge access the next morning for breakfast...also amazing.  Staff available to assist at ever corner, great food selections including a omelet chef, it has something for everyone.  We also took advantage of the afternoon cocktail hour and grabbed some food because our flight departed at midnight.

Rooftop pools, there are two.  We enjoyed the view from the 18th floor and relaxed without many guests.  There was also a gymnasium on this level.

No lack of service anywhere at this hotel.  Extremely friendly and every single employee said ""hello"".  Not kidding, EVERY single one.  Two gentlemen outside in the sweltering heat washing windows even stopped mid-task to say hello.  

I wouldn't hesitate to book this hotel on my next visit to Singapore.  They have everything I need and again, the service was incredible.",10/6/2017,Hotels
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,5,"Let's start by saying the JW Marriott has set the bar for excellence so high, I don't want to stay in another hotel again...let me explain.

I travel a decent bit and have a hard enough time deciding which hotel chain to commit too in a steady relationship. This JW Marriott in Singapore has more than won me over and assured me I made the right choice.

From the most accommodating and professional staff on the planet (not an exaggeration check my creds) to making the experience of traveling rewarding again, I cannot say enough positive things.

Checkin was beyond easy even with my early arrival (9AM) where the staff understood the whoas of flying and jet lag impact on even a simple hello on my part. I was able to get a shower and eat from the most brilliant breakfast spread in the Executive Lounge allowing me to step right into Singapore with a smile and level comfort seldom felt.

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,3,"My perspective is that of a business traveler.  Been coming to Singapore for 30 years, and have a certain level of expectation for a high-end hotel in this city.  JW Marriott just did not make it, and I'm a Platinum member, so I was really surprised and disappointed.  Checked in online, so the hotel would know I was coming.  Lots of warmth at the reception area, which was nice.  Open the door to my room: two single beds.  I'm only 6' tall, and my feet hung over the end of the bed.  Too tired after the flight from Europe to argue, just went to sleep.  Next morning, I requested a change: king bed, higher floor, a view.  Got all three, in a room that was actually physically smaller than the first night.  

As for the Executive Lounge, it seemed like it was open to anyone who was smart enough to go to the second floor, and walk across a breezeway.  Place was absolutely packed.  Perhaps there really were that many qualified guests, but who knows? No one ever asked for a room number or anything.

I will give props to two places in the general South Beach center: the Beach House Kitchen has a great breakfast buffet, and the Starbucks on the ground floor is very nice.

But the hotel?  I will likely not return.",3/3/2019,Hotels
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,5,"Two words, Fancy and impressive. I was here for business. Thank God. Personally, I don't think I will stay on my own dime. They staff here is outstanding.

My bed was extremely comfortable, and bathroom was so impressive. It's controlled by a remote control. The bathtub was huge. You get some awesome toiletries unlike other hotels. 
  I got the privilege of going to the business lounge. The amazing fruit juices and fresh cooked food and fresh local fruits, it's just amazing. I tried Jumbu (rose apple) at the lounge and I was looking forward to it every day.  I also ordered room services and only stuck to the local foods. They were catered to the American taste buds and took the spice out of it. Nonetheless, it was delicious.

My friend had to go down and request a room change thus making us wait some more after we just got off the plane and waited over half an hour for this first room. Honestly I just wanted to shower and change but since we had no choice we decided to go out and explore, big mistake cause it was really hot outside and I was definitely not in the right attire since the hotel had our luggage's. When we got back we were finally given a room with two beds one floor higher(still no view) but at least we finally had our beds. The bathroom is gorgeous with so many mirrors a soak tub and a rain shower as well as a Japanese toilet (very much appreciated since my friend tends to bomb the toilet and this toilet comes with a deodorizer) I can finally use the bathroom after 20 minutes instead of 2 hours. The beds were really comfortable and the pillows are amazing we couldn't stop raving about how comfortable they were. The pool is on the 18th floor with a nice view and a gym as well, room service has been so sweet they come by asking if you need anything, this one girl even gave me chocolate you can tell this hotel prides itself in their amazing service as the staff remembers each guests names and if they see you they always stop to say hello. If only we had a nicer view and didn't have the issue with checkin this would be a 5 star review",25/7/2018,Hotels
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,4,"Classy hotel in a good location with great service. Controlling the blinds from your TV is fun, as is the heated toilet seat with automatic opening, closing, and bidet, but you get more bang for your buck across the street at Fairmont (for example actual coffee in your room, not the powder packets).",8/4/2018,Hotels
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,4,Outstanding hotel and very pleasant staff. Poor selection of TV channels.  I recommend bringing a fire stick/Roku. Bathroom sink was clogged and bathroom mirror that opens up to bedroom was about to fall off the sliding track. Weekly inspection caught the issues but neither was repaired or followed up on during my stay after my initial request.  Automatic blinds and curtains with a beautiful view of the city. Bidet with heated toilet seat with a wireless remote was amazing. Chic infinity pool and bar on 18th floor and another pool on the 6th floor. Laundry service was overpriced so we washed our clothes at EASY WASH in Chinatown during our 10 night stay. Hotel is within Walking distance of Suntec city mall and plenty of restaurants. Nightly turn down service was nice. Free breakfast buffet. Fitness center was well equipped. Overall a beautiful place to stay and would certainly stay here again.,7/8/2019,Hotels

JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,5,"I think that this hotel has quickly climbed to near the top of my favorite hotels list. I spent a couple of nights here just a little more than a month after they opened and absolutely loved it. I stayed in a suite and the bedroom was in the corner of the building with a wonderful view. The bathroom had a full shower and a wonderful soaking tub, also with a wonderful view. Not sure I want to go into why I loved the toilet...but lets just say I did. Exercise facilities were also some of the best at any hotel. It has a pool, bar, ping pong table on a floor that is open all of the way around. It is not on the rooftop...but is on one of the higher floors. My only disappointment was at breakfast. Don't get me wrong...breakfast was great with different ""stations"" built around various types of food. The only disappointment there was the waffle/pancake station. It wasn't maned so the only choice were cold waffles that were cooked long before I arrived there. It was probably because I had breakfast pretty early each morning to beat the crowds. I imagine that it is maned most of the time. I won't even take the time to talk about how wonderful there service was and the great location. I will just say that this is now my hotel of choice in Singapore and I suggest you give it a try.",6/2/2017,Hotels
Gardens By The Bay,4,"Very nice area with plenty around to do. Staff was helpful and although flower dome was closed when we went, the cloud forest was open and was amazing. Would recommend!

Gardens By The Bay,5,Definitely one of my favorite activities of my trip. There's so much to see and do! Whether you have kids or just looking for a cool thing to do this is a must see when you're in Singapore. I think about gardens by the bay at least once a day. It puts American parks shame. there are so many free options of things to do plus an amazing food court and so many options for free!,3/1/2025,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,5,"Fantastic and free to wander.   There are many other attractions in the garden that cost such as the indoor Cloud Garden or the Super Tree walkway.  There are many different gardens and paths throughout this giant plot of land that are free to explore.

The artificial Super Trees are cool but even more so every evening when there are two free light shows.  The light show while short is great.  

The gardens are served by a couple of nearby metro lines and can be walked to from the downtown area.  It is adjacent to the mega Marina Sands hotel and shopping mall - where you can escape the heat and humidity.

A definite must see.",9/3/2025,Arts

Check out the towering supertrees that'll blow your mind, an indoor waterfall that'll make you go 'wowzers', and iconic conservatories that'll make you feel like you're in a real-life fantasy world.  All thanks to some amazing engineering and architecture that lets plants from around the world thrive in the tropics.",1/12/2024,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,5,"After spending a morning at the Singapore Zoo, where we got glimpses of the famous white tigers, rode a tram around the zoo's 69-acre pioneering open-concept zoo lush landscapes, and watched the amusing trained sea lion performances, a sightseeing stop at the spectacular Gardens By The Bay rewarded us.  The admission fee was S$32 per adult, which was included in our excursion.

We've been to the Gardens By The Bay's Supertree Grove nighttime light show and wandered through both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest during a previous visit, but this time, we got a different perspective of the gardens during the daytime.  We entered the Flower Dome, exploring unique plants native to the Mediterranean region, South African savannahs, and dry, arid deserts.  There were colorful blooming flowers everywhere, and since we were visiting in April, the central exhibit featured Spring-blooming tulips associated with Netherlands-like decor.  The wholly indoor and climate-controlled dome is comfortable to stroll through while admiring the flowers and plants and, fortunately, also provides many as a respite from the sun-scorching outdoor heat. 

As much as I enjoyed the beautiful flowers in the Flower Dome, I preferred wandering through the Cloud Forest, where the world's tallest indoor waterfall flows, and seeing the exotic, tropical, and lush plants found in tropical mountain regions from around the globe from elevated pathways.  We avoided some crowds waiting at the elevators to ascend the waterfall pathway by taking the staircases as we regained our energy by cooling down in the Flower Dome.  While walking down the elevated path, we were well above treetops and could view our next destination in the garden, the Skytree Observatory.

I can't decide which view I prefer between nighttime and day since the gardens look different based on the light source.   But, whenever you choose to explore the gardens, you'll undoubtedly treat your senses to the beauty of Mother Nature.",9/6/2024,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,4,"My first time visiting Gardens by the Bay - August 2024. I was at The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands and the shopping center has a connection where you can just take a few steps and voila - you are now at Gardens by the Bay. Unfortunately, it was raining on and off that day so I didn't get the chance to explore this spectacular place.

Also channeling my 'Crazy Rich Asian' life haha.",7/9/2024,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,4,"It's not for everyone.  Family, yes. Couples, yes. Young kids, yes. Grown adults... probably not. 

All that said - If you have time and have young kids, this is a great show before heading back to your hotel.  We went from the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome to the Super Trees for a night show. It was hot and muggy... we made it for the first showing at 7:45...   Everyone just lays down on the ground...  without a blanket... on that hard and dirty floor... I'm not a fan so we stood.. while the kids sat down.   It's basically 3 trees that are coordinated to a music medley... of old school jams...  if this is your kind of thing... worth a visit.  I was bored. But glad my kid enjoyed it.  

Fair warning, it's a mad dash exit and pile on to get your ""grab"" back to the hotel or your destination. Or walk, or take the MTR or wait it out...  it's insane.

Gardens By The Bay,4,"Was I glad I went? Sure.  But the light show at sunset at the SuperTrees is one of the main reasons to go here, and after putting in 20,000 steps after a long day, it's nice to plop yourself down to watch the show.

There's so much to see and do here, so give yourself at least an entire day to explore everything from the timed ticketed entrances to different shows.  I love that if you're lucky, the river will give off a light breeze to help with the stultifying heat and humidity.

Gardens By The Bay,5,"What's not to love about a beautiful, clean public park in the middle of Singapore?

We spent an afternoon here and then returned for the evening. The kids enjoyed the kids' park, but being outdoors, it was too hot for us adults (esp since we didn't bring bathing suits for the water area).

The indoor parks are spectacular. The Cloud Forest is more impressive, if you only want to pay for one entrance fee, pick that one. But the price difference between the one and both is not very high, so we went into both.

We went back at night to see the light show in the Super Trees. Definitely worth the trek back to the park. On our evening, the theme was the 1970s, and it was fun listening to that funk and disco music while enjoying the light show.

There are places to eat in the park, ranging from Satay on the Bay to ShakeShack.",23/7/2025,Arts

If you want to go in the domes or up the trees you have to pay, but we found that just walking around d the free areas was enough. Maybe if you LOVE gardens then spending the money to go in the domes and up the trees would be worth it, but for us it was not. The area around is pretty cool and gives off Vegas vibes.",14/6/2025,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,5,"A must-visit when in Singapore. There is plenty of area to roam and explore for free. Depending on the time you have and money you're willing to spend, there is also plenty more paid attractions such as the Cloud Forest worth adding on.

You'll need to keep in mind that all the free attractions are outdoor and it's always hot in Singapore. They do an amazing job lighting things up at night, so I'd recommend both a morning and evening visit. MRT stops right in the center and it is easy to grab a Grab (their Uber) from a variety of points in the Gardens.",29/12/2024,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,5,"I was in Singapore for a 14 hour layover and had two things on my list - hawker stalls and the new Jurassic World exhibit at Gardens by the Bay Cloud Forest. We went on a Saturday around 2pm and bought tickets there - the line was short and moved quickly. The ticket was $46 and allowed entry to Cloud Forest Jurassic Park and the Flower Dome. This was my first time here so I'm not sure how the Cloud Forest normally is but the Jurassic Park was epic! There were really well done animatronic dinosaurs with a big T-Rex that was awesome. They blinked and moved and had the audio effects too! Took a little more than an hour to walk the whole thing- it was nice since it's a set path that walks you through all the activities. They have a little baby dinosaur you can hold and get pictures with, a TeamLab type projection, a Disney World type part where they have a live show with a dinosaur, and more! Plus it's a beautiful building with meticulously upkept flowers and plants with a great view of the water. Very kid friendly (or good for adults like me haha). Highly recommend!

There are coffee and light bite can be purchased before going inside the dome.

So, if you don't think you'll ever come back to visit Singapore after visiting once, then I would definitely recommend visiting Gardens By The Bay and pay for all the attractions. This can definitely be a full day event if you're up for it. Also a paradise for the garden/plant enthusiasts and horticulturists alike.

However, I felt meh with this garden. It was hot and humid. Everything was a money trap. You have to pay to get on the bridge, pay for flower dome and sky dome and the skyview. We only went on the bridge which turned out to be $14 SGD per person (or was it $24pp?). I can't remember, but maybe the flower dome was $27 SGD per person? Yeah...

I think it could be worth it if I was into plants. Otherwise, this is a tourist trap.",17/2/2024,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,5,"The Gardens by the Bay stands at the foot of the gigantic Marina Bay Sands hotel (that looks like a cruise ship on stilts), but the Gardens are just as impressive.

As you walk around the Gardens on the ground, you'll see the recognizable buildings around you, but you'll also be treated across the bay to eye melting views of the Singapore skyline, dominated by the Singapore Flyer ferris wheel (probably the best spot for a photo of it). 

The most iconic feature in the Gardens by the Bay (that you've probably seen in travel shows and snaps) is the Supertree Grove. 

These are 80-150 feet high tree-like lighted structures so they definitely dominate that area of the Gardens. 

You feel so tiny walking under these gorgeous behemoths. They are a sight to behold during daylight hours, but when they're lit up at night, it's a whole different experience.

The other impressive sight (inside and out) is the Flower Dome conservatory. It's an interior greenhouse (the largest greenhouse in the world, btw), in a dome like glass structure. Inside the Flower Dome there are countless plants and flora being protected in the perfectly temperate Mediterranean climate. 

And finally, the other neatest feature is the Cloud Forest. It also is a glass greenhouse that is higher but more narrow than the Flower Dome. It features the Cloud Mountain in the middle, which is made up of flowers, ferns, and other plant life, and has a beautiful waterfall tumbling down its front.

There are so many amazing sights in the Gardens by the Bay, you can definitely spend an entire day here. 

Just remember that it looks very different during the day than at night, so I recommend going in the afternoon into the evening!",10/4/2024,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,5,"These beautiful gardens are free to visit at any time of day. There are regular light shows at the super trees so check the schedule for them. You might run into large monitor lizards near the ponds, but don't be afraid of them. There's regular food and drink stands, plus a nicer food court. You can reach the gardens over a bridge from the Shops at Marina Bay (us the escalators in the Shops and get to the roof, then follow the path), or by going through the metro station underground (Bayfront station). Bring a hat or umbrella for sun or rain. You will sweat walking around here! See my photos for a map posted near one of the entrances.",22/9/2024,Arts

We attended the night light show, but ended up being in the wrong location, so we only caught the end. It was still beautiful!

Came on the day of Mid Autumn Festival and it was packed as they had an event that evening. Evening to night is truly the best time to see the giant trees lit up. Everywhere was scenic, lush, and beautiful-I'm glad I got to visit this iconic place and found that it was not necessary to pay to enter the other spaces as it was already an enjoyable garden park already.",3/10/2023,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,5,"We spent 36 hours in Singapore last month, landing early in the morning after a short red-eye. Tired and unshowered, with hours to go until we could get into our hotel room, we took the subway to Gardens by the Bay. This was the right call, as it turned out: a morning visit when the heat was reasonable, a few hours before the promised afternoon rain. As first-time tourists, we were also happy to check Singapore's number one attraction off our list.

The place was spectacular, a 260-acre park dense with both plant life and architectural splendor. We'd been to the United Arab Emirates the week before and seen the Dubai Miracle Garden, an expression of floral opulence from the people who brought us the Burj Khalifa. Gardens by the Bay had the same over-the-top ethos, but it made the Dubai garden look like a small, charming amusement park.

Tickets were quite expensive, with most of the individual attractions priced a la carte. We bought combo tickets for the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, at $59 (SGD)--about $44 (USD)--apiece. We added the Supertree Observatory and the OCBC Skyway, which each cost another $14 (SGD) per ticket. Resident prices were considerably lower, which makes sense. If I lived in Singapore, my kids would grow up playing in the Gardens.

If you've seen Crazy Rich Asians (or, I don't know, googled Singapore, you've probably come across pictures of Gardens by the Bay and its distinctive Supertrees, striking tree-like structures that serve as vertical gardens teeming with orchids and myriad other plants. We started our visit at the Supertree Observatory in the tallest of the eighteen Supertrees, going up to a rooftop deck with breathtaking views of Singapore. We didn't make it to the Marina Bay Sands on this trip, but we did get some good pictures with it from the Supertree (it is, it must be said, a very cool but very ugly building).

We hit the OCBC Skyway next, getting the outdoor stuff out of the way while it was comparatively cool (sweltering hot by most standards) and not raining. This was an aerial walkway suspended between two Supertrees, with more lovely views.

The giant shell-like glasshouses of the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome form the other salient architectural feature of Gardens by the Bay. We spent most of our visit walking through this conservatory complex, which was genuinely astonishing.

The Cloud Forest offered a multi-story walk in the clouds, with a meticulously controlled tropical mountain climate, achieved with the help of periodic misting that gave it a Jurassic Park vibe (there was a light Jurassic Park--or at least Jurassic--motif running throughout the Gardens). We started at the top and wound down through the varying elevations, passing the giant indoor waterfall several times--apparently the second-tallest indoor waterfall in the world, after the Rain Vortex at the Changi Airport, which we saw the next day. The whole place was ragingly lush, with everything from carnivorous plants to countless varieties of orchids. Tons of stuff for the 'gram, what with the waterfall and the plant walls, plus Chihuly glass and a room full of stalagmites and stalactites.

The Flower Dome is the world's largest glass greenhouse, and it was sumptuous and impressive, with a sunny garden party atmosphere. We're from California and enjoyed the California garden, as well as the other regional gardens on display. I especially liked the many baobabs. The plants were interspersed with animal sculptures that were somehow not that cheesy. There was an Alice in Wonderland display, as well as a prominent Yayoi Kusama sculpture of a girl in colorful polka dots. The Flower Dome also has a space for a rotation of seasonal displays. We were there at the end of the Carnival of Flowers, an Australian carnival-themed floral show featuring kangaroos, a ferris wheel, and a merry-go-round (none real, but nice to look at). The Flower Dome ticket included entry into the Monet experience, which is what it sounds like, one of those pretty but soulless art attractions made for social media.

We browsed the gift shop and picked up a few souvenirs, including a post card and magnets and glow-in-the-dark T-shirts for our kids (surprisingly a much smaller selection of these for children than for adults). I loved the two women who helped us out, the no-nonsense older lady who knew exactly what sizes to get for our boys off the top of her head, and the younger cashier who checked us out with the lithe efficiency of a Vegas dealer.

We spent a good two hours at Gardens by the Bay, moving at a fairly brisk clip. It was a marvelous, one-of-a-kind place, a must-visit for anyone passing through Singapore. I kept thinking about how much my sons would enjoy it, and I hope to take them one day. I want to see their faces when they walk into the Cloud Forest and look up at that waterfall.",7/12/2024,Arts

There are things to do/see around the park. Some require admission fee. Supertree Grove skyway, Flower Dome, Cloud Forest, etc. The Garden Rhapsody light show at night is free.

Gardens By The Bay,5,"I've been tardy, and this review is as laggy as a dial up connection.

This attraction is worth it.  Yes, there is a ton of people, and it takes aways from the experience when one is visiting a garden.  Then again, if you've been to Singapore.... it is crowded everywhere.  If I was a mosquito, i would wanna be in Singapore, cos there is no shortage of food.

We visited during Chinese New Year, and they had a special exhibit going on, and a nite event, and it was ... crowded.  Getting in was not an issue, the lines were fast, and again like everything else in Singapore.. it was efficient.  The line was approx 2000km long, but it was moving at light speed, so that's good. Once inside, it was smaller than expected.  The plants were healthy, the paths were wide, you can go at your own pace.  Do take your time, they;ve gathered a formidable collection of plants from all over the world.  Like all 4 corners of the world, all staged for  your enjoyment, so you better line it.. hmmph.

The blooms that was in season were the spring season , Chinese New Year theme when I visited.  Stunning, color, variation, and all super healthy.

Gardens By The Bay,5,"This was a highlight of our short trip to Singapore.  I'm not sure where to begin as the complex is so massive. We started at the Flower Dome (fee area), where we literally spent hours. There were two levels of themed indoor gardens to explore and to take photos. We explored slowly, both to enjoy the exhibits but also to explore the oppressive Singapore heat and humidity!   We then went outside to explore some of the FREE outdoor areas -- which included a walk through the Kingfisher Wetlands, and photos bear the floral clock. 

Later, we enjoyed the FREE light and music show at the Supertree Grove. Tip: get there early for good seats. (Most people sit on the edges of the giant flower planters).

By then, I was tired but we had already purchased tickets to the Supertree observatory. You go up an elevator to an open upper area with magnificent views of the Singapore skyline, Ferris wheel, and other attractions. The evening lights were magical. I took a ton of somewhat obstructed photos before realizing that there is another level that you could take stairs up to with unobstructed views. A good excuse to take more photos.",27/4/2023,Arts

I was in Singapore a few months ago but it just seemed like yesterday. We got tickets through viator which is a third party but it includes the full tour of the gardens. Flower dome is a beautiful walk through where you can see all the flowers from different countries even different theme arrangements. Luckily we went near Christmas and New Years so they had the cutest elf spring theme and reindeer sleigh theme. It was so huge you literally can get lost. From desert flowers to holland tulips and Italian greenery. They have so much things you can learn.

Cloud forest- The other part of the tour was like walking into the avatar movie. the waterfalls and sounds were so amazing. You can literally walk up to the 6th floor and reach the very top of the Forest dome. There are also elevators to make it easier for those tho can not walk too much or those with strollers. Each floor had something so cool to see. you can literally touch the leaf pad and it takes your hand warmth to generate light all throughout the forest. Also there is a floor where you can see an actual avatar flying dino with its eggs. A simulator where you can turn into an avatar and just so much to mention.

There is everything for everyone, and you can't come to Singapore without checking out the Gardens!",8/1/2024,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,5,What an amazing place to visit! The cloud Forrest is a must see. I swear it was like walking into the future. Saw this place on a Netflix show called Feeding Phil and had to check it out.,9/7/2024,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,5,"When you think of Singapore, shopping and eating come immediately to mind.  The food culture is simply overwhelming here with restaurants everywhere: hotels, hawker centers, malls, MRT stations, and yes standalone restaurants.  Some big food courts even have smaller food courts inside.  Don't get me started on the malls either - imagine the Las Vegas strip with casinos replaced by malls. That's like Orchard Road.

To take a break from all this and get back to nature, I highly recommend Gardens By the Bay.  They have multiple ticket options and you can easily spend 1 hour to an entire day here.  The Gardens, and the neighboring Marina Bay Sands lights up at night.

Highlights of my visit:
* The lowest price ticket is Floral Fantasy.  You get entrance through an indoor conservatory with some very artistic floral arrangements, complete with waterfalls, statues, and sounds.  Lots of places for selfies and Instagram-worthy pictures.  At the end, there's a cool 4D virtual ride which provides a nice overview of the other exhibits.
* The Poison Dart Frog exhibit was cool, showing multiple species of this tiny, but dangerous animal. The Gold one secretes enough poison to kill 10 people or 20,000 mice.
* After that, its free to walk around the massive gardens yourself to check out those SuperTrees and some truly amazing outdoor art sculptures.
* For food and drinks, try the Jurassic Food Court serving up 1-Michelin dishes like ramen, soya chicken, etc. at the various food stands.  
* You can get some nice shots of the Bay, Marina Bay Sands, and Singapore Flyer too.
* Signage is good so you won't get lost wandering.  It did take us a few iterations to find the entrance to the MRT station.",12/9/2023,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,5,"If you come to Singapore, you have to check this place out. If you don't have time, I'd just check out the Cloud Forest and the OCBC Skyway. If you can, come in the evening for the Supertree light show at 7:45 PM. 

I came here, via MRT, on a late Monday afternoon in early December 2022. Apparently if it rains, you will not be granted access to the OCBC Skyway. At the time I went, there was a Christmas thing going on so there was no reentry after leaving the Supertree Grove area, which something I did not know about. They made me pay another $12 on top of everything else to get back into the Supertree area for the 7:45 PM light show. 

This place is huge. Give yourself plenty of time and where good walking shoes. I didn't get to see the Floral Fantasy but if I ever go back to Singapore I'd probably try that one. The guy I bought tickets from didn't recommend that one so I didn't check it out.",7/12/2022,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,5,"Gardens by the Bay is a must visit for me every time I'm in Singapore. It's free to explore most of the grounds, and they're absolutely stunning. I love coming in the evening to attend the light show in Supertree Grove. It's free to watch and makes for such a fun activity. The Cloud Forest Dome and Flower Dome are both beautiful and worth the visit. It's around $34/person for entry to both domes. Currently they have an exhibition in the Flower Dome called Tulipmania until May 26. It's gorgeous and transports you to the Netherlands. I definitely recommend making a visit if you can while they still have Tulipmania! Regardless, it's a wonderful place to visit year round.",10/5/2024,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,5,"Gardens by the Bay is a must visit in Singapore!

It's super centrally located and easy to get to. Even if you don't pay to visit the inside, they have the gorgeous light up trees which are best seen at night.

For you Americans... they have a Starbucks and McDonalds (with very fun McFlurry flavors like MANGO!).

PS there is air conditioning inside!",1/7/2022,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,5,"Easily one of the best gardens you will ever see (probably the best ever) You can visit the gardens for free with exception of the cloud forest, flower garden & super trees.

First visit to the Gardens by the bay could easily be a while or at least half day experience.  I only went for 2-3 hours and that wasn't enough.  Next time I visit I look to stay longer.  The gardens are huge with many different types of gardens and tons of food options.  For food I just opted for shake shack, but they have a food court, hawker center and other popular dinning options on the site.  

If you could only do one ticketed event I would have to say it would need to be the cloud forest.  A rain forest dome with a mountain you can scale on the center with a multi story water fall.  We probably spent most of our time here and it speaks to just how grand things are in Singapore.  I did see the flower dome which was really good, but not as impressive as the cloud forest.  Back in the States we have the Bellagio gardens in Vegas which is what this reminded me of.  

One word of advice is the gardens grounds are huge  and it can be easy to get lost especially at night which happened to me.  The night time show with the super trees is nice, but not necessarily a must. 

During my time I've seen a lot of beautiful gardens but nothing like this.  This is the one major attraction in Singapore that if you could only visit one you must see!",9/9/2022,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,5,"This is the most iconic spot in Singapore, in my opinion. As in, if you only have a short amount of time and can only make it to ONE place, this would be it. The main attractions are the very famous super grove trees, cloud forest, flower dome, floral fantasy, and OCBC skyway (walkway).  Aside from this there are also many smaller attractions like garden areas, pathways, and more.  

You could easily spend a whole day here if you really wanted to explore.  You could also do it in a couple hours too. I'd personally recommend about 3 hours to hit the main parts.

Admission to the park itself is free, however you will have to buy tickets for the bigger attractions like some of the ones mentioned above. The super trees are free though! I think that's pretty cool since they are probably the most well-known image you'd think of. You can buy these other tickets ahead online, and that's very convenient. They have several options depending on what all you want to do. I'd say my favorite ticket item was the cloud forest (which is typically sold in combination with the flower dome) and the OCBC skyway.  I just loved being among those super trees I had seen in photos so many times.

I almost forgot! They also have a light show at the trees 2x every night. Again since the super tree area is free, the show is too! It was really cool. When I was there, the show was about featuring different Asian countries. It felt very fitting since I was hopping around to some of these countries at the time :)",21/6/2023,Arts

Gardens By The Bay,5,"This is a review of the light show of the Super Trees. Light show is daily. Times are 7:45pm and 8:45pm. During the winter holidays they had added a later time. The show only lasts 10 minutes. I believe each night the display is different. This was my first visit but came with a local who told me it was different than he remembered. There is also music with the lights and during Christmas, holiday music was played. We arrived at 8:30pm on Sunday night and there were a lot of people there. Some people have claimed seats but the show is best seen standing, though you may strain your neck a bit by looking up. Some people had hogged spaces by laying down so they can look up. Even at night, we were sweaty. It can get so humid here.",16/2/2023,Arts

Gardens By The Bay,5,"Likely the number one attraction in Singapore! Beautiful, unique , and not to be missed!  It's a live garden so you would always see different flowers and plants at different times. 

I've come a few times and am always amazed by the designs and creative ideas - the vertical garden is especially amazing. 

Definitely a 5-star and must go place when in Singapore!

Gardens By The Bay,4,"A must see night show.  They have to wait until dark before the show can start.  You can enjoy the other two attractions before the night show.  You can do this a day trip.  They have more than few spot for food.  They have hawker center, which you should try their satay (cheap and tasty) and beer.
As reminder, the weather is always hot and a lot of walking. Make sure you wear something comfortable.   You can take different MRT to get to this location or walk from MBS hotel.   The skywalk ticket booth is nearby the tree and not at the main ticket location.",4/3/2024,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,5,"Gardens By The Bay is one of the spots you must stop at while visiting Singapore!

It is a mix of botanical gardens and Avatar-inspired trees that light up the night every night. I was lucky to go during the holidays so they had large holiday decorations, lights, and live music. There are different tunnels to go through that also light up as well.

There is an additional cost to go on the sky deck which is the upper part of the Avatar ""trees"" where you can cross bridges. It might not be for the faint of heart for those who don't like heights but I am sure the water and city view is breathtaking. 

You can easily spend an evening here and grab some great photo and video ops. The entrance is fairly close to Marina Bay Sands so you can couple up the excursion together if you decide to do both (or are staying at Marina Bay Sands).",8/1/2024,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,5,"Gardens by the Bay is a must-see when in Singapore! Located behind the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, the area is a short walk from the hotel. You can easily spend half a day or more visiting all the attractions, and my husband and I ended up splitting our visit into two days. One evening to see the Supertrees, walk the OCBC Skyway, and watch the light show, and a second day to visit the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. I used Klook to buy tickets to the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest and saved a decent amount off the door price. 

I think the best time to visit the Supertrees and walk the OCBC Skyway is sunset. You'll get those serene pictures of the trees lit up at night (they don't have the same effect during the day) and can catch the nightly 15 minute light show at either 7:45 or 8:45 pm. We did have to buy a separate ticket to go up to the OCBC Skyway and were limited to 15 minutes at the top to keep traffic flowing. The line however, moved pretty fast, and the walkway gave great views of the MBS Hotel and the bay and an aerial view of the trees. The Supertrees are mesmerizing when all lit up, and watching the free Garden Rhapsody light show with my husband was a nice and romantic way to start off our honeymoon. 

It is cherry blossom season in the Flower Dome, and there were a lot of flowers in bloom during my recent visit. The dome features plants and trees from around the world. It took us about 45 minutes to get through the exhibit, and we really liked seeing the Baobab trees and the dragon statue on display. 

The Avitar Experience at the Cloud Forest was a lot of fun. When we first walked in, we saw this massive indoor waterfall and felt like we had been transported to Pandora. Various Avitar characters are scattered throughout the exhibit, and there were opportunities to turn ourselves into an Avitar character and to fly a Banshee! We went up to the top of the waterfall and took the various pathways down. It was great to feel what it's like to be in the cloud forest and to see more great views of the bay. My husband and I spent slightly more than 1 hour in the cloud forest, but the experience could have taken much longer on a busy day. Both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest exit into a gift shop, and I bought myself a set of Supertree stickers to remember the visit. 

There are plenty of food options on-site. We ate at the Jurassic Nest Hall, which allowed us to try several of Singapore's Michelin-rated places, including Hawker Chan's famous Soya Sauce Chicken and Tsuta's Soba Ramen. I was a little disappointed in the Soya Sauce Chicken, but my bowl of Tsuta Ramen was delicious! I ordered the original Truffle Shoyu Soba, and my husband had the crab soba. The soup base was rich in flavor, and the soba noodles were filling but not heavy like traditional ramen noodles. We also tried Took Lae Dee. I highly recommend their Pad See Ew as it was better than any Pad See Ew I've ever had in California. 

Gardens By the Bay was definitely one of the highlights of my trip, and by going on a weekday, we avoided the crowds!",6/4/2023,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,4,(4.25) ~ Very good Overall experience. Note: You need tickets for Cloud Forest; Flower Dome; & Supertree.

Gardens By The Bay,5,"This place is beautiful! You can buy your tickets online, which might be quicker. We wanted to ask if we could go see every exhibit, and if there was a combo rate. To save you the trouble, there isn't lol. There is probably 4 exhibits you can combine to get a better rate, but other than that you will have to buy the rest separately. 
The exhibits are all walking distance from one another, but you can buy the shuttle service if you have trouble or get tired from walking. They do recommend doing the walkway and the observation deck first due to the unpredictable weather in Singapore. The walkway was pretty scary, but surprisingly the observation deck wasn't. I would recommend doing the deck more than the walkway. 
Other than those two exhibits, everything else was indoors. While we were there, they had an aviator exhibit which we thought was really really cool. They have VR machines that turn you into an avatar. 
This place can get busy, and tickets can sell out. 
With your ticket, you can enter any time of day. Although I'm not too sure of in and out privileges. 
If your hungry, plenty of fast food restaurants like shake shack and McDonald's are located on the gardens as well.",29/11/2022,Arts

The park itself is free and you can walk around an enjoy quite a bit here without purchasing any ticket. However, I would recommend doing a couple of attractions like Cloud forest, Flower dome or the skywalk. You'll need to purchase tickets for each of those. 

You get a beautiful view of the whole city and the various attractions like Marina Bay Sands, Singapore Flyer and Merlion from various parts of the park and do stay for the light show in the evening.

You'll be dead tired at the end of the day but it's well worth the time spent here.",10/2/2020,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,5,"An obvious tourist attraction you should check out when visiting Singapore. Yes, it can get crowded but it's definitely worth checking out the Supertree Grove (this is free but if you want to do the sky walk, you need to buy tickets). It's more crowded at night since most people want to see the trees lit up at night - especially for the Garden Rhapsody show, which is every night at 7:45 and 8:45. The show lasts for about 15 minutes. If you're coming from the Shoppes at Marina Bay, there's a way to cut through the mall, instead of walking all the way outside and around to the Grove. The day time is much less crowded. It's still pretty in the day time so I would recommend checking it out both times if you can. During the day, there are some hawker stalls set up by the Supertrees. Also in the same vicinity is the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome (tickets required for each). You would need a whole day just to explore the area, especially if you want to lump in Marina Bay as well. We ended up trekking to the area on two separate days from Chinatown (where we were staying) and it was totally worth the trip.",8/12/2022,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,4,"Unfortunately, we didn't get to see the supertrees skyway due to the rain the last two days we went here. They closed the OCBC skyway observatory deck due to safety reasons. I mean that's good but bad timing for us. Our ticket lasts 5 months so we'll see if we come back or give it away. There are no refund if we miss the opportunity to go. It's unfortunate. :-(

The trees were beautiful decorated with plants and flowers especially during their light show at 8pm. You have to stay close by the area to reserve a seat to see this an hour before the light show. We saw this afar and it was beautiful none the less. 

Hopefully, you don't come here during the rainy season and miss this like us. It would be well worth the advance purchase. At least, we got to see the Cloud and Flower domes since it's covered. [33/100]",10/2/2020,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,4,"Architecture and man made topographical landscaping  at its best.

There are hours worth of walking trails not to mention the flower garden and cloud forest which are unique in their own ways and loads of family friendly activities. 

This place suits anyone regardless of how much time you have and money you want to spend. If you want to go all out and spend a whole day there's enough stuff to do that but if you don't want to spend money and only have an hour a stroll around the super tree grove is more than worth it. Catching a light show at night here is extra special. Highly recommended any time of day!",1/6/2022,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,4,"If you have never been to the Amazon Spheres, it's worth a visit. If you've never been to the Gardens by the Bay, it's worth a visit. If you're showing a friend around, it's worth the visit. Other than that, to be quite honest, it's not really a thing you'd want to visit over and over. 
Even the Avatar exhibit was kinda let down: seemed like the picture booth, aka ""avatarize yourself"" was kinda lame, sorry to say. A few of the things promised, like the ""fly a banshee"" were closed, and some of the other gimmicks were not only, well, gimmicky, but also out of order.
Anyway,  the fact that the gardens are enclosed in air conditioned environment that gives your group a break from the often oppressive heat and humidity of Singapore, makes the price of admission worth Every. Single. 
Singapore. Dollar!!!

Gardens By The Bay,3,"The first thing to know about Gardens By The Bay is that it is one massive tourist attraction. It has highly constructed facilities that you can pay to go into, plus it has large gardens, ponds, and even a few aquariums around the property that are offered free of charge.

For many, they find this location a great place to spend time with the family. It is also a good place to get in a little exercise and walk and/or run around. 

Personally, for those of us who know what this area of Singapore used to be like... Meaning, those of us who are a little bit older, we may remember what this area was, once upon a time. For me, that was a much more ascetically pleasing period of time. This is not to say that Gardens By The Bay is not a great place but I am just saying that it lacks any true Singaporean culture. 

So, go here if you want to interact with a lot of tourists and see some marginally interesting tourist attractions. But, if you want to see what Singapore is truly all about, you may have to go to other locations.",2/10/2019,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,5,"How anyone could walk out of this magnificent creation and not be amazed is beyond me. It's absolutely incredible. You get to explore three astounding waterfront gardens with plant species from 5 different continents over 250 acres. There are plants so rare you have to travel to specific parts of third world countries if you ever want to catch a glimpse - unless you're here. 

You can see the ginormous conservatories from MBS and the freeway. If you didn't know you'd think they were large offices or rather unique apartments because Singapore is all about unique. The real gem of it all are the Bay South Gardens, comprised of two conservatories: the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. 

The Flower Dome was absolutely amazing, beautiful and striking in every way. The colors of the rainbow splash throughout the entire dome. It's almost overwhelming how many plants are being grown here. I believe there are 8 different gardens featured here, my personal favorite being the Succulents. The Cloud Forest was just as impressive. The ginormous Cloud Mountains stands at 138 feet, and it's just spectacular to admire. You have to take a picture by the waterfall to complete the experience, and walk to the top of the mountain! 
Lastly I thoroughly enjoyed walking through the Supergrove trees, especially at night. 

The entire park is an absolute gem. I truly believe this is one of the most beautiful, if not the most, creations by man. The design, the work, the brain behind the concept is an intricate example of visions of grandeur accomplished. It is a must visit for tourists in Singapore!!!",10/6/2020,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,5,"I remember I was scrolling through a friends' feed and there was a picture of him posed in front of the Gardens By the Bay in the background.  I was fascinated by the trees behind him in that picture which made me research more of Singapore.  Thus, I thank my friend for planting the seed to visit Singapore 1.5 years ago.  Thanks Jose.

In my opinion, The Gardens By the Bay is synonymous to Singapore.  As the same can be said about with the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.  They just go hand and hand together.   Like dark chocolate dusted with sea salt. Together. 

The Gardens By the Bay is a large park which is free to enter.  There is no admission to walk around the park.  I saw a lot of locals jogging around the park at night.  I can't imagine doing that during the day.  That said, the attractions which include the two domes (the Cloud Forrest and Flower dome) and OCBC Skyway are paid admission fees.   I encourage you to pay to see all three.  I only had the opportunity to see the two domes and missed the chance to go to the skyway.  But, I was very particular as too when I wanted to go on the skyway since the paid admission is for only one usage.  The domes on the other hand, allow you to get a re-entry stamp when you exit which is valid for the entire day.

Both the Cloud Forrest and the Flower dome have their charm.  Head to the Flower Dome if you want to immerse yourself in a bouquet of flowers from all over the world.   If you want to feel as if you are in a different planet, go to the Cloud Forrest.  The Cloud Forrest also boasts having one of the largest indoor waterfalls.  It is a spectacular sight to witness with your own eyes.  Explore both domes and learn about sustainability which is prevalent in the structure and urban planning of this beautify country.

I would encourage you to see the park both during the day and at night as the park truly gives off a different energy during both times.   In the evening, there is a light show with the skytreees in the skytree grove that is mesmerizing.   

Note - I would plan accordingly if you do go to the Gardens at night.  Last admission time for the OCBC Skyway is 8pm. Also note that if there is a sign stating that there will be street food, it is concession type food.",6/10/2019,Arts

If you want to see the full beauty of it, see it at night. It's much cooler and more rewarding to see it lighted up. 

It's still nice to walk and meander around the area during the day and you must go up to the cloud by the forest nearby if you are already here anyways. The cloud forest was mostly why I made the jaunt to the gardens.

If you are planning to do this it is cheaper to buy a package ticket for a few of the attractions. 

The grounds have everything you could need. There is a shuttle service that will take you around to the different areas. There are plenty of bathrooms and even 2 different food courts for eating. When visiting definitely plan to spend an entire day here. the grounds are beautiful and I definitely recommend paying extra for the tickets to see the cloud forest and flower dome.

I came here after dinner nearby to enjoy the nightly laser show. When I visited, they had two shows at night, 7:45pm and 8:45pm. Each show lasts about 15 minutes. Many people arrives early to secure places to sit. No chairs or anything. They bring picnic blanket to sit on the concrete floor.  I didn't have anything with me so I just sat directly on the concrete floor but my clothes didn't seem to get that dirty.

Toilet facilities were nearby and inside was very clean.

Laser show itself was okay. I got bored after 5 minutes. They continued to play different songs but laser show was the repeat of the same thing.  Song choice was interesting. I think I went on a special night where they played 70's and 80's, some 90's songs from the U.S. Lot of them reminded me the fun time I had while in college...

Gardens By The Bay,5,Amazing immersive experience. Absolutely breathtaking! I felt like in an Avatar movie . The evening show is a MUST. It is free unless you want to walk on the trails in the trees. It's also incredibly clean and feels so safe even walking on your own at night.,8/3/2023,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,5,"If you visit Singapore even for a day and skip the Gardens by the Bay, you're doing it wrong. It's a very unique Experience in the tropical climate. It's a must go place whether you are a local or visitor. They constantly bring in seasonal flowers and plants from all over the world. You get to enjoy all this at the comfort of cool temperature and humidity.

Must visit this place to get the info how trees/plants are helping us to live in this world. Gardens by the bay Singapore is one of the most famous place in the world. it's amazing, you will feel something different which is directly connected with mother nature. I love this place and specially the show they put up every evening around 7:45pm. Strongly recommend buying a ticket to get up to the super trees sky deck during the show and watch them up close.

Everything is  so well maintained. Walking by the road along the river you can come to marina bay mall, where is nice artificial reservoir outside with water lilies. You can also see the Singapore Eye on the other side. The art and creativity was fantastic. It was one of my memorable travels visiting this place at Singapore!",9/12/2018,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,5,"Expect to spend at the very least half a day at this site. Really, to get enough hours you should schedule a full day. This place is extremely unique, with a blend of modern technology and style with traditional botanical elements. 

The Flower Dome is full of flowers from all over the world while the Cloud Dome *SPOILER* literally has a waterfall coming from the top of a mountain full of vegetation and a winding path. *END* Both domes have indoor cooling (and humidity) to match the needs of the plants. They also had themes inside the Flower Dome when I visited since it was nearing Christmas.

After these two domes, you can choose to walk around the gardens and especially to the Super Trees. These structures are full of plants inside and light up in the evening. For a fee, you can also walk on the paths between the trees in the tree canopy. From here, you can get beautiful views of the Marina Sands Bay hotel also.

You can book tickets online, or wait in line to purchase entrance tickets. There wasn't a long wait, but it could get long as there's only a handful of ticket windows. On the day we went, there were brief showers and it was very humid. Wear waterproof shoes or shoes you don't mind getting a little wet.",6/2/2019,Arts
Gardens By The Bay,5,"Free...Free. Others areas you pay but mostly Free.

The only thing I didn't like is you can't walk there from the flyer (big spinning wheel) which has a lot of food options. This place however has fast food only, quick snacks which is why you should come here after the wheel so you can eat up.

The big trees are massive and beautiful from every angle . Just sit there with ice cream and enjoy it at night. You can walk above them but that cost a ticket and time in line. Singapore isn't as hot as other places in Asia, so it's comfortable to walk around in.

One of the main attentions next to the lion, hotel, and wheel.",15/8/2019,Arts

This bar is ranked #43 in the world's 50 best bars in 2024 which I think should've been ranked way higher. The atmosphere definitely heightened everything from the drinks to food to seating.

This place is terrible LOL. There's far more to being a good bar/restaurant than overrated interior decor. And when my beer is completely gone, my plates pushed away, WHY does it take 15-20 min for someone to check in??

I spent a fair amount of time just slowly taking in the design elements and of course took a ton of pictures to commemorate my visit to a bar that made the world's best list (and I can see why). 

I was prepared, lol. I made a reservation over 90 days in advance, having been warned that they get booked up almost immediately. 

The service was just right. Attentive enough, not overbearing. The perfect balance. Also, they have the most delicious espresso martini I have ever tasted. Hands down.

You must come here for a cocktail experience to remember!",25/7/2023,Food & Beverage
ATLAS,5,"This was truly a gorgeous space with excellent cocktails, and even better service. We were able to get a four top without a reservation, and hold the table for about an hour and a half. This was in a very very early evening, and if you're trying to visit without a reservation, I recommend going around that time. 

The cocktail list is massive, and I admit I was a bit overwhelmed . I went with the seasonal martini and I'm so glad I did! It was made with local citrus and incredible gin. I'm not even usually a martini drinker, but this converted me. Really wonderful stop during a trip to Singapore!",25/7/2025,Food & Beverage
ATLAS,4,"The building, decor, bar, seating, and ambience are off-the-charts great. The cocktail menu is eclectic. I tried the Atlas Old Fashioned, which has blended, peated Scotch instead of rye. It has a couple other twists. It was interesting. The smokiness of the Scotch was a marked contrast to the sweetness of the sugar and the citrus. I think the flavors clashed. That's OK though. I ordered it. It was made well. I drank it. All good.

My party had some madeleines, bread, and fries. All good. The fries were outstanding.

The only miss was the service. I think better trained servers would have really made this an incredible experience. It was very nice...but not incredible.",22/8/2025,Food & Beverage
ATLAS,5,"I had such an awesome experience here! I attempted to make a reservation here but they were booked out so decided to drop in based on many recommendations. Upon walking in, they were able to accommodate us at the bar (which is my preference anyway) and the entire restaurant is beautiful inside. There are no bad spots. 

The bartenders were all very knowledgeable, had great recommendations backed up by quality drinks, and I loved the food. He recommended truffle fries which I've had a million times which I like fries, love truffles, but it's typically a little truffle oil on some fries with Parmesan how I've experienced and leaves a lot to be desired. The fries came out covered in freshly grated truffle and were unbelievable. I'm not sure I've ever had fries and left wanting more until this experience. I had the escargot as well which I also really enjoyed and the flavor was different from what I'm used to. 

For drinks, I started with the martini flight. I'm a huge espresso martini girl (sorry bartenders) and this one did not disappoint. I also loved the citrus twist martini and the other one was good but mostly not my flavor profile. My friend had the French 75 which I love but typically ask to hold the syrup. The peach added made a nice twist but too sweet for my profile. Overall this was an incredible experience. I definitely recommend it.",6/4/2025,Food & Beverage
ATLAS,5,"Swanky and sexy is how I describe this bar!  I found it difficult to get a reservation on the weekends so I booked on a Tuesday evening with no trouble.  It's quite stunning and feels so upscale.  The service was amazing and attentive.  I tried the martini flight and loved it!  As for food, we shared a few starters.  I highly recommend the octopus that was perfectly cooked and the most delicious and creamy  burrata I've ever had!  I'll definitely be back!",27/6/2025,Food & Beverage
ATLAS,5,"As a gin lover, this was one of the things I was most looking forward to in Singapore. I was a little bummed that they sat us so far away from the bar, but our servers were very knowledgeable and great at making recommendations since the menu is so hefty. I particularly loved the gin and tonic menu because it really shows all the intricacies gin can have.

ATLAS,4,"This is likely the prettiest bar you'll ever visit and they make excellent drinks, but that doesn't make up for a few details that need correcting.

Order any drink with the name Atlas in it for a wonderful cocktail. We tried them all and loved each. However, the Atlas orange G&T came with the tonic water separate. If I wanted to pour my own drink I'd make one at home. The bill showed that still water isn't free making this the only bar of this caliber that didn't provide free tap water. The bartender didn't interact with us outside serving the drinks. That's totally okay on its own, they could have had a rough day. However, at other Top 50 bars in the area the bartenders happily interacted with us or even struck up conversation on their own. It's was a disappointing experience when you compare them to other bar counter experiences.

Overall I don't think $28 SGD per drink is warranted (as of September 2024) at Atlas. It's a good bar, but probably not a 50 Best Bar at the moment.",21/9/2024,Food & Beverage
ATLAS,3,"Made a reservation for 6 pm for our large party they accommodated us even though last minute. One person in our part had been here previously so we were filled in on having the gin semallia assist us in selections with pairings unfortunately this time it did not happen. We all ordered different gin martinis I had one barreled in Au and had strawberry jam and Basil notes. Although the drinks were amazing at $28 plus a drink I was expecting better service and it did feel short.
The first round our waiter missed my drink and hence had a toast with an empty glass and the martini I ordered was obviously one no one orders as the confusion set in and again was late on arrival. Yes beautiful inside interior but lacking service at a big price l expect better.",26/7/2024,Food & Beverage

Having come from Thailand on a business trip had mostly beach type clothes, but luckily had a shirt and some pants which fit the smart casual requirement to enter. About a 45 min wait, but overall once seated understood why. The ambiance of this place was amazing...the bar is stunning and the art deco interior unreal. However, was here for the drinks and they didn't t disappoint! The crew went through 3 different rounds and there was not a bad cocktail in any of them.

The architecture was absolutely gorgeous and the staff is also very friendly and professional. The interior screams Great Gatsby vibes. 

Wished we could have planned it a bit better in advance, but even months before our trip there were no reservations available on their website. When we went we could have waited for 1.30 hrs for a table but decided to just have drinks at the bar instead, which was first come first serve. 

Drinks were of course pricey but also very unique. I recall their drinks menu had inspiration from different cities around the world --hence the name Atlas. Some drinks had an accompaniment of chocolate as a palette enhancer. 

I must also say the complementary beet chips were addicting. 

I definitely recommend sitting at the bar if you want to see the bartender wheel the ladder to grab the fine alcohol on the top shelf.",5/2/2023,Food & Beverage

ATLAS,5,It's on the top 50 best bars list and once you enter it's easy too see why. The facade and decor wouldn't look out of place in an Egyptian museum. That being said it is wickedly crowded and hard to get a reservation. Your best bet is to try a weeknight or very late on a weekend. We went on a Saturday at 1am and got lucky to get a nice seat. Drinks are great.. They have a extensive gin collection to boot and their cocktails are on point. Definitely worth checking out irrespective of whether you are staying here or just visiting.,11/2/2020,Food & Beverage
ATLAS,5,"Bruce Wayne approved.

This gloriously opulent art-deco styled bar, luxuriously appointed with vaulted mural ceilings, is located in the ground floor of a Gotham City inspired skyscraper. 

Named after the Greek titans of endurance bearing the mirror-sheened Atlas stone in front of the entrance - you'll be pleasantly surprised as you enter and take in the optics of this stunningly designed wonder. The best seating is at the bar where you can banter with the bartenders and be baffled by their bottlework (or just stare at the bottles; whatever takes your fancy).

I've had negroni, old fashioned, and gin + tonic here and they are all exceptional executions of classic cocktails.

Warning 1: There's a $250 Gin + Tonic on the menu, be careful you don't order that unless you really mean to order that!

Warning 2: The beetroot chips are seriously addictive and whenever you get low they'll refill these and you may lose track of just how many you have. You've been warned!

Warning 3: The cocktails are well-balanced, but boozy, meaning you won't be able to tell they have a whack in them. When you stand up, you may find yourself wobblier than a busted bike wheel, so please do attempt to retain your dignity by walking slowly towards the exit. 

Highly Recommended for the Gin fanatics out there (They currently have the world's largest hand-curated collection of gin, consisting of over 1,000 bottles).",1/12/2019,Food & Beverage
ATLAS,4,"The place was within walking distance from the MRT station. Although it was weekday, the place enjoyed a healthy flow of customers. For the 3 of us, we were showed to a table with a sofa and 2 armchairs. After looking through the menu, we decided on the 3 course lunch set(S$48++). Still and sparkling water was chargeable at S$2++ per person.

For the starters :
'cavolo monachina' green cabbage, pine nuts, raisin, anchovies (S$20++)
Savoury cabbage which reminded one of chinese style braised vegetable filling for spring roll, with the nuts giving it texture. 

'frittata di pasta' spaghetti and eggs, broccoli rabe, sausage (S$22++)
It was like a pancake made of spaghetti and eggs, topped with broccoli and slices of sausage. Slightly dry but flavourful.

'uova in purgatorio' tomato soup and runny egg yolk... in the shell (S$18++) 
The dish was served in egg shells which were held upright by salt, accompanied with buttery soft toast soldiers. Underneath the foam, was the tomato soup, packed with mouthfuls of vegetables, plus the egg yolk right below. It kind of balance the sour taste of the tomato soup.

For mains : 
'baccala' salted cod, gaeta olives , capsicum neapolitan style (S$29++)
Light battered fish, which tasted slightly salty but firm and meaty. 

braised lamb, green peas, zucchini, fresh mint 'alla scapece' (S$30++)
The lamb was quite tender and sliced easily. None of the gamey taste but it was bit too heavily flavoured. 

maine lobster roll, artisanal brioche bun, marie rose dressing (S$30++)
Topup S$4++ for set 
The bun looked kind of hard but it was lightly crispy and buttery. Stuffed with finely chopped pickled vegetables and juicy lobster meat, it was quite appetizing. 

Lastly the desserts : 
'baba' infused with frangelico liqueur, whipped mascarpone cream (S$14++)
The baba were cute little buns which were soft and moist. Could not get enough of them.

fried 'struffoli' dough, honey and cinnamon parfait (S$14++) 
Light crispy puffs paired with ice cream.

ATLAS signature madeleines, jam and chantilly cream (S$14++) 
It looked simple, but I was blown off by the lemony moist texture.",20/2/2018,Food & Beverage

I came here for dinner. The drinks and food here are really pricey but that is expected coming to a venue like this. I ordered the cod and the truffle pasta special. The food was good    and not amazing. The portion size is on the small side so you will need to order more than a main to feel full.

As always what others say, the Great Gatsby feel here is strong.

They have some complimentary great popcorn, but where else can you get some delish madeleines at 12 midnight?

Drinks here are good and quite strong, but for the price you expect them to be. The one thing this place lacks is a personal touch, even seated at the bar. Due to the size of this place, that's probably why.

You'll probably have to wait a while if you don't have a reservation, but once you're seated you will be able to relax with plenty of elbow space. I came here on a weekend in a group of 5 and waited over an hour to be seated.

ATLAS is an experience.  The interior itself is one of the most beautiful interiors I've ever seen, in a bar or otherwise, and it's easily worth whatever price of admission.  The service is phenomenal, the food is phenomenal, the drinks are phenomenal.  Everything oozes class and character in a manner which simply cannot be undersold - it's breathtaking.

Of course, with this experience comes a caveat: cost.  This place isn't cheap, and the argument could be made that the drinks and food aren't as good as the price commands.  With that said, I'm inclined to say that the entire package is worth the high price - even if the drinks weren't the best I've ever had by any stretch, the overall atmosphere and experience made them feel like it.",12/1/2018,Food & Beverage

I was there In the afternoon and had no problem finding a seat. However, I heard this place gets very crowded at night time (vibe is different as well) and hard to make a reservation. If you are in Singapore  only for a few days, would recommend to go in the afternoon.",26/10/2018,Food & Beverage
ATLAS,3,"Update: I finally found myself wearing acceptable attire to be allowed admission into the bar. Staff were super preoccupied, but when I caught their attention they were friendly. Drinks are interesting and well made, and the atmosphere inarguably transports you to Gatsby. The staff offered me a petting aperitif before I left, as they were entertaining a large group at the bar. It was a nice gesture given their preoccupation with the large, clearly more jovial patrons. IF you find yourself in ArtDecoWear and there's a spot readily available, I'd say it's worth a stop. 

If you like pretentious bars with mediocre drinks in a fantastic Art Deco setting, this is your place. If you love great drinks and good company, there are too many other places in Singapore... don't waste your time here.",8/2/2018,Food & Beverage
ATLAS,3,"The renewed Atlas bar is like a Tinder date: the idea sounds great: you go for the looks and the first impression is amazing but ultimately it is a disappointment.

This bar looks fantastic, the building and interior is really impressive (think art-deco Great Gatsby style), I was truly wow-ed by the atmosphere at first sight but as the night progressed, the swinging music changed into a random mix of depressing tracks. 

The menu has quite some cocktails, some will set you back $200++ but since I still wanted to eat the remainder of the week, my friend and I went for the Atlas signature martini. Not bad, plus the glass was very pretty however I prefer a regular dirty martini. For my second drink I had a glass of Pinot Noir which was not bad either but I would have preferred to see more classic cocktails on the menu, as I am a classics girl and I also feel it would go well with the theme.

As for the service.... I cannot say anything more than that it is a plain disappointment. We had to wave down the waitress several times, our water was never topped up (and they charge $2++ for ""free"" flow water) and none of the staff made us feel really welcome. If I pay almost 75$ a person for two drinks and a cheese plate I do expect good service!

In short: go for the interior, snap some pictures but don't expect anything more.",9/3/2017,Food & Beverage
ATLAS,3,"The ambiance is great, but with the capacity so small, it makes getting a seat difficult, even at the bar.

ATLAS,4,"Gorgeous decor, which is the whole hype of this place! The tea set and cocktails were very yummy. Service was below average though, rather inattentive, didn't feel worthy of a top tier bar. For a bar that boasts being one of the best in the world, I would love to see the waiters being more engaged with the guests providing cocktail recommendations and sharing what the bar has to offer. They were also vacuuming and storing things behind our table while we and many other customers were still there, which was odd.",6/1/2022,Food & Beverage

ATLAS,5,"A bar I'd been wanting to try for awhile cause fancy gin cocktails are my thing, and somehow I ended up in a hotel right across the street at Bugis.  Inside the ""Gotham City Building"", the decor inside Atlas fits the nickname of the building.  Actually, the interiors reminded me of the art deco (?) style of the building that houses Yelp in San Francisco.  Just gorgeous.  We came here late on a weeknight and it was packed, though we were able to find spots at the bar.  Lots of cozy seating not at the bar too.  Great gin drinks, free popcorn, nice bartenders.  The food looked delish too.  I'll come back next time I'm in town!",3/11/2018,Food & Beverage

ATLAS,5,"Atlas is a swanky newish bar near Bugis, which is quite dramatic in a number of ways.  As you enter the art deco space, you feel like you are in NYC and not in Singapore, and the space is amazing. There are liquor bottles stacked on shelves that can be accessed only by ladders.  There is a champagne room as well where they store their extensive selection.  Menu-wise, the focus here is on gin and champagne, although they have a decent selection of whiskey and other booze as well.  And personally, it's the only place in town with a decent selection of genever - most bars would be lucky to have a single bottle, but here there are probably over 50 different bottles!  The total tally for gin is over 1,000 different bottles from around the globe.  The bartenders are quite good, with a few I recognized from other great Singapore bars such as Anti:dote.  It is a bit more formal here, and even for an open bar seat, you do need to check in with the host.   I've always gone early though so getting a seat hasn't been a problem, although I can imagine this place getting packed later in the evening.  But with the great selection of genever, I am already a regular and it's well worth a visit!",30/12/2017,Food & Beverage
ATLAS,1,"The waitress called her manager to confirm if she can let us in. The woman came out and gave a look at us from head to toe. (We both had black dresses and flats.)

Bar Stories,5,"I don't drink. Unless its half a glass of Red Wine. I don't drink. Unless worst case scenario, its a very special occasion and I should be toasting with family and friends. I don't drink. Unless I'm at Bar Stories.

THIS IS THE COOLEST PLACE EVER.

I've actually added it to the top of everyones lists of places to go when visiting Singapore. This is where I want to have every first date because its just such an awesome concept. You literally can request your hearts desire of a cocktail and have it made for you right in front of your eyes. Its such a wonderful experience because it allows you to get creative and feel like you've somehow involved yourself in the creation that the extremely talented individuals here have mustered up for you by calling out a theme.

The only downside would be that the drinks take a while to make, but you can watch them do it in awe, and to be honest, its an excuse for me to drink slower, hah! Also you can see the love and time they put into making the masterpiece which is your drink and watch everyone else's faces light up in receiving their own godly creation.

The staff there are so friendly, daring you on to do your worst as if they're just bursting to come up with something new. And when they did make the cocktails, most of the time it was something completely innovative that they had just come up with on the spot. Very impressive!

The flavours we had last time were.. Something Chocolatey (served in an actually Nutella jar!), Something with Pineapple, Strawberry and White Chocolate (my favourite flavours and actually the best cocktail of my life), Fruity with fire (and fire there was), Lychee Champagne, and Peanut Butter (which turned into Peanut butter with a shot of jelly grape liquor which was DELICIOUS - also a mahoosive pink pocky stick was added to the mix - presentation is on point here!).

The following time I had come, I was the first to arrive and I got to come around the bar and shake a drink (so sorry to the poor guy at the receiving end of that one) which was sweet. That time I got given this chocolate concoction surrounded by chocolate sauce, ice cream and chocolate biscuits. Have a look at the photo - CRAZY!

Next time I'll be back with better flavours.. I've got something with Cheesecake up my sleeve..",19/3/2015,Food & Beverage

Bar Stories,4,"Let me start by saying, if a guy brought me here on a first date, I'd be more than impressed. 

Hidden amongst Hookah bars and cool hipster shops on Haji Lane lies this little gem... A cocktail-only bar, Bar Stories doesn't come with a menu, nope! Just creative mixologists, who take a few moments to talk to you about 'your perfect cocktail' and then whip it up for you.

For my first drink, I asked for something subtly sweet/sour, but not overly sweet. I ended up getting a concoction that involved berries and a mini ice sculpture. For my second, I wanted something chocolate-y and pretty. Yet, strong. I ended up getting the most delicious alcoholic dessert in a cup, exactly what I was looking for. It involved nutella, dark rum and a bunch of other things accompanied by a green tea chocolate wafer biscuit and a nutella spread cracker on the side. It hit the spot. 

Granted, service is a little slow... but only because they take a lot of time to make each drink super special. My advice, come with a girlfriend and sit at the bar. And then enjoy a few cocktails (at $25 per drink) over a night of catching up or getting to know someone.

4 stars instead of 5 only because I wish they served alcohol on the rocks on the side too. I know it's a cocktail-only concept but it makes it kind of hard if you're in a group and one or two people don't drink cocktails/mixed drinks at all (like most guys don't). Otherwise, love this bar.

Climb upstairs, take one of of the bar stools if available (undoubtably the best seats in the house) and befriend one of the friendly story tellers, aka bar tenders. Don't expect a menu, but do expect to be asked if you're in a sweet, spicy, bitter or herbal mood. And expect to be impressed. And possibly on fire, should that be the adventure you choose...",8/4/2013,Food & Beverage
Bar Stories,5,"Love, love, love the concept! But word on the street and actual reality is a wee bit different. So the tour guide who told us about this bar said the concept was based around telling the bartender your life story and he would make a cocktail for you, based on your life story. Reality is that he comes and consults with you on the flavours and tastes you like (sweet, sour, spicy, etc) and then suggests a cocktail based on your answers.  You can veto his suggestions, if as an example you don't like the fact that gin is involved, but hey, would you tell Michelangelo how to paint?

All of 6 of us just had a great evening and there were some great surprises when the drinks finally came out (we all tasted each others). My fave was this amazing cardamom gin that tasted incredible, as will as this non-alcoholic cranberry drink that had a chili kick at the end. Prices were totally dependent on the alcohol involved - the cocktails ranged from S$20-35 and the mocktails were from S$10-15.

Appetizers were different - Shimeiji Fries which we thought were tasty but wished for the Cilantro Calamansi mayo to have more cilantro and calamansi...but still delightful. 

The Seabass Pate was pleasant.

Curried Mussels - a big hit! We note that their sauces and blended gravies are super tasty - wish we had more mantou to schlepp it up with!

Charred Golden Pomfret - had a certain homey (Singapore momma cooking kind of homey) taste to it which tantalized my taste buds and my memories. Loved it. It's a keeper for the menu.

Bar Stories,3,"The cocktail bar of choice for the upper middle class CMEL crowd (Chinese, middle class, English speaking liberal). At least for a while. BarStories is pretty. Very pretty. It's got this beautiful, sophisticated furniture all over. A beautiful bar. Ample seating, which is rare to come by sometimes in places like these. It's also very popular, clearly, for good reasons.

Yet I can't help but feel the drinks are rather hit or miss. I understand they take their mixology very seriously and like at everywhere else, I entrust the satiation of my thirst to them to do whatever they heck they want. 

Half the time the drinks have been above average, but never great (hard to justify this sort of prices, esp now that they have soooo many worthy competitors). The other half of the time the drinks have just been downright abysmal.

It's very pricey, even in the greater scheme of pricey cocktail bars, and I can't quite justify coming back too often unless there's an occasion or person that calls for more style over substance.. which is rarely.",8/8/2012,Food & Beverage

I'm gonna research my next choices and arrive prepared on the next  order.

Bar Stories,3,"If you are looking for traditional cocktails, this is not the place. They do it too, but they like to do things with a twist. No fixed menu, no fixed mixologist.

My first time here was a busy Sat night. Even though we were there nearly at midnight, the place was busy, much too busy for the staff to cope. We ordered and waited, checked with the server and waited some more, and waited. The server ended up giving us a free shot of shoju each (which was nice..but we were really thirsty for our drinks!). We ended up getting our first drinks 1.15 hr later!

The next few times were pre-dinner drinks, so it was much better. and we got a seat at the bar, which guaranteed immediate attention. 

Drinks here are fancy...and sometimes a little too sweet for our liking. The place is homely and nice, with exposed brick walls and nice couches. Plus, it is set in a shophouse in the cool Haji Lane. To my angmo friends, it felt like their homes.

They used to be impossible to get into without a reservation and I'm happy to report that when I visited at 9 on a Friday, we were seated right away.

Since every cocktail is made to order, it's nice how they take the time to listen to your preferences and make something you'll enjoy. Just be quite specific about what you like so they can include all those elements. I find that they do very well with their fruit forward cocktails and have a penchant for burning herbs for that smoky flavor.

This ultra-personalisation comes at a hefty price, alongside very slow service. The poor bartenders were completely rammed on the Saturday night, and seemed a little stressed out. We couldn't get another order in and - given every cocktail order was meant to be a cheerful negotiation - having cocktail makers who are overloaded makes the whole experience less pleasant.

Bar Stories,4,"Had a great time at this place. Always love finding a place with well-mixed cocktails, where the bartenders do actually care about what they're creating, and not just making a few bucks between here and grad school.

Few disclaimers:
1. We went on a Sunday night, and there were only 6 people in the entire place.
2. It was on a business trip...so we weren't so concerned with the price

Menu
There's no menu as some of the other reviews mentioned, so you'll start by telling the bartender (""mixologist"" if you're fancy) the flavors you like, and the liquor. Let them know if you want something sweet or a bit more boozey too.  That will help you out. If you don't like your first cocktail - tell them what you didn't like. They're not offended, but will use that info to make you something better for round two.

Atmosphere
I'm not sure the name of our bartender, but we had a good time hanging out at the bar.  They're great to talk with...especially if you're a fan of a well-mixed cocktail.  The place is cozy - kind of at a random spot hidden in Haji Lane, but as some other reviewers mentioned, it's very small.  Probably would impact service, especially because all of the drinks are unique in some way. It's a low-key place too...rustic modern, so wear your skinny jeans and a button down with suede shoes. You'll fit right in haha. Just kidding - wear whatever you want. It's not a pretentious place.

I have a few survival tips to get good treatment at this bar.
1. Don't order a classic cocktail. You can tell them you like the flavors in a gin and tonic, but what's the point of going to a bar like this and ordering something you could get at every bar in the world? Let them do what they do best - create cocktails.
2. Don't order anything with vodka. I personally don't drink vodka, and I don't have anything against it...but in the craft cocktail world, nothing makes a bartender's eyes roll than when you ask for vodka.

Looking for adventure? Tell them you like spice. If you're never had a cocktail with muddled thai chilis, you should try one ASAP.",21/11/2012,Food & Beverage

Bar Stories,4,"Bar stories is clearly on of my favorite bars in Singapore. They are located on the 2nd floor of a building on the trendy Haji Lane in the Arab district. It is recommended to make reservations to be sure to get a spot here. I would also recommend bringing some extra clothes as they have really cranked up the air condition so irrespective of how warm it may be outside it is still chilly inside.

Once seated the friendly staff will discuss a bit what you like and what type of flavors you would like in your cocktail. I usually opt for something rum based and fresh and did so here as well. They also made sure to ask if there were any allergies or things we disliked and then they go to work. It seems they are fairly creative and they use a lot of fresh herbs and fruits.

I was very happy with my cocktail and so were all the others we were there with. Together with Long Play this would be my go to place on Haji Lane.",11/1/2016,Food & Beverage
Bar Stories,3,"So no-menu bespoke cocktail bars are cropping up all over the city, and of course I have to visit them all.

Bar stories looked promising. In fact, the decor is remiscent of Maison Ikkoku which is another up and coming bar (some would even say it has arrived). We asked for drinks with pretty specific flavour profiles, and we got something that might have been acceptable, if not so watered down. It just had no soul - pardon my analogy - but like a brown girl trying to rap. Both our drinks.. it was a bit sad. 

But we persevered on and this time asked a different guy at the bar to make our drinks. Looks like the trick worked - the kaffir lime/grapefruit tequila sour that I got was was excellent - a salty bitterness to the drink, plenty of acid and complexity. My husband asked for a penicillin which was all smoke and no fire. They did serve it with an interesting garnish though: an orange slice with 8 clove buds set on fire with a brulee torch. It added a wonderful nose to the drink.. but didn't make up for its obvious flaws. My drink too came with the kaffir lime being bruleed - I guess the folks at Bar stories share my love for the flame torch.

But this is 2013 and Bar Stories has been eclipsed by the likes of Jigger & Pony, Horse's Mouth, Cufflink Club, etc. The drinks just aren't that great and they have a habit of making embarrassing missteps, like serving cocktails in martini glasses that have not been chilled properly.

Also, the ""no menu"" bullshit is starting to wear thin and if you want to be a specialist cocktail bar it is totally unforgivable that you only have two single malt whiskeys available on any given night. That there is shameful.

Moreover, you might offer patrons drinks with no name based on a flavour or a base spirit preference but if I order an old fashioned or a bloody mary and you don't execute well... why should I trust you with a random fruity concoction?

Sorry Bar Stories, every time I've been here I've been underwhelmed by the drinks and raised one eyebrow at ""the experience"". If friends drag me back here now I just order Macallan 12 on the rocks.

Bar Stories,4,"I've gone a few times and had dramatically different experiences. I've had 5 star experiences and 2 star, so overall 4 stars seems to make sense. So the general jist of the place is you go in and you get asked a few questions about your drink preferences and the bar tenders come up with something.

So first, for my positive experiences, I've always sat at the bar and it has been on slower nights (Tuesdays and Thursdays usually from my experience). Actually getting to interact with the bartenders as they make your drinks really makes the experience worthwhile. They actually pry further into what you like and you get to watch all the theatrics that go into making the drinks. The ""wow"" factor is pretty big when you get your super elaborate drinks. From the service pieces (everything from martini glasses to mason jars), to garnishes (candy, smoke, foams, etc), to pyrotechnics, it's all pretty impressive. And the drinks do actually taste quite nice, and it's not all just a show.

So my more negative experiences have been on busy nights seated at a table. For one, the waiters usually don't try as hard at getting to know your drink preferences as the actual bar tenders. The wait time for the drinks is SUPER long. Finally, what sucks the most is when they get backed up they put FAR less effort into your cocktail. Basically you usually end up with a fruity martini or the likes - not necessarily bad, but just disappointing.

At over $20 a drink, the former experience I mentioned felt worth it, but the latter felt like a rip off. So if you can catch the place on a slow night I highly recommend it, but if it's busy pass for a different night.",23/1/2014,Food & Beverage
Bar Stories,5,"After my poor experience at Maison Ikkoku, Chris A. and I wandered over to Bar Stories. Our verdict? Much better! The atmosphere was more relaxed and not as pretentious.

I came here again tonight with a few girlfriends and the bartenders truly took time to make our drinks extra special, from an ice sculpture to burning a rosemary candle! Our server also came by to shine a flashlight so we had proper lightening for pictures...thank you!

I do prefer the drinks at Maison Ikkoku though since they tend to be stronger. BUT, Bar Stories takes reservations on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, unlike Maison Ikkoku. Price point wise are about the same, roughly $25 per drink.

Bar Stories,5,"Bar stories ranks perhaps as my number one cocktail bar in Singapore (maybe even the world). If you would ask my husband, he would prefer Longplay, but I am sure this place would not be long behind.

Bar stories is located on Haji lane, a street where the Western and Middle-Eastern cultures collide. There are many bars around with tourists and expats having drinks, but also bars that serve no alcohol to respect the Arab-heritage. Bar stories is located in the upstair of an old shop-house. Its not a speakeasy per-se, but it is not something you wonder into without knowing what it is. 

Upon entering we were greeted and seated at the end of the bar. I love a seat with a view! The concept was as in Bitters & Love, there is no menu, you explain to the bartender what you like and they will make you a drink. We went with our usual spirits of choice, me wit gin and my date with a dark rum. We are perhaps a bit boring, but it helps compare. Also I am really not fond of whiskey, cognac or vodka as a base. The bartender also asked some questions like do I like lemongrass and could I handle some egg white in my drink (YES!). 

I could already see from the equipment they had at hand that we were going to see some party tricks. I don't mind as long as my drink is good. My dates cocktail arrived with a flaming branch or rosemary, and mine with a long lemongrass sticking out of the Martini glass. Looking around others had pretty cool looking drinks as well, and none of them looked the same. The staff seemed to like experimenting and you could see they were having fun with it. The taste was wonderful, like a mix of a fresh breeze and dessert (due to the creaminess of the egg white) with spices on top. 

We only had one round of drinks this time, but I can imagine I could have sat there sipping on cocktails for a full evening. The ambience was charming and relaxed and the cocktails excellent. As with many nice bars these days, it is possible to reserve a table (I remember the days in Finland when it cost something and you only got a crappy bottle of Absolute Vodka and some mixers as ""compensation""). There doesn't seem to be any food or snacks, so my recommendation would be to have dinner before going.

Bar Stories,5,"Easily the best experimental cocktail bar in Singapore.

Never have I encountered a guy like this bartender Zack that just totally nails every drink. Completely random creations that he turns into an art. 

We made reservations for 2 for this cool place on Haji Lane, walked up the stairs and sat down in front of this cool lookin dude that looks like a mad genius. He asks us our names and what we like. He asked what flavors we wanted and we were off. There is an array of fresh local fruits and flavors to choose from.

I remember getting some cool version of the negroni with his twist on it. My girlfriend got a lemongrass tea cocktail with tequila. Not only were the drinks excellent and beyond creative, but so was the presentation. Hers came in a tea pot with a mini tea cup. Mine was a cool glass that I can't describe. So much detail involved with flavor that you just will not find anywhere else in the world. That's the beauty of this place.

The setting is a bit cramped but otherwise this place deserves all the praise it can get. Highly recommend for a date or hanging out with friends. I will be back.",9/9/2015,Food & Beverage
Bar Stories,4,"You know when you're growing up and you always had a friend who had an effortlessly cool older brother or sister? Just being in their presence made you feel gawky and awkward.

Well Singapore bars, your uber hip older sibling has just arrived on the scene. Bar Stories sits on Haji Lane amongst the quirky/independent shops that are growing in number there. 

It's small, intimate and incredibly welcoming. Something not a lot of the 'cool' bars in Singapore can pull off. There is no menu, so everyone is treated to a personal cocktail consultation when they arrive, asking you whether you prefer sweet or sour, fruity, strong flavors etc until they have an idea of your palate tastes.

You can then sit and watch as great care is taken over the mix and the presentation of your drink, they are served in a wide variety of glasses, jars, bottles to make you feel very special. My drinking partner's whiskey based cocktail for example came complete with a beautiful small paper boat containing some crystallized ginger.

The ambiance and background music have been carefully chosen to compliment the experience. I'd highly recommend this to bring a date to impress him or her, for a celebratory outing or just anytime you want something personal, to feel special and to unwind after a long day.",1/11/2013,Food & Beverage
Bar Stories,4,"Be sure to stop by this bar on Haji Lane if you like unique cocktails.  It is not a fancy bar, by any means, but the cocktails are!  There is no menu - you just tell the bartender what type of drinks you prefer and what liquor to use and he concocts a delicicous and fun cocktail!",21/8/2018,Food & Beverage
Bar Stories,3,"Nice cosy environment, the drinks here are really quite pricey but if you chat up the bartender properly, he'll mix you up something interesting depending on what your taste is. I went for sweet and had a strawberry cheesecake that tasted disconcertingly like cake! Still, rather pricey and not something you can indulge in all the time.",31/8/2012,Food & Beverage
Bar Stories,4,"The Art of Mixology is something Bar Stories has truly become a master of. My first experience with Bar Stories was about a year ago and I have not stopped coming back since!

From the minute you enter, Bar Stories is an experience. Each Bartender is an expert in mixology and, surprisingly, in your tastes. You won't the regular after work drinks here, or even a menu for them. You'll be asked what your favorite flavors are, whether you like sweet or sour, what your preferred liquor is, and how strong you'd like your drink to be. 

The staff are extremely friendly and you wont find yourself without conversation while you watch the mixologists get to work.  There is also a short food menu with a few bites to nibble on while you wait for your drinks.The drinks themselves are delicious, my current favorite is A Trip To Japan. 

A little bit on the pricey side, the drinks can range from $20-$25 a pop. Perfect for an after work drink!",14/8/2012,Food & Beverage
Bar Stories,3,"I'd been interested in visiting Bar Stories after hearing about bespoke cocktails and was finally able to drop by. 

We were pretty useless at ordering because we aren't usually cocktail drinkers, so we didn't know what to say about ""taste profiles"". I ended up asking for something vodka-based and sweet, while my fiancé asked for something like a White Russian. 

I don't know what we eventually for, except that they were both tasty. Another mixologist explained what he was making to some other customers but our mixologist didn't really tell us. I suppose it's not that big a deal; we enjoyed our drinks anyway. 

The bill came up to around $51 for the two of us so do be prepared for that (alcohol isn't cheap in Singapore anyway). I don't think I'll visit again, but it's definitely a nice place to go with friends and enjoy the surprise of a customised drink!",19/6/2014,Food & Beverage

Bar Stories,5,"Whether you are a local or just traveling in Singapore, visiting Bar Stories is a must. There is no menu and instead, you get the unique experience of describing the flavors you like and the bartenders will make a custom drink for you. Everything from the flavors to the presentation is exceptional. The two bartenders we met were very friendly and helped us brainstorm drink ideas. I asked for something fruity with clear alcohol and spice. I was given a lychee and sour plum drink with a chili pepper and it was phenomenal- one of the best cocktails I've ever had. I also had a raspberry, ginger, and basil cocktail that was really good. My boyfriend had a Penicillin- a smokey whiskey drink and then had a passion fruit whiskey-based cocktail with rhubarb bitters that he thoroughly enjoyed. Based off my visit, we paid about $22-$25 per drink plus tax and a service charge, but it is well worth it considering the high quality of the beverages and how expensive alcohol is in Singapore to begin with. 

TLDR: DELICIOUS. GET THERE.",9/1/2017,Food & Beverage
Bar Stories,5,"A very unique place that should be on anyones must visit list; well, almost anyone, some friends I took listened to the introduction, then asked for beers on tap and a wine list, they aren't the target audience.
The concept with this bar is no menus, just a discussion with the bartender and a customized drink is brought out for you. In my many visits here I have only had one less than stellar visit and that was because our particular bartender that night, just didn't interact well with us, not fun, good drinks, but not exciting. Every other visit is fun with the bartender discussing your tastes and pushing you to try something new and expand your tastes.
The service is above and beyond, in fact, one visit my wife was explaining that she doesn't like Gin, and a voice from across the room yelled out ""You do too, like Gin, the last two times you were here I served you Gin"" Two things about this, 1) We are not THAT regular, but they remembered us 2) They push you to try new things that even you don't realize you like. 
The drinks are not just mixed cocktails, but they are complete experiences, a table of four will likely have something flaming, some herb or unique fruit and maybe even a merengue. 
No two visits are the same and no two drinks are the same, it is a great experience and definitely a place to go with friends you will share drinks with to try it all.

PS: I do advise making reservations, we have been lucky just walking up, but making a reservation ahead is advisable and allows you to request a bar seat which is the best experience.",24/3/2015,Food & Beverage
Bar Stories,5,"Apart from the wait, the service was pretty good with creative drinks ideas. The bartenders are friendly and helpful if you are unsure of what to order. I didn't mind the wait as I get to witness the drinks being made on the spot. Pretty good for those who are indecisive and who love surprises. Well recommended for those who are on a date. I love the cozy ambience of the place. It fits well for couples. Alcoholic drinks and non-alcoholic drinks are charged at $22 and $10 respectively excluding service charge.",21/4/2015,Food & Beverage
Bar Stories,5,"What a neat little gem! A friend from the U.S. Visited Bar Stories last year. I have wanted to go ever since. I absolutely adore the concept! They do not have a menu. They ask you some questions to try to figure out your tastes and make you a custom, personalised cocktail! We went to Bar Stories on a Thursday evening around 9:00. They were full, but they accommodated us by putting us at a big shared table. The staff was very friendly and attentive. It did take a long time to actually receive our drinks, but that is understandable. Each cocktail is crafted to beautiful perfection. My husband had a whiskey, lemon grass and walnut martini. I had a mint grape Bellini. Both of the drinks were beautiful and tasted great as well! In the future we will make reservations.  I think this would be a great place to take visiting friends. It us pricey, but worth the experience. We went back to Bar Stories and had the opportunity to sit at the bar. The bar tender has an awesome personality and we loved watching him create art. The drinks at Bar Stories are truly art!",9/8/2015,Food & Beverage
Bar Stories,1,"Been to Bar stories many times, and used to ends up being a very memorable experience. Chic setting, great bar counter, and chatty bartenders spinning up very creative drinks... a visual delight and great tasting cocktails!
HOWEVER...changes in staff? and or management? or just the attitude... makes this the worst place to step into.

For us, a hope for great evening hosting a visiting friend turned into a nightmare. First, the bartender was plain rude, refusing to seat us by the bar counter. Why - some (new, and very random) rule about not letting over 3 people of a group at the bar. Thats ok...if it's a fairly busy time. This was monday evening..and with literally 2-4 other customers during the entire time! so we were sent packing to a dingy corner, away from the action and fun. This 'rule' was visibly random, targeted, and new for us regulars who have enjoyed multiple fun nights at the bar counter, in more crowded nights, and in larger numbers. But hey, who are we to say...just customers (which means nothing to the 'cool n chic' bar stories staff)

Then came the order taking...also usually a delightful process of interaction with the (used to be) social, friendly staff. This guy chose to take our orders from his pedestal at the bar counter, several feet away from us. Upon requesting politely, he obliged to come closer to us to have a 'conversation' as the order process here tends to be.

Next on delivering the cocktails...he concocted and brought the first ones out. Now, to the very common, and genuine qn from my friend ""is this mine?"" (bcos you dont know what shape, color, or style your drink at bar stories could be..thats part of the 'fun', the bartenders response was 'why would i put it in front of you otherwise?!' (Paraphrased, but only a soft attempt to recreate the curt reply that left a bad taste, before the first sip went in!

I used to say expensive, but great drinks and great experience makes this worth a trip. Now it is just expensive.",30/9/2014,Food & Beverage
Bar Stories,5,"It was my first time here and I loved it! Come in, tell them what flavors you like and bam!, you get a wonderful cocktail. Just like magic!  You can stay in the homey bar if you need to cool off, but I prefer to sit outside on Haji Street for some interesting people watching and to check out the colorful storefronts!  If ever in Singapore again, I would stop by for a cocktail...they are worth the $22 each :)",9/11/2013,Food & Beverage
Bar Stories,1,Terrible service from the Malay male bartender. Drink was bad (too sour) and he overcompensated by pouring too much syrup to balance it out.

Jigger and Pony,5,"Visited Jigger and Pony in Singapore for the first time in June 2024. Made an evening reservation online a couple weeks in advance for a party of 4. The venue is located inside of the Amara hotel and was easy to find from the lobby. I had very high expectations for visiting Jigger and Pony which was ranked the #2 bar in Asia. The service, drinks, and overall vibes of the bar completely exceeded my expectations! Our host was Aldrich who was honestly one of the best we have ever had. He was super fun, knowledgeable, and went above and beyond multiple times. From providing us birthday shots for one of our party members, to providing recommendations around the area, to even getting us signed copies of their most recent cocktail menu from their staff, he truly made our experience incredible! The cocktails were so good as well. My party had extensively explored many of the top bars around Hong Kong and Singapore and my favorite by far was Jigger and Pony. The team there is amazing and I recommend anyone in the area to pay them a visit!",11/7/2024,Food & Beverage
Jigger and Pony,5,"I made a reservation far far in advance of my visit to Singapore and Jigger and Pony has really raised the gold standard for cocktail bars.

The ambiance is lounge-y and very cool. The service is impeccable, our server Eldridge really took care of us. The drinks were unbelievably delicious. Eldridge talked us through the menu, and as a big fan of Whisky, I started with The Godfather. A drink so delicious, I'm going to have dreams about it, until my next trip! 

Up next? Tequila, but of course. I ordered the White Toreador. An excellent drink, but now I kind of wish I ordered The Godfather again, lol.

I can't wait to come back. It's a pity it won't be for another year!",25/7/2023,Food & Beverage
Jigger and Pony,4,"Cute spot! We had to wait about 45mins for a group of 6. It's in a hotel lobby so we chilled there. They don't really take your number so we primarily stayed there. The host did suggest us to check out another bar, but unfortunately the ones that were close by were closing soon.

Upon walking in (up the stairs), the atmosphere was dim and loungey. There are a lot of communal tables, a bar area, and small tables for the different groups. It doesn't seem like a place to go alone (more for groups). We were in the back and by the AC so it was very cold. We didn't know this until the end, but you can request blankets. And you should because they were comfy.

When you are seated, you have the menus with a variety of cocktails and yummy chips. The menu has a fun map where you can answer questions and it'll suggest a cocktail for you

Drinks were yummy!",23/6/2023,Food & Beverage
Jigger and Pony,5,"Came here for happy hour with reservation. The yuzu whiskey sour was good but negroni was even better (balanced, abundance of herbal undertones and exquisite taste).

Jigger and Pony,5,I read this place was ranked in the top 50 best bars in the world so I figured I needed to give it a try. I tried the Yuzu Whiskey Sour which was incredible. Highly recommend! I also tried an old fashioned. Either of those you can't go wrong with but definitely try the Yuzu Whiskey Sour since you don't see that on the menu in other places in the world. Also if you're hungry go for the bikini sandwich. If you like truffle you will love this. Overall very cool spot and I would love to return.,6/12/2023,Food & Beverage
Jigger and Pony,4,"Great speakeasy with a nice atmosphere that's comfortable and spacious with art deco vibes. We were excited to try this bar after seeing it on the 50 best bars list and came to check this out on our recent trip to Singapore. Their menu puts a twist to classic cocktails and we love looking through the booklet which acts as a menu with a background on each drink.

We're not heavy drinkers so stuck with the lighter cocktails. We got the yuzu whisky sour with the corn colada for round 1. I really loved the whisky sour but the corn colada lacked the corn punch I expected from trying other corn-based cocktails in the past. It tasted mostly of pineapple but did have a buttery taste similar to popcorn. We also tried the jasmine rice which was good but didn't have much jasmine flavor. 

Overall, a nice spot to go to with friends. It's fun and ritzy without being too stuffy which is great.",29/11/2022,Food & Beverage
Jigger and Pony,4,"Currently on the World's 50 Best Bars at #12 and Asia's 50 Best Bars at #2.

Located in the Amara hotel right off the main lobby. The bar area is dimly lit for that vibey atmosphere. A hostess greets you and there's some lounge corners, a long communal table, the bar, and some additional seating a few stairs up. I recommend making a reservation if you're able to. Each cocktail is $28 SGD and then with service charge, GST fees, $33+ SGD per drink, so a pretty penny. 

For a group of two coming at 7:30PM on a Wednesday, it was quite packed, but we were able to get a couple of seats at the bar. The menu is designed like a magazine for each drink and the front page has the table of contents in a grid table with the lightest alcohol content (or mocktails) on the top row to the highest percentage on the last. Then the columns I think are based on specific taste preference like sweet, sour, etc. 

Our server Gerald was amazing - friendly, knowledgeable, and good conversation! Everyone was very friendly and seeing the bartenders do their craft was really fun.

We tried Soy Milk Punch, Godfather, Greatest of All Time, and Ramos Gin Fizz. I like the Soy Milk Punch the best with the egg white foam top which was delicious.

We wanted to try some of the food items but we're running on a tight schedule. Definitely a spot for elevated cocktails and good vibes to hang out with friends in Singapore!",1/6/2023,Food & Beverage

Their atmosphere is energetic and creates for excellent people watching. My only potential note would be that they keep it cold. Not cool, cold. They do offer shaws and blankets if necessary.

The service is friendly and willing to give you your space or tell you some history and provide in depth drink recommendations. They will even speak of how the drink flavors linger, which may have you adjust your order sequence.",31/10/2024,Food & Beverage

Not too sure why it has such a highly regarded bar in the world but the service is definitely top notch.  The crowd is on the younger side and there was plenty of seating.  I ordered a Mojito and it tasted a little off.  Maybe this was not the drink of choice.,10/5/2025,Food & Beverage
Jigger and Pony,4,"Jigger & Pony has the #5 spot on The World's 50 Best Bars list, so when we found ourselves staying a short walk away, we decided to check it out. The place takes reservations, and we grabbed the only one available, for a midnight seating. Crazytown for a couple of middle-aged parents, but we were only in Singapore for one night. We napped during the day and showed up ten minutes early.

The bar was on the lobby level of the Amara hotel, and we were welcomed in as soon as we arrived. It was a fun spot, attractive and lively, definitely a scene. I appreciated that the reservation came with seating, two stools right at the bar. There were three or four bartenders behind there at any given time, and they were young and friendly and seemed to be having a blast. I really liked the guy making our drinks, a sweet Korean dude who's lived in Singapore most of his life.

We ordered our cocktails from a beautiful ""menuzine,"" a full-color book with a page dedicated to each drink. The cocktails were quite elaborate, with tons of ingredients and complicated processes. We are the correct audience for this sort of over-the-top mixology, but to our surprise, the results were not entirely successful. The one I take issue with is the Perfect Manhattan, made with Woodford Reserve rye, Carpano Antica, Mancino Secco, stracciatella, and chocolate bitters. The rye was fat-washed with stracciatella ice cream, and the whole thing was garnished with a chocolate cherry. This sounded interesting, but was weirdly less tasty and balanced than the Manhattans we make at home, also with rye and Carpano.

I did like our other three cocktails. The Ugly Tomatoes was nice, lightly sweet and savory, with Hendrick's Orbium gin, ugly tomatoes, kummel, and elderflower. The Yuzu Whisky Sour was solid, with Maker's Mark bourbon, yuzu marmalade, St. Germain, lemon, and egg white. The Peaches & Daisies was a lovely refreshing cocktail with Nikka Coffey grain whisky, lacto-fermented peach, cranberry, chamomile, and lemon.

We had a great time at Jigger & Pony, and I'd recommend it if you want a happening bar where you can sit and enjoy a fancy cocktail. Is it the fifth-best bar in the world? Probably not. But the drinks are unique and the vibes are good.",17/12/2024,Food & Beverage

The menu is a hardcover magazine like booklet that explains the bar and the drinks, there is also a page with all the drinks listed as a grid. The top row
Is least alcoholic and the bottom row is the most boozy.
The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. The bar tenders do make some amazing drinks and they make their takes on classics as well.
They also serve small bites like crab dip, impossible meat flatbreads and so on.
The music is really good here as well and I can't really explain the style. It sounded like a modern take on big band and swing music but it sounded great, it is loud in there.

The mixologist really spent his time crafting the cocktail, from the way he custom cut the block of ice to fit the glassware to resting a thin chocolate circle on top of the foam. I was given a wooden spoon and instructed to tap the chocolate circle to crack it into my drink. 

We also ordered some side dishes - charcuterie board, sausage and mash potatoes, olives and hummus. They also provided us complimentary tapioca chips and a roadie shot to go.

I am not big on getting mixed drinks, however when you come here how can you not?! I loved every drink I got, between my husband, friends and myself seemed like we had half the bar menu. The menu is really original as well, it's put together in a magazine/booklet form. I love it!

We had the following: 
Java Cooler: Tanqueray London Dry Gin, sesame, calamansi, Fever Tree Aromatic Tonic- light and tasty! 

June Bug: Hwayo 25 Soju, Koko Kanu Coconut Rum, homemade midori, awamori, lemon, egg white- This is a little sweet with the coconut rum, the egg whites gives the drink the froth on the top. 

Williams Cooler: Vedrenne Poire Williams, Capovilla Pere Williams, jasmine orris liqueur, lime, soda- This one was my favorite, there isn't too much to this one, light and fresh!

Everything here from the mixers to the spirits screams premium, so you had better be prepared to pay premium prices (around $22 Singapore for most cocktails); however, what you will get for you hard- earned dollar is an excellent cocktail and perhaps something you have never heard of before.

I saw a copy of bar PDT's cocktail guide, so it is obvious that this bar staff is taking a page from one of New York's legendary bars. Yup, win best bar in the world and you can pretty much call your bar legendary. It appears as if these guys have their eyes set on the prize, and the only area that I can see that they have to work on is customer interaction; they spent a great deal of effort making the drinks to perfection but it would have been nice to see some more flare, and a bit moe personality behind the bar. However, if you're just hanging with friends, this bar is an elegant experience.",18/7/2014,Food & Beverage
Jigger and Pony,5,"Didn't know a ton about Jigger and Pony but it got an endorsement from the Employees Only staff so certainly worth dropping in. The bar is relatively easy to find (as far as Singapore goes - no hidden doors or tricks involved) and is a very lovely set up. Its mid-century but dialed back a bit so it doesn't feel kitschy. 

The staff was awesome, all happy to chat, talk cocktails and shoot the breeze. The drinks were fun and well crafted but still approachable. One of the drinks was a riff on a Korean TGIFridays drink but with homemade Midori. I know this might not sound amazing, but it was a near perfect drink. It was well crafted, nuanced, and still managed to not take itself too seriously. I'm so glad I was able to make it into Jigger and Pony and wish I had shown up earlier in the night so I had time to try a couple more drinks. I would even consider staying in the Amara Singapore hotel above the bar just to maximize my drink time.",24/3/2020,Food & Beverage
Jigger and Pony,5,"This is the BEST cocktail bar I have ever been to. We went on a Thursday night and it was surprisingly quite empty -- not that we minded! We started out with the Corpse Reviver and the Moscow Mule. I had the former and it's probably my new favorite cocktail ever. The presentation is great - I love the beautiful jelly - and the cocktail itself is a masterpiece. The jelly tastes like absinthe, but better, and it melts in your mouth  when you sip this sour, refreshing drink. The Moscow Mule was also excellent - a perfectly done Moscow Mule, and very gingery.

For round two, we opted for Bad Blood and the Butterfly Effect. However, they were actually out of Bad Blood. I was pretty bummed, mostly because I had very much wanted a drink in one of those cute pineapple cups!! So, the bartender was awesome enough to make me a different drink, not on the menu, in that cup. He asked my drink preferences specifying that It had to contain absolut elyx. What I got was an incredible, tart and fresh elder flower cocktail with real flowers in it! I was so impressed by the bartender and waitress' efforts to go above and beyond to make sure I had a happy experience. It made the night even better to have such great service (in addition to amazing cocktails). The Butterfly Effect was also excellent - the flavors were very complex and the drink was very strong!

Again, this was probably the best cocktail experience I've ever had, due to the combo of amazing drinks and stellar service. I hope I can return to singapore soon so I can have such an experience again at jigger & pony.",9/5/2016,Food & Beverage

Jigger and Pony,3,"I've been here twice, and I think this place is A-OK if you are in the neighborhood for a drink and want a nice place to sit down, with a speakeasy sort of vibe.

They do bespokes well here, and I've been moderately satisfied with my drinks, given that bespoke drinks are sort of a wild card. The crowd here is mostly CBD types, with some couples here and there. I like to sit in their booths, where there is privacy and comfort.

They provide complimentary tapioca chips. I suggest you don't eat them, because once you start, you really can't stop. Price-wise I am not sure, but I assume that this is a 25 per cocktail sort of place. The AC can be a bit of downer at times.",12/2/2015,Food & Beverage
Jigger and Pony,5,"After checking out 28 Hong Kong and Bitters & Love, I came across Jigger and Pony and hit upon another excellent spot for classic cocktails.  And while there are certain similarities, there are also some definite differences as well.  At Jigger and Pony, the two things are a great selection of Japanese scotch and free bar snacks (the chips are addictive!) :).  They also do some interesting flights with both Europe and Asian scotch.  I tried an old fashioned and substituted the Makers Mark with Bulleit.  The drink was very well done, and I loved the trio of citrus - orange, lemon, and lime (see my pic).  The place can get pretty crowded and lively, but the service and quality remain high.  Definitely worth stopping by especially if you are near by Raffles Place.",28/7/2014,Food & Beverage
Jigger and Pony,5,"Jigger and Pony is a great cocktail bar without the stuffy attitude that tends to accompany such establishments. The menu is solid and the bartenders know they're shit. I had several different cocktails and sampled one of their punches, everything was on point - ok I was pretty trashed when I had the punch so it could have been terrible but I doubt it.

Jigger and Pony is definitely my go-to spot when I'm in Singapore. There might be better places out there, but I don't care to look for them. When I find a place I really like I stick with it.",18/11/2012,Food & Beverage

Jigger and Pony,4,"After some bar hopping, my friend and I landed at this bar and we ended up staying. Maybe it is because we were tired, drunk or both? Could be, but I felt that this was the best place we were at that night. I liked the atmosphere, we sat at the bar and it was nice to watch the bar tenders but more importantly, I think they did a pretty decent job with the cocktails. I am typically not very adventurous when it comes to cocktails, I like to stick to what I know so I went for an Old Fashioned and was not disappointed. 

I am doubting between 3 or 4 stars but the fact that they have a stocked a decent variety liquors and a seemingly well thought of menu (not only overly sweet concoctions - yay) makes me lean towards 4 stars. I also noticed that their menu has quite a selection of punch bowls, I haven't seen that in too many other bars in Singapore. Unfortunately, we didn't go for them as it was only the two of us and we already had our fair share of drinks before, but they looked quite attractive and this gives them that little edge which will make me come again.",13/1/2017,Food & Beverage

Moscow Mule was solid, service was quick, and the A/C was blasting.  I'd swing back in here, on a night on the town.  More of a 3 1/2 star quality.",4/7/2016,Food & Beverage

Jigger and Pony,5,"I have been a regular patron at this bar for over a year now. I come here more often than I would like to readily admit on social media (no I am not an alcoholic... I hope). Fundamentally I come for the holy trifecta of hospitality: the drinks, the atmosphere & the service. Jigger & Pony scores highly on all fronts.

As far as the drinks go, these are some of the best classic cocktails you're likely to find this side of Japan. If an Old Pal demands 240 stirs then 240 stirs it shall receive. What is the appropriate type of brown spirit to use in an Old Fashioned? Talk to the bar manager and he will sort you out based on your palate. Whiskey sour with egg white or without egg white? It's all good over here.

Mixing booze into glasses with garnishes and serving them at $20++ is a dicey thing to do. People have different tastes, you can't please everyone and for that kind of money they will have higher expectations. But having extreme attention to detail, akin to a cocktail Zen Master, and politely inquiring about your patrons' pre-existing tastes and cocktail prejudices certainly goes a long way.

Moreover the atmosphere at Jigger is excellent. It's rarely completely dead but never too crowded. The booths are very comfortable to sit for hours with a group of friends. The light is not too bright, not too dim and the music is at an appropriate volume for ambiance but doesn't kill conversations.

The service is friendly, polite and sometimes firm (but considering the horrors hospitality staff have to deal with this seems appropriate). The staff at Jigger will do their best to accommodate your requests as long as you're polite and understanding. Want to sit at the bar and talk the bartender's ear off? Sure, why not. 

When I started going to this place I knew none of the people that worked there (full disclaimer for bias-reporting purposes) but since being a regular there for over a year I consider them my friends. And that should be every man's relationship with the people that serve his liquor.",14/8/2013,Food & Beverage
Jigger and Pony,4,"Have you ever watched the Victoria's Secret fashion show and thought damn I want to look like Candice Swanepoel, so you order an $80 bikini... only to find its actually a thin piece of made-in-china junk and that all you saw on tv and the All Access site was the crafty work of Russell James and the brilliant Ed Razek?

That's how I feel about 70% of the restaurants and bars I visit these days in Singapore. A lot of hype and not much substance. So imagine my surprise this Thursday evening, when I found myself free from the clutches of a weekly Eastern time conference call and at the bar enjoying every minute.

Jigger & Pony won a toss up with Axis bar and for strange line of logic I won't explain here, J&P won. So I got on the phone to make a reservation. A cheerful and organized lady took my reservation, with surprise surprise, no need for gimmicky passwords, directions down Chinese streets or better yet, an answering machine with an elusive number. I ended up arriving half an hour late and my better half was at the table, grinning. That's a very good sign after a work day. He blurted out that the drinks were great, the menu actually listed good liquors by name,  the ice was hand cut AND they were serving delicious food samples. 

So there we were: 3 people, 9 drinks later and two 180g steaks (at $24 a steal, but its a rump/sirloin). We sampled almost half the aperitif selection and 2 classic cocktails and though some of us didn't take too well to 1-2 flavors, the flavor combinations were spot on. Forgive me for forgetting names but the grapefruit drink was genius (though not everyone's cup of tea) and I loved the Cuba Libre and American Lemonade (yes I like a tart profile in my drinks). This is one of those bars where the technique is miraculously consistent and you're allowed to enjoy your drink without pretense. That made my day.

Service was prompt, but the kitchen forgot our second steak order for a bit. Seats were comfortable and spaced well, the music and artwork was on trend but not jarring and the bathrooms were as clean as they will ever get for a bar. That the drinks were $14-22 was icing on the cake.

Is this one for the books? Duh.",7/6/2013,Food & Beverage
Jigger and Pony,3,"noisy, boisterous, hip cocktail bar in amoy street. depending on your age (mental or biological), you'll either love this place or hate it.

I used to love it - I came here when cocktail bars were still fresh and new, and it introduced me to the spumoni, a grapefruit-based cocktail that was imminently drinkable. it was loud-buzzy, which is to say that you could still lean over for conversation, and there was opportunity to speak to the person actually making your drinks.

flash three years or so ahead to my latest visit about a month ago - and boy, are things different. the noise level is exponentially magnified, the place is filled with younger ladies dressed rather minimally (by which I mean amount of cloth rather than aesthetic style), and it's almost impossible to get service.

in its defense, it's still buzzy (though in an almost clubby, out to have a GREAT time sort of way), and nice if you're out for a loud night out. but if you don't want to shout  (and still not be able to make yourself heard), I'd choose somewhere else.

p.s. I already know I'm grumpy.",22/11/2014,Food & Beverage
Jigger and Pony,3,"The good:  I feel like the staff cares, and the bartenders try hard, and that's a big plus for any F&B establishment.  My drinks have always been OK.  Nothing has caught me off guard in terms of atmosphere, patrons, drinks or even bar snacks - but expect wanker bankers.  Steady Freddy all the way.    

The bad:  But that's just it, there isn't a je ne sais quoi.  It's a combination of good elements that just don't quite bring me to bar euphoria.  It's like the England national football team, or the latest apple product, or all your favorite sodas spashed together in one cup.  It should be perfect, it should be bliss...but it isn't and no one knows why.  I'm not suggesting that it's too much of a good thing...it's just nothing great.  

The ugly:  I've been here numerous times and this is how I would describe it:  Sitting in a bathtub just when the water starts to get cold.  You don't want to get out, so you pour more hot water in (alcohol) but eventually you have to leave and no matter how good it felt when you first got in you're left with the memory of luke warm water.  Not quite the most poetic description, but what I'm trying to say is that it's better than a shower but in no way is it a hot tub.",17/2/2015,Food & Beverage

Jigger and Pony,4,"I've been here twice.

First time wasn't so impressive because we came in late and I was sitting at the edge of someone's table in a crowded cocktail bar. So i left and forgot about this place for a few months.

Fast forward nine months later, i was entertaining a visiting exec and was tasked with finding the venue. Jigger & Pony constantly came up as recommended place, so i figured - why not, i'll give them a proper chance. So off we went, a party of 8 seated at one of their booths. It was comfortable enough seating but the table did get a bit crowded once we started ordering food.

Food was great. we ordered meatballs, cold cut platter and and some sort of cheese melted on top of bread (but i forgot the name of this dish). All of them turned out excellent - far exceeded my expectation for bar food. Aside of this, they also constantly bring in free small sandwiches for you to nibble on. Other bars should take note of this - people love free food no matter how simple they are.

Cocktails were amazing - i get why they're named as one of the best cocktail bars in town. They have a selection of pre-dinner cocktails for $14 (usually $20) until 8pm, which i think is a total steal for the quality. I would recommend Moscow Mule (ginger beer!), Lavender Gimlet (gin and lavender) and Darjeeling Cooler.

The ambience and music makes it perfect for an after-work place, and you do see those type of people here especially with the place being so close to CBD. It reminds me of 28 hks minus the speakeasy factor. On top of that, service was top notch! We never felt neglected despite the place being pretty much full on Friday night.

Highly recommended, will come back again.",30/11/2013,Food & Beverage
Jigger and Pony,4,"This new, swanky establishment housed in a shophouse has a bartender that whips up a mean cocktail. Their focus is on craftsmanship and the personalized quality of each customer's drink. 

Much thought has been put into the deco of Jigger and Pony. The red and yellow seats were a result of an influence of Madrid and Barcelona, and the spare walls have been plastered with vintage French alcohol posters. The main line of inspiration comes from Japan, where Anthony's techniques and influences clearly come from Japan, where he once worked before. 

Its drinks menu comes in a grid-format, subdividing the squares into 24 $20 cocktails which will get you checking off those boxes. They are classified into 3 main simple categories, namely: Classic, Forgotten and Modern Twist. Try out ""Negroni"" which is crowd favourite. This blood-red drink has a slight bitterness, fortunately it's being softened and complemented with the orange zest.

Jigger and Pony,3,"I'm afraid to give reviews to these prohibition style bars like these since they are fueled by passion from the owners. Also, as far as drinks go, it really is ""to each their own"", everyone has different tastes in what they like.

For me, unfortunately, I felt this is one of those spots thats replaceable with any other one that is identical to it - those that have a bunch of different type of whiskeys, gin, rum etc, and also can create all of your typical old fashioneds, Manhattans, Gin and Tonic, Negroni, etc etc. I lived in New York for many years and there are dozens like this. Even here in Singapore you can hop to any of the other ""speakeasies"" around and get identical drinks and setting.

The ambiance and staff are beyond cool for sure. It's just that my girlfriend and I both had cocktails that weren't good at all. She had two different types and both tasted almost like medicine (one was the SG50 special cocktail called Little Red Dot or something). I had two different types, and both were pretty bad (one was called Donkey Kong and it tasted a bit off but I drank anyways), one I even sent back (the one that is milky and tastes like a sugary and heavier version of a White Russian), and I know I don't have that picky of a palette.

The chips are, however, contagious as many other Yelpers have mentioned. Very very good.

This would be a great place if you and your date or friend or group were coming to hang out after work in that area and sticking with your classic cocktails. Ambiance is excellent. It's just a concept that too similar to anything else out there with drinks that I feel can be found better elsewhere.",9/9/2015,Food & Beverage

Despite all these elements, I have to say that I wasn't especially impressed. The interiors are beautiful, that's for sure, but they are also cold and impersonal. The cocktails are nice enough, but I wasn't blown away.

They have a large list of interesting cocktails.  They arent cheap but theyre well made. happy hour prices are better if youre around at that time.  It seemed like a nice, quiet unassuming spot for a drink. I'm sure its more crowded on the weekend. They have some food but I didnt try it.

I was there for the first time last night, Thursday, and it was perfect - the music was good and turned up to just the right volume level that allowed you to get into the mood of the place and yet hear your conversations. There was a good size crowd of people, but not overwhelming. And what I appreciate most about this place is that it's not pretentious like what way too many other bars can be. It looks classy primarily because of the beautiful glowing lights from the bar, but yet it's also grungy at the same time. Very nice!

I first ordered the Paper Plane, as recommended by the guy who served us. He started off by asking my go-to alcohol of choice. For that night, it was bourbon. His description of the drink was succinct and descriptive enough for me to get a feel of what to expect. And true enough, the drink was tasty!

So as I was contemplating another drink and perusing through the menu again, the lady who made my Paper Plane came by to ask if she could help recommend something for me. Surprisingly she recommended the exact two choices I had just managed to narrow down myself - the Corpse Reviver and the King Cole - she read my mind! So I ordered the King Cole. It was simple and had just the right amount of kick to it, the perfect followup to my Paper Plane.

Jigger and Pony,1,"I have been to Jigger on a number of occasions now and usually we turn a blind eye to the over-priced cocktails (I mean, it is Singapore) because of the great vibes and ambiance. However, on my most recent visit, we were treated with one of the worst service experiences I have had in Singapore. I can usually turn a blind eye to over priced drinks and average quality, however, service is one factor that really makes or breaks it for me. 

Now, I'm not just talking about slow service or getting orders wrong or rude waiters, I am talking about it all... The lack of knowledge and unawareness of the waiters only become apparent when we asked for our bill at the end of the night. Firstly, we couldn't find a server to ask for the bill. When I went over to the cashier and asked them for our table's bill, they were unable to locate it, and apologized for being 'new' (I mean not everyone can be new now, can they?) They asked me to recount all the drinks we had and then attempted to re-do a bill. After this, it still took about 20 minutes for them to get us the bill and when they did, it was still wrong! They had charged us for a bottle that was not even ours. At this time, I was dealing with one of the servers who seemed to be pretty unaware and didn't really have a clue what was going on, moreover, he had no respect for his customers and spoke to me in the rudest manner possible and was actually yelling at me... I am not sure if he had been drinking on the job or he has no manners, both of which are terrible, but I have never been spoken to like this in my life and it was really the last straw for me. I am sorry, but Jigger has now been boycotted by me and my friends. I refuse to sponsor an institution which has zero regard for its customers and no sense of how to talk to a fellow human being. I am usually ok to deal with slow service, but we will not stand for ineptitude and downright rudeness.

Located on the second floor of the Raffles Hotel, just look for the line. I arrived around 5 pm on a week night and the line was out the door and starting down the stairs. Don't give up.  Hang out and read the information boards on the hotel and the cocktail. The line actually moved pretty quickly, I waited about 20 minutes.  No bad. 
There are a lot of table seats, but I recommend bar seating.  The old school dark woods, tile floor, wicker chairs, and spiral staircase makes this a beautiful spot. 

They offer a full bar but the Singapore Sling is the main attraction. 
First created in 1915, when gentlemen could nurse their gin or whiskey, but women were served teas and fruit juices. Bartender Ngiam Tong Boon created a socially acceptable concoction that looked like fruit juice, pineapple and lime juices infused with gin, curaçao, Benedictine and grenadine and cherry liqueur.

The Singapore Sling is SG$39 --wow, that's the most expensive drink I have ever paid for! Not gonna lie, the price tag kind of hurt. The drink itself wasn't too strong with fruity flavors.

We heard about this from our tour guide the day before so while we were nearby  on our last day in Singapore, we decided to throw caution to the wind and go get one. Well, I'm not sure it was worth it. First of all, the line of tourists outside the Long Bar was lengthy, but once inside, the air conditioning was on full blast and we were able to cool down. My husband and I ordered just one Singapore Sling to share at a whopping $46 SGD, which was about $34 USD. It was probably the most expensive cocktail I've ever had to date without knowing the price up front. I mean, it was listed on the menu as such but when I was in line, I didn't know it. If I had known, I would have hit up a different bar elsewhere to have gotten a better cocktail at a less expensive price. I don't even like gin but as they say, ""when in Rome..."" 

The Long Bar is located inside the Raffles Hotel, one of the oldest, high-end hotels in Singapore. Its decor is reminiscent of a plantation with columns and shutters of yesteryear.

Reviews from friends and other online sources have been mixed.  So just before 5pm my friend and I headed for the bar.  Fortunately the bar was located outside of the Raffles Hotel proper otherwise no one but guests of the hotel can visit this bar.  I have noticed this questioning of visitors to a number of the hotels that seems to show a level of unfriendliness of Singapore.  Anyways back to the bar, there was a short queue outside the bar which lasted only a minute as we were brought upstairs to a small booth for two.  The insides reflect the vintage decor which has been modernized for current use.  Once can watch the bartender make six Singapore Slings all at once which begs the question, would they taste consistent or stay true in taste?  My friend ordered the Original Singapore Sling while I ordered the Raffles 1915 Gin Sling.  Here it is, taste wise I love the 1915 Gin Sling.  The flavors and taste of this drink was just perfect.  The Singapore Sling was fruity with a bitterness at the end that I did not like.

In the end I recommend everyone visit the Long Bar at least once and try the Singapore Sling, and I also recommend trying other drinks to compare.",4/5/2025,Food & Beverage
Long Bar,3,"I wanted to like this place, I really did but it fell very short of expectations in my experience. When you arrive you wait in a queue to be seated (reservations are only available for parties of 10 or more). The line moves incredibly fast. Once seated though, we waited approximately 15-20 minutes prior to asking someone to place our order. 

Our server seemed to be annoyed at our asking regarding drinks and didn't provide much insight. We obviously ordered the Singapore sling, as they say it originated here. To their credit, this was the only bar in Singapore where I enjoyed this drink. As well, we tried a second drink with gin and curry and it was a total miss for me. We were planning to get a second drink and buy the cup to take home, however our drinks were empty for quite some time and we couldn't find our server. We were here slightly over one hour and only able to have one drink in that time period before asking the manager to close our check out. 

I like the ambience and idea of this place, however it ended up being a total miss for me despite the delicious Singapore sling. It wouldn't be enough to bring me back when there are so many good cocktail places in Singapore.",6/4/2025,Food & Beverage
Long Bar,5,"This is a ""must"" stop for anyone visiting Singapore. The Raffles building is a throwback to colonial times and the ambience is somewhat the same.

I loved the bag of peanuts on the table and the fact that you can throw the shells on the floor made me feel like a kid again making a mess for someone else to clean. This place was priceless and the attention to detail was incredible, let's talk about the tall glass of greatness, I see why it was recommended by so many.

Long Bar,5,"I had been meaning to hit up the originators of the Singapore Sling for years but either didn't have enough time or wasn't with the right people to appreciate some good old liquor history .

My husb and I came to Singapore as part of our honeymoon adventures. It was his first time in Singapore... And It. Was. On.

We walked up to the front of Raffles and one of the iconic front doormen kindly directed us towards Long Bar. It's a bit of a maze to get there but luckily there is plenty of signage and they're placed in perfectly strategic locations (like when there is a turn, long walkway where you're not sure if you missed it, and at the bottom of the stairs.

We loved the history displayed on the walls of the stairs leading up. We arrived around 2pm on a Thursday and were warmly greeted upon entering and shown to a small table for 2 in the middle of the room. We started our adventures with - of course - two Singapore Slings. Service was prompt, friendly, and the drinks were FABULOUS. Unsurprisingly, they're not cheap considering it's a historic bar, big tourist spot, and situated in the most famous (5-star) hotel in Singapore. The Slings were 37 SGD at the time of writing. You can pay 14 SGD to keep the glass.

We nommed heavily on the peanuts (which are free) and were happy to litter them on the floor - probably the only place in Singapore where littering doesn't come with a hefty fine!

For our second round we ordered the Golden Milk Punch and The Duke (named after John Wayne and comes with beef jerky as a garnish). Both were delicious!

Then we got the text that our hotel room was ready so we decided to end our cocktail adventures there and head back for a nap. We left around 330pm and passed a queue about 20 people deep waiting for a table. FYI, come early to avoid the wait.

TLDR; Come, drink cocktails, enjoy your fine decision making.",1/12/2022,Food & Beverage
Long Bar,4,"Long bar is at the Raffles Hotel. Note that the security around the hotel will not allow non-hotel guests into the hotel. To get to Long Bar, you have to venture around the hotel and up some stairs. There is signage along the way but it was kind of far from the hotel entrance.

This was a popular bar and note that we did wait (for a group of 7). You have to queue up and it seems to be first in, first out. Once you are inside, it'll be a air conditioned room with peanut shells all over the floor. There are a lot of small interior design flair, such as the moving sails at the roof. The seating is very comfortable and you will have your own huge bag of peanuts to share.

Now for the Singapore Sling... it was super expensive, but it was yummy... and you are essentially coming here for the hype. I thought it was a fun novelty experience.",22/6/2023,Food & Beverage

However, there were plenty of people waiting to get in as we were leaving, which is apparently the norm. Our party of 6 was seated right away at a round table in the corner. I loved the vibe of the bar, which felt like you were traveling back in time. I especially loved the fans on the ceiling and the old school cocktail shaker at the bar. All 6 of us ordered the Original Singapore Sling, since this was its birthplace. I have to say, it's not necessarily my drink of choice (a little too sweet), but it was a cool experience! Every table also had a sack of peanuts and patrons were permitted to throw the shells on the floor, which was fun. Definitely worth a visit!",21/1/2023,Food & Beverage

We found the drinks to be tasty and the free peanuts to be a nice treat. Although other reviews suggested that the drinks here are expensive, I'm not sure what those reviewers expected to find in a 5 star hotel -- we came from San Francisco where cocktails are generally in the same price range and are often lower quality.

One highlight was Ting, our waitress, and Suren, our bartender, both of whom were fantastic resources for us, sharing their favorite locations in Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand. Their recommendations enhanced our honeymoon trip and gave us an appreciation for what the locals find great about this incredible city.

Long Bar,5,"Recently renovated and reopened in late 2019.  It's on the second floor of the Raffles Hotel, and you may need to try a few different stairways and elevators before you find the right one to the bar, which makes it a bit of a hidden but historic gem and icon.

There was a small wait of a couple people when we arrived at 4pm on a Wednesday, but we were still seated within 5 minutes, up the winding staircase to a less crowded upper level.

Peanut shells were piled on the floor next to each table as most guests indulged slowly in their high potency and high priced cocktails.  We ordered a Singapore Sling $33sgd  and a mocktail version which was basically fruit punch, for $16sgd.

They did a great job making it feel like a throwback to another time and place, drawing on Malay plantation themes with mechanical fans wafting across the ceiling, but thankfully with modern air conditioning.  It's a place to indulge in the experience, not just the drinks, including getting lost in hotel courtyards and considering whether you might have a few more and book a $900/night room.  I can think of many worse ways to spend $50 for two on an afternoon.",16/10/2019,Food & Beverage

(1) The Singapore Sling here is actually not even very good! Tastes like watered down fruit punch (plus plenty of ice)... can't even taste the gin.
(2) It's SUPER expensive. $37 for one Sling drink... minimum of $28 for other cocktails. (To put pricez into perspective... even a pint of cheap lager like Tiger is $24 here!) 
(3) They have other signature cocktails on offer... but they don't even seem to know how to make them! We ordered a ""Sakura Sling"" which supposedly has sake, St. Germain, hibiscus, etc. We tasted none of the above. It just tasted like pur3 lime juice, and slightly fizzy. Sort of like a cosmopolitan (Yet the drink description contains NO citrus at all)
(4) The atmosphere is LAME... it's set in a colonial plantation style building, yet they are playing classic rock over the speakers?? Servers also seem rushed, miserable, unfriendly.

yes, its a complete tourist trap and if you really love the singapore sling, you should come here at least once... but the thing is that back in california, i never had a singapore sling, nor did i really yearn for one.
we didn't have too long in singapore, so we wanted to check out all the touristy things.

first of all, 1 original Singapore sling will cost you 25 USD. (this is before tax and service charges)... we got one, and we also got the raffles 1915 gin sling for 20 USD (before service charges and tax).
the prices don't really bother me, since it is at a very nice hotel.
what irked me was the fact they forgot my drink, had to wait like +15 mins since it was so busy....service sucked and there was long line to get in.

if you have a peanut allergy, do not come here.

I mean, my wife and I did it. And the drink was tasty, and I even got a tiny buzz from it. But almost every bar in this city also serves a Singapore Sling, for much cheaper. All the free peanuts in the building won't recoup that cost. Service was basic - one person sat us down, another took our order then took our menus away.

The bar is located in the Raffles Hotel in a colonial style building. Follow the signs to go around the left of the main entrance of the hotel and then go up the stairs to find the Long Bar. 

Service is fine - not especially attentive. No one came to check on us after we'd finished our first round of drinks. 

Oh, and did I mention that it's ridiculously overpriced. You'll be paying SGD 30+ for a cocktail. 

Sure, it's the original and it's fairly strong even if served in a small glass, and I guess you have the cool vibe of being able to eat the complimentary peanuts and throwing the shells on the floor like they did in the old days, but still, that's a steep price to pay.

When you walk in, you first get a reminder that Durians are not welcome in the bar.
You can order your Singapore Sling as well as a few other drinks at the bar and if you're lucky enough to come at the right time, you can sit at the bar along the front window or at one of three small high tops.

Long Bar,3,"As the birthplace of The Singapore Sling, this place is super-touristy and expensive, but worth a visit anyway, just to see it. (Even if you're sitting there feeling kinda tongue-in-cheek like I was because it's just SO touristy.)

Most people come here to try the actual Singapore Sling, but it was way too expensive for my liking, so I just hung out for a bit to check out the atmosphere and because I like historic places.

The whole place is really dark, with dark wood everywhere and dim lighting and a cool curving staircase. At night, you almost feel like you're underground in some creaky old wooden basement bar with those rectangular green lamps like you often see hanging over pool tables. (Oh and yes, the bar itself does live up to its name -- it's long.)

In general, this place exudes a heavy, dark, historic vibe. Unfortunately, it also exudes a vibe of overweight sweaty cashed-up Western tourists avoiding the heat and humidity in the darkest air-conditioned place they can find, which luckily for them is probably listed as one of the highlights of Singapore in whatever crappy guidebook they're using. 

To be fair, the Raffles Hotel complex is pretty cool and worth a quick wander to soak up its historic elegance and charm -- I'd just be hard-pressed to name it as a highlight of Singapore when there are so, so many more awesome places to go to and sights to see in this city. 

It was also very noisy and crowded on a weekday evening (around 8pm). Very hard to hear yourself think because of all the buzz and chatter around you. Of course, some might love that tourist energy and claim it's all part of the fun.

Also on offer are peanuts in their shells, which people take great relish in crushing and dropping on the floor, a la Texas Roadhouse.

So yeah, definitely stop in, have a look, splash out the money for a Sling if you really want to, but just go knowing what to expect. Then have a look at the charming Raffles building itself -- the courtyards are really lovely with lush tropical foliage set against the graceful white building, and at night you can have many of the corridors to yourself for photo ops.

So needless to say, it is the tourist thing to do and while it isn't the most amazing bar experience you will have, it is certainly not ""just a touristy thing to do.""

Set in the historic Raffles Hotel, the bar takes you to a bygone era. One where plantations doted the countryside and where world empires colonized the remote spots on the earth. It also doesn't hurt that they encourage you to throw the peanut shells on the floor...but remember, only the peanut shells.

Now, there is a menu of cocktails...but you really should come here for one thing: The original Singapore Sling. There are other versions on the menu of course, but you really should have the original. At about $30SGD, it is a bit pricey, and you are probably not going to want to order a second...or maybe you do?

The bar menu selection is what you probably would come to expect and it is a nice nosh to go with your cocktail. Especially if you want to walk out versus stumbling out.

Service was pretty good and the staff attentive. While they weren't hovering over you and quick, they certainly made you feel comfortable.

Long Bar,4,"One of the most touristy things to do in Singapore is go to the Long Bar in the historic Raffles Hotel and have a Singapore Sling.  I had slight reservations about forking over $30 for a cocktail, but it sounded like something we needed to do on our first and most likely last trip to Singapore.

As we sat at the bar, we learned that this year the Singapore Sling turns 100!  The famous cocktail was created in 1915 by bartender Ngiam Tong Boon.  The story goes that at the time women were prohibited to drink alcohol.  Boon got around this by creating a cocktail that resembled fruit juice which made it acceptable to drink.  

There are many varieties of the Singapore Sling.  Being light weights we chose one that was champagne based.  We enjoyed eating the free peanuts and tossing some of the shells on the floor.  FYI, this is the only place in Singapore where ""littering"" is permitted.  :D

That being said, I decided to end my first night in Singapore here. It was a lovely just for the experience, which is the reason most people go. Yes, there's a ton of tourists, it's a bar in a famous hotel. Not shocking. But it wasn't at all over crowded and it was cool to meet people(mostly couples) from other places.

Long Bar,2,"This review is specifically for the ""Singapore Sling Masterclass"" that is advertised by Long Bar for $116.52 as a 90 minute experience learning about the history and process of the creation of the iconic Singapore Sling Cocktail.
Here is what this 90 minute experience was actually comprised of:

1) 2-3 minutes of a very general and casually told description of the history of the      Singapore Sling (the same story that is written on wall signage throughout      Raffles, except poorly and hastily told).
2) 5-10 minutes maximum of making a Singapore Sling cocktail that:
is lacking any detail or description of the process, gives no consideration or depth of information of ​flavour ​profiles.
3) 1 hour to drink the cocktail you made, probably not well for a first try,
4) A complimentary Singapore Sling Glass,
a complimentary plate of 3 satay sticks

I am no expert in cocktails / mixology - I was fascinated to delve into this precision artform/science, and where better would this be experienced by here at Raffles. I honestly thought that this would be on display. Sadly, no. It was a generic, hasty affair that was only stretched out to 90 minutes because of how long we had to wait for the complimentary satay sticks that is included in the package.
Some truly disappointing examples of the experience were:
1) When I asked if a specific kind of gin was needed, I was told ""yes, it needs gin"". Sooo, I presume any gin will do? I had to look at some recipes      later to find that I needed London Dry Gin.
2) We were given a complimentary ""Recipe Card"" for the secrets of making the perfect Singapore Sling. This card has ingredients, but no measurements included. It's lucky I wrote them down after we finished making our drinks.

(The measurements, btw, are 30ml London Dry Gin, 10ml Dom Benedictine, 10ml of  Cherry Liqueur, 10ml of Dry (Orange?) Curacao, 20ml of pineapple juice, 60ml of lime juice (or are those juices switched around? Dammit, I don't      
 remember), 10ml of Grenadine Syrup and a dash of bitters, garnished with a cherry and a pineapple wedge. Shake violently over ice, double filter and pour over ice again.

3) There was an utter lack of finesse trying to explain how to measure 10ml or 20ml of liquid into a 15ml or 30ml slope-sided jigger.

Overall, you are paying for the ""experience"" as much as the drink you (probably poorly for the first time) made. This experience aspect all felt rushed, bordering on unprofessional and almost impatient to get it done.

Sadly, I do not recommend this experience to anyone, whether novice or expert in cocktails alike. You will leave bemused and disappointed in what your hard earned money gets you in such a well-renowned establishment.",2/2/2022,Food & Beverage

Long Bar,3,"A bit of an odd place.

Got an invitation after buying some spirits for a drink at the Long Bar, thought there was time so why not?

The concept is fantastic - an established brand like Raffles, a functional bar, limited seating. Tucked away upstairs of the main alcohol duty free shop in terminal 3. 

There's some spirits available for tasting, and the invitation will get you one (small) cocktail with various spirits that are on sale.

While sipping on your drink, walk around to look at the displays of Hendrick's gin, Johnnie Walker, Glenfiddich, Absolut vodka (stay away from the new Oaked barrel stuff, it's just plain weird). Go through to the wine and rare whisky room, and feel good about the amount of money you have spent in comparison for what you could've (me: couldn't) spend on these fancy rare bottles.

This place could be more than what it is, they could actually turn it into a functioning bar if they wanted to, and leverage the Raffles brand more.

Having said all that, who would turn down a free cocktail?!

Long Bar,3,"Ah, The Long Bar, a tourist trap if ever there was one. Now, don't get me wrong, this truly is a beautiful bar and will conjure a feelings Hemingway and other notables as soon as you enter the bar. It exudes Old World Colonial Charm all the way, but that charm comes at a high price. 

First, so many tourist frequent The Long Bar that locals rally aren't hanging out here, which, if you're concerned about authentic flavor, you want to be were the locals are. Singapore locals are cool always willing to clue you into the best bar, the best hawker stand, or the best anything. 

Secondly, you are probably here for the Singapore Sling, because someone said you should. Well at $33, you may want to rethink that experience. One reviewer said that, ""The Long Bar was the saddest places in Earth, filled with tourist sipping on the overpriced Sling."" I don't know if I would necessarily go that far, but I think you should realize that for the most part this is a tourist thing...but sometimes, it's fun to play tourist, as long as you know what you're getting into.",24/7/2014,Food & Beverage

Unlike many other bars in Singapore, the sling here is made with real juice and bits and bobs... Rather than pre mixed mixers.

Long Bar,2,"Ahh the birth place of the famous Singapore Sling! 

The Long Bar is an overcrowded, overpriced tourist trap. It tended to be under staffed with staff not having time to look after the patrons. When I visited, we were quickly rushed in and 2 minutes later asked what we would like to order. We noticed that our waiter was told off by the boss for not moving and serving quicker! The drinks arrived 10 minutes later and were sweet and fun. I asked twice for a glass of water, as I'm  extreme lightweight and was told it was coming- it never came . From the time we arrived and got through the shambolic queue we were about 35 minutes and then prompty and quickly ushered out once the drinks were empty. So off we went on our woozy way underwhelmed.

There was nothing really special about this place. However I'm glad I went and tried it out but after being once, I'm in no rush to return. I think for the price paid there are much better bars to visit.",20/2/2013,Food & Beverage
Long Bar,3,"Long Bar is a place that you visit just because.

Well, because there is so much history attached to it. It's where the Singapore Sling was originally created. Yes, that's right. The Singapore Sling cocktail IS actually created in Singapore. Unlike the ubiquitous so-called ""Singapore Fried Noodles/Rice"" found in Americanized Chinese restaurants in the US that have no roots whatsoever in Singapore.

Long Bar is located on the 2nd flr of the Raffles Hotel. This historic colonial hotel is beautiful especially in the evening, with its facade lit up.

The most visible character of Long Bar is the concept of in-shell peanuts served to guests. You crack open the shell, pop the peanut into your mouth, and throw the shells on the ground. There is also a live Filipino band that performs though the night we were there, it was more of a golden oldie type of band rather than a band who plays their rendition of current hits. I'm not sure if this the usual since I've only been once. Most guests are non-locals and I can understand why. Long Bar feels a little lackluster for those looking for a trendy place. For those with a colonial nostalgia, Long Bar is where you can spend a couple hours at in the evening. The Singapore Sling cocktail is S$27. That's a bit steep but hey, it's the Long Bar. Not gonna lie, I prefer an Old Fashioned cocktail anytime.",12/6/2014,Food & Beverage

Long Bar,3,"So its a bit of a tourist trap but how many people will come to Singapore without doing drinks at Raffles?
Singapore isn't cheap for booze to start with and of course you are paying $sing 27 for a sling so that bar bill can rack up quickly.
It is however the experience you go for, its Raffles and wandering through the hotel grounds enroute to the Long Bar is nice. 
Service is patchy in the bar - been 3 times now so sometimes good, other times waiting ages to get served. You also get the sack of peanuts and of course you should be dumping the shells on the floor. 
Cute colonial decor, great ceiling fans and some nights there is live music and the bands playing are great.  
Food was ok - had a decent burger post flight last time and it was great but then had one before and it was a bit dry.

That might be partly because the place wasn't jam packed as it was early afternoon on a weekday, but it was also a cool bar with a classically quaint atmosphere. Service was fine too.

The Singapore Sling itself was quite good for a sweet girly drink. I think the bill was 156 SGD for a total of 6 of them, which comes to around 20 USD per Sling these days. On a relative scale, I don't recall paying less than 10  - 15 SGD for a pint anywhere in Singapore. Plus, they give you free peanuts (woo hoo!) at Long Bar.",13/4/2013,Food & Beverage

I've heard about this bar - since it's very popular for their Singapore Slings, and only had the opportunity to visit it a few months ago. I was somewhat surprised. The music and ambiance was very nice - the music was jazz-pop, and I was fully entertained. I thought it was pretty shocking that you were allowed to throw your peanut shells on the floor - the only place in Singapore where littering is encouraged. Haha. That sorta did make my day. Though I didn't participate, it was pretty interesting.

What I Love: The throwing your peanut shells on the floor bit - that was pretty fun. The music, the ambiance, which is very chill - was nice.

What I Don't Love: Unfortunately, the Singapore Sling - which we went there for - was quite a dud. It was pretty boring. I've had better Singapore Slings elsewhere. The ones I get on Singapore Airlines is wayyyy better than this Bar. And each drink is $25-ish. So, 3 drinks including tax and peanuts would set you back a whopping $100.

AMBIANCE: It is on the second floor of the famous Raffles Hotel, which is absolutely beautiful. It has a colonial/tropical, relaxed feel to it as you walk up the stairs, there are a lot of high end stores along the way. The hotel has really cute architecture, and water fountains that you can take pictures at. 

The bar itself is pretty old school, something right out of a movie. Everything is wood, with white and black tile floors, a bit of a high ceiling with unique shaped fans. They also provide peanuts in a burlap bag with their name printed on it. The peanuts are really small, but tasty and you can throw the shells on the floor. 

DRINKS: Singapore Sling! That's why people come here, it's super expensive but it's tasty. I had some of my friends drink, but I just ordered a Tsingtao beer. 

SERVICE: Quick, we had a waitress come to get our orders right after we sat down. She checked on us before

Long Bar,2,"Ready to tick 'Have a Singapore Sling at Raffles' off that bucket list? Ok then, best you get yourself to Long Bar. Bring money. 

I am going to give a completely honest review of this place. I have been to Singapore before and avoided this spot, but on a day when we had nothing to do and walked right past it we thought what the heck. We are tourists after all, let's see what the fuss is about. 

The inside itself is quaint. Filled with old banker lights and fans that swing side to side. It's bustling at all times of day and night, filled with people from all over the world that have decided they 'must' get their Singapore Sling from Raffles. 

That is where the charm begins and ends. To start, the drinks are priced to take advantage of tourists. A Singapore Sling will cost you $28++ and it's quite frankly, revolting. Let's be honest here, it's a terrible cocktail and they are pumping them out on mass so there is little care going into your drink. 

To add insult, a pint of Tiger will cost you almost the same price. So for one cocktail and one beer, we were stung more than $50 plus tax. 

There is the 'quirk' of it being the only place in town that allows littering, with the floor covered in empty peanut shells. I don't know how or why this is appealing. It's disgusting and your bar stool is likely covered in other people's filth. 

Finally there is the clientele. The ""bucket list"" crowd. Which by the look of the average age, could be just about any day now. Think cruise wear, grey hair. George Costanza's father would not look out of place here. 

So there you have it. If drinking a poorly tasting, overpriced beverage in a pool of peanut shells and seniors sounds like something that floats your boat, then yes, you *must* have a Singapore Sling at Raffles.",11/12/2014,Food & Beverage
Long Bar,3,"Long Bar,

You have one job. ONE JOB! Sling red pineapple juice to hot and sweaty tourists. You should practically have a production line for these diabetes-inducing drinks. Carton to table in 30 seconds. What I don't expect is to have to flag down a waiter 15 minutes after I order two signature drinks inquiring about their whereabouts. Speaking of waiters, let's talk about the service charge. If I am paying an obligatory 10% extra for service, I expect some service. For example, someone should come to my table at least once and ask something along the lines of, ""How is your overpriced pineapple juice? Would you like to order some food? How about a $40 burger?""

Actually, regardless of the improvements you could make, people will still come. Even if they don't like pineapple juice, they'll come for the sake of being proper tourists. Hell. If I could get away with charging $31 for fruit juice grenadine and people still came to my bar in droves, I wouldn't change a damn thing either.

The bar is gorgeous, just like the historic Raffles Hotel where it's located, the peanut shells strewn all over the floor make for a casual and fun atmosphere, and on the night we visited, the cover band was more than entertaining.

It is kind of neat to sit back and soak up the historical, colonial/plantation style decor  of The Raffles Hotel, hailing back to Singapore's exotic, colonial days. I recommend this as a mid-afternoon stop, right when you're drenched with sweat and ready to pass out from heat exhaustion.

Long Bar,4,"There was no Yelp in Singapore when I was there back in April (to my knowledge) but I figured it's never too late to Yelp the places I visited when I was there..especially since I was pretty detailed in my blogging about my trip haha.

Anyways, my friend and I were only in Singapore for a few days and this was a place I really wanted to hit up. We checked out Long Bar at Raffles Hotel after a trip around the Night Safari. We caught a cab straight to Raffles Hotel and had quite a bit of an adventure looking for this bar. Let me first say that we were there on a Tuesday night so we weren't exactly sure it would still be open. We were dropped off in front of the main doors of the hotel and didn't see a soul. So we walked around the premise of the hotel. We found a restaurant that with a sign on it saying that Long Bar was closed. We tried asking a worker for directions because the restaurant didn't look anything like what I imagined the bar to look like. The directions weren't very clear so we wandered around a bit. We went up and down the stairs and didn't find the place until we were about to give up. We probably spent 20-30 minutes wandering looking for it. 

By the time we found the place, we were told that they were about to close but they allowed us in when we told them we just wanted a quick drink. They offered a number of different versions of the Singapore Sling. I've never had one before but I figured if I knew where it was invented, I should definitely try it. 

It was very fruity and sweet and I quite enjoyed it. The first thing you will notice when entering the bar however, is that the floor is covered with peanut shells. They had a heaping bowl of peanuts on each table and customers are encouraged to just drop their shells on the floor. That was definitely unlike anywhere I've been in the past.

I wish I could have found the place earlier and on the weekend because I wouldn't mind chilling their a bit longer. 

So to summarize (if you don't want to read my all that): I liked the place. The peanut-floored atmosphere was super cool. The drinks were good.

BUTTTT: it was hard to find (for us at least -__-) and it was very pricey. Our total (of just two drinks) came out to $30 including tip. Definitely was one of my most expensive drinks.

It was very, very crowded but we were able to snag a couch area in the middle of the bar where we happily sank into comfy couches to relax our feet and indulge in a classic drink.  The bar looks like it could be from an older movie set and with the peanut shells everywhere it does have a certain appeal and air of an older time.

Yes it's expensive but the reality is that all of the cocktail bars we went to in Singapore were expensive, so, it's probably on average about $5-$10 more than the other cocktails I had on my trip.  I got the classic SIngapore Sling which was fruity, topped off with a generous pineapple chunk and frothy from shaking.  It wasn't very strong, sadly, but maybe it's one of those drinks that sneaks up on you over time.

The drinks themselves were very good. Be careful though, expect sticker shock. I paid $75 Singapore dollars for two drinks which translates to between 55 and 60 US dollars.

We wanted to accomplish two things with our visit to Long Bar. 

1. We wanted to see Raffles Hotel. 
2. We HAD to try the original Singapore Sling.

The hotel was named after British statesman Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, the founder of Singapore. The hotel has just had major renovations and the grounds are absolutely stunning. The Long Bar also doesn't disappoint. 
There was a small queue to be seated at noon on a Monday. We were seated with a bag of peanuts and two menus. The waiter came took our order for Singapore Slings promptly. The original Singapore sling will cost you 25 USD. (this is before tax and service charges). However, this is the original and well worth it. The recipe seems to be a mystery. I think each place in Singapore where I ordered a Singapore Sling tasted differently. It is now great to have the original and have a baseline. I thought it was great. Not too sweet and a perfect mid afternoon cocktail.
If you want to eat anything with this, you won't be able to as they only have a cocktail menu.

I am still a lightweight) and being happy drunk in the middle of the day with a face that said ""Asian glow"" to the taxi line at Raffles City Shopping Center and practically passing out in the cab! hahaha... good times. 

I took a friend to here last week to enjoy a Singapore Sling - I ordered a virgin sling (because I'm lame and didn't feel like drinking that night due to the fact I had to work the next day) and she ordered the regular. They messed up the order and brought two regular slings. Yea, I could taste that one was stronger than the other... I sipped a bit of the drink and then had to call the waiter over. They charged us for two regular slings. The took away the sling and replaced it with a virgin version and didn't charge us for the sling or the virgin version. That was really nice of them to do that. 

The ambiance in The Long Bar takes you back to a different colonial past but the AC really is freakin' cold! The live band was lively and people were dancing in front of them which was really cute. Not a mosh pit or a club type atmosphere so the total classy factor of this place is perfect. It was a weekday so the place had tables of tourists and older expats.

In short, the Long Bar is definitely not destination quality, but a good pit stop if you're feeling homesick.",28/12/2012,Food & Beverage
Changi Airport Singapore,5,"If you have to get stuck at an airport- then this is the airport that you want to get stuck in.  This airport offers everything you need, including entertainment.  At this airport you can shop till you drop with all the high-end offerings.  Plus you can be entertained by movies, water fountains, butterfly gardens and more.  They even had a hello kitty exhibit during my visit.  Plus, once you are tired from shopping, you can catch at a nap at a hotel within the airport so you don't even have to even leave security.  If you have a long layover, you can catch a night of sleep at the crown hotel next door, better than the hotel within the aiport, and go on a free tour offered by Singapore.  What a win win experience!",15/1/2025,Hotels
Changi Airport Singapore,5,"Last I heard, Doha's Hamad International Airport has surpassed Singapore's Changi Airport as the world's best. Although I haven't yet visited Qatar, I recall that Changi had undergone several changes the last time I was there. One standout feature is the massive vortex waterfall, surrounded by lush greenery--it's truly a breathtaking sight inside the airport. Beyond that, the airport feels more like a huge shopping mall, with restaurants at every turn. There's so much to do that you could easily spend a night or two there! In fact, they offer a hotel called Yotel, where guests can enjoy flexible check-in and check-out times. The airport also has a variety of activities, some of which require an entrance fee. It's definitely a place where you won't just be sitting around waiting for your flight!",1/12/2024,Hotels
Changi Airport Singapore,5,"I'm always late getting to the airport because I feel like a sucker when I'm there too early, an hour of boredom my reward for responsible adult behavior. This would not be true if every airport were like Changi. This place is practically an amusement park. I could spend days here without running out of things to do.

My husband and I were only in Singapore for about 36 hours, but we decided to spend a few of them hanging out at the airport before our flight home. We arrived almost four hours ahead of our departure and that was just enough time to accomplish everything on our list.

We checked in for our flight and dropped off our luggage, then headed over to Jewel, the enormous mall attached to the airport by a tram and a long walkway. Jewel's centerpiece is the Rain Vortex, the world's largest indoor waterfall. It's a spectacular sight at the heart of the mall, with all the shopping, dining, and other entertainment built around this giant pillar of falling water. We only looked at it for a few minutes, but we might have walked the trails surrounding it if we'd had another hour to kill.

We grabbed an early dinner at Jumbo Seafood, where I ate an entire chili crab. I gather there are about a thousand dining options at Changi, but I felt I chose correctly. It was the best airport meal I've ever had.

Afterward, we made our way back to the airport side. We were flying Singapore Airlines out of Terminal 3, and the place was beautiful, huge and pristine, with high, elaborately constructed ceilings. There was some kind of Sanrio celebration going on, with decorations everywhere we looked. These included the largest Hello Kitty I've ever seen, welcoming travelers into the terminal.

We had some last-minute shopping to do, and had no problem finding souvenirs for our kids and niece. There was a vending machine that sold toy Singapore subway trains and I picked up a few merlion stuffies from the Kaboom toy store. I also browsed one of the many duty free shops just to try on a Chanel lipstick.

At some point, we utilized the SilverKris Lounge. This was a fantastic lounge, but it was also almost wasted on this airport, where lounging was low on our agenda. I was too full of crab to take advantage of the impressive buffet, but it was nice to sit down for a bit.

We left enough time to visit the butterfly garden on our way to the gate. Unfortunately, the butterflies were sleeping at eight at night (I guess even Singapore can't keep butterflies awake for tourists), but the garden was pleasant, and we got to see dozens of chrysalises on display, some of them twitching with emerging butterflies.

We only went through security after all of these adventures, at a small, efficient station set up at our gate. Changi is the only airport I've heard of that has security checkpoints at every gate. This was an unexpected convenience, one last luxury before we got on our plane.

I'd heard that Changi was the best airport in the world, but honestly, that doesn't quite capture the extravagant splendor of this place. I hope to visit again and maybe see a movie at the free 24-hour theater, or stay at one of the on-site hotels. Even with a short layover, I'd be sure to hit Jewel for Jumbo Seafood and the Rain Vortex.",31/12/2024,Hotels

Not only is this the most beautiful Airport in the World (Voted upon by the travel industry) but the modern Lounges and the Airport hotels make this the most convenient place to stay if you have a long layover ( 16 hours for me) I don't mind at all.   I just walked through this massive layout, with 4 huge terminals to explore.    

Lots of hidden gardens, magical and whimsical in so many areas of all four terminals, lots of kids' play areas, and massive amounts of great food vendors throughout.  
In addition, if you're so inclined to do some High-end shopping all your Bougie designer's can be found here.   Lots of duty free stores for last minute purchases as well.

Chye Seng Huat Hardware,4,"I'm always a bit hesitant when I read Marcus L.'s reviews. I find him to be a very optimistic man. But, I can certainly say now that he KNOWS his coffee. And, folks, Chye Seng Huat Hardware KNOWS their coffee. They KNOW KNOW KNOW--if you know, know what I mean. 

My gf and I stopped by after brunch and tried their signature blend, Treva Link (I believe?). It was fantastic to the very last drop! I generally don't finish my coffee at artisan places, but my pretty coffee cup was licked dry! The tables and bars are kind of small so I don't recommend ordering a proper meal. There was barely enough space to hold our two small espressos cups so I can't imagine two full plates on top of that. This place is definitely more of a coffee haven to chit chat so no book worms, please!  

The crowd does seem to be the hipster type. A trend I seeing bursting along Jalan Basar and Tiong Bahru. But hey! Who doesn't love the Brooklyn, Filmore, or Art District kind of vibe? If you miss the art-sy, popular coffee shops found in New York, San Francisco, or L.A., definitely stop by this place.",3/3/2013,Food & Beverage
Chye Seng Huat Hardware,4,"Tucked away in the most unlikely place in Singapore, Chye Seng Huat Hardware does not sound or look like it would be a ""hip"" hangout place from the outside. Once you step inside though, you're greeted with a nice little cafe with cozy decor and chill music. Yep - a speakeasy-ish coffeehouse. who would've thought?

We arrived 45 minutes after noon and the place was packed. We couldn't get a seat inside (which is very limited) and had to settle for an outside seat. It wasn't ideal after walking in the sweltering sun, but after sipping on the cold brew it was quite comfortable. If you come here around 2pm be prepared to wait for a seat. Some people were definitely eyeing our table as we were finishing our brunch.

Cold Brew Coffee $7 - I would really like to try their hot coffee, but for reasons stated above I would be absolutely crazy not to go for the cold brew. I'm not a coffee connoisseur by any means, but this was really good quality coffee. I loved that it came in a cute medicine bottle and ""deconstructed"" form so you can mix it up to your desired sweetness!

Scrambled Eggs $11 - It's a small portion for me, but I'm a big eater. Price is very reasonable in relative to other brunchy places / cafe in Singapore.

Raspberry Financier - My friend got this to share. I have no idea how to pronounce the name of this cake, but it was good and not overly sweet

Red Velvet Muffin $3.80 - This is such a disappointment! The cream was half frozen and the cake was really dry. I would never waste money on this again.",15/7/2013,Food & Beverage
Chye Seng Huat Hardware,3,"Overall, I enjoyed my experience at CSHH. It's a quaint coffee shop and great for a quick bite. I ordered the ""salmon toastie"" which was great. They food was presented well and tasted good. My only issue was the cold brew nitro coffee on tap. I've had nitro beers and coffees before, however, this one was a bit flat. Other than that, no complaints. I would definitely return again for the food and maybe opt for a different drink instead",25/5/2018,Food & Beverage
Chye Seng Huat Hardware,4,"*Drum rolls* CSHH is the flagship store of Papa Palheta. If you like PPP, you will definitely love this place featuring a Coffee Bar, Coffee Retail, The Roastery, The Workshop and The Annex. The roastery and coffee bar is exactly what it means, the annex is where the tasting happens (call and reserve in advance! 23 bucks!) and the coffee retail is where they display the coffee gadgets and add ons some of which are really interesting. 

Jalan Besar is definitely not the easiest place to get to but I went there twice without driving. so its not impossible lol. Don't be fooled by the front of the store, it may look closed due to the shutter grills but the ""main entrance"" is actually on the side, just like how PPP's entrance was behind. Pretty cool concept and it definitely fits well into the entire row of shophouses in the area. 

Check out the menu too. its really simple.. espresso + milk, espresso + water and brewed coffee. no coffee jargon involved. with a really interesting drink that I didn't get a chance to try.. the beer (& coffee) moment where the description was something like Jungle Beer x Papa Palheta if I am not wrong. maybe someone who has tried that can let me know if its awesome :p

Chye Seng Huat Hardware,4,"You'd probably dismiss Chye Seng Huat Hardware because of its rather nondescript traditional looking exterior. Go through the gate and you'll find a very cool and newly opened little coffee joint hidden inside. 

We popped by CSHH (I have so much problem trying to remember the name!) for lunch and the food there is so-so, nothing particularly outstanding and must-have - it's a coffee joint after all so food isn't quite the key thing here and it shows. The omelette was a tad small, the beef patty's a little lacking in taste for me (though presented beautifully with 3 different condiments), but the salami sandwich was ok.

The really unusual thing they have here is Coffee Ale - a special collaboration of Papa Pahelta beans with local brewery Jungle Beer. Owner Leon who was in store that day took time out to explain the brewing process quite thoroughly - this is a guy who knows his beans and beer! It was a really unusual brew with a pleasant (not overwhelming) coffee smell and aftertaste, yet still refreshing as a cold beer is.

The staff here are friendly and amiable, the environment is cozy and organic, definitely an upcoming hipster hang-out and a nice place to chill out (hopefully it doesn't get too crowded!). Besides the main area, there are also smaller areas behind - an Annex, Workshop and Roastery, as well as an empty courtyard which I assume is where the crowd might spill over to in future.",16/8/2012,Food & Beverage
Chye Seng Huat Hardware,5,"Adding on to the indie cafe scene, Chye Seng Huat by Papa Palheta does a coffee education, true to its roots as a coffee roastery and father of third movement in Singapore. They kept the exterior of the hardware store and also elements of steel bars and grills are incorporated into the interior.

The food is surprisingly fantastic despite the rather limited menu. Each item is carefully crafted. The platter saw a fresh mix of pork rillette, duck terrain, salami and Parma ham. The smoked salmon sandwich was also delightful.

Save some space for their desserts. The hazelnut ginger tea cake was a great end to a fantastic meal.",2/9/2012,Food & Beverage

While it's exterior retains the traditional look of a usual shophouse, complete with chinese characters on its walls and metal bars at its windows, the interior is an interesting spin on the modern day cafe and bar. 

I had their pistachio cranberry cake as well as their raspberry fingers. For $4 for 2 slices of their cakes, it is one of the most value-for-money ones around. It was pretty nice too, albeit being a tad bit too sweet. I had a regular flat white, as well as a cold brew. While the flat white did not impress, the cold brew had an interesting acidic and slightly fruity undertone. It was a nice refreshing drink that is great to have on a hot day.

Chye Seng Huat Hardware,5,"It's interesting to witness what's going on at Jalan Besar and its vicinity. The neighbourhood is slowly changing hardware stores and workshops for cool hostels, galleries and coffee shops. Chye Seng Huat Hardware Coffee is the perfect example of this process. The building used to house hardware companies. Now it is a coffee bar, gallery and roastery. It is so hip it makes me feel like I'm back on Mexico City's ultra-hipster neighbourhoods. It has a very cool atmosphere, complete with a turntable for vinyls (actually they just plug a tablet into it, but I'd like to think it works), industrial-style benches, free lo-fi newspapers, and a colourful, friendly staff.

At the coffee bar they sell amazing coffee. The cold brews are very good, served in cute medicine bottles. They even have cold brewed coffee on tap, which is fresh and tasty. I also tried an earl grey cheese cake which was superb. Prices are -not surprisingly -higher than on any average kopitiam, but lower than most of those corporate coffee-shops we all know so well.

Some people admit it, most of us don't, but we all have a tiny little hipster deep inside us. And that tiny little hipster loves this kind of coffee bars. So, why not embrace the hip and treat ourselves with high-quality coffee? This is a place worth visiting, repeatedly.",5/4/2016,Food & Beverage
Chye Seng Huat Hardware,4,"For the coffee lovers - pretty basic with their coffee menu; does have quite a good pastry/ cake selection; even pastas and Rosti as well. Was pretty satisfied with my latte though I would have preferred them to have syrup on their selfservice condiments counter - I like my coffee sweet. 
Their lemonade was really well made too, like a fizzy mojito without the alcohol. 
The ambience and facade of a hardware store was also very interesting.",14/2/2016,Food & Beverage
Chye Seng Huat Hardware,4,"From the same roaster as Papa Palheta (also the roaster's name), Pulp and Loysel's Toy and the coffee here is the same quality but in a cooler and more hipster like setting of an old hardware store. Here they have a very nice cafe part as well as a roasting and tasting annex and some outdoor seating.

The coffee is good without being spectacular but the presentation of the filter coffee is very nice when they serve in cute little bottles. The espresso based coffees are also good and the cakes and pastries are too good to not eat one or two (or occasionally even more). The food is standard cafe fare and I have been rather underwhelmed by the quality so would come here for the coffee, the cakes and nice setting.

Service is usually friendly and if you sit sit the bar it tends to be more talkative. One drawback is the lack of free wifi but perhaps intentional to not have people sit around for too long.",8/1/2016,Food & Beverage

Latte - I've had better ones. I like my coffee robust and rich. This one is quite there yet. After hearing all the hype, I have to say I am a tad disappointed.

Coffee ale - interesting. It reminds me of a light stout, but not something I'd crave.

Banana cake - probably the best thing here for me. Moist and banana-y.

Good to go if I am in the neighborhood but not enough to make it a destination. It's so popular these days that it is virtually impossible to get a spot indoors. If you come in a group (more than 3 or 4), you probably have to sit out in the yard. Not exactly fun if the weather is hot like these couple of weeks.",28/10/2012,Food & Beverage

Chye Seng Huat Hardware,3,"Reviewing the evening bar, not the coffee (I'm sure Papa Palheta deserves their reputation but I'm firmly in the Nylon camp). 

The beers were expensive as expected, and nothing special. My amber ale tasted like Tiger with food colouring. The special was a low alcohol lager infused with mandarin peel and tasted just like it sounded, but it was, to be fair, $8 a pint. There were only 4 choices and I wanted none of them. I suspect there were bottled beers on offer (one of the staff was sipping some) but without a menu or any kind of visibility it would be hard to order them. 

Just down the road are Char and 1925, the former serves Hobgoblin and the latter has decent home brews, better options if beer is what you're after.

The DJ's volume was too high so the evening ended in sore throats. It's strange because there is no dance floor nor dancing. At around 10pm the DJ changed and the sound was pushed even higher. At this point we were screaming at each other, gave up after 5 minutes and moved on. 

The place seems to be a LBGT cruising spot and at least a third of the audience was visibly LBGT, as well as many on the staff. 

The food looked like normal pub food. Fries, mac n cheese, etc. I'd rather eat at the numerous hawkers (in fact that's what we did).

Young and hipster crowd mostly, many fashionable ang mohs. Loads of selfies and Instagram.

While there are few other similarly designed spaces in Singapore, such as A.R.C, or roasting their own beans, such as Common Man and Nylon, the Chye Seng Huat Hardware space is my by far my favorite.

Chye Seng Huat Hardware,5,"Chye Seng Huat Hardware - Top 3 Cuppa in Singapore


Chye Seng Huat Hardware ('CSHH') is the second outpost of Papa Palheta which located in the new headquarters for Papa Palheta. Instead of going the boutique way, such as in Bukit Timah establishment, CSHH is a full fledge café serving Coffee, Coffee flavoured beer, food and desserts. At the back of the café, you can see their workshop roasting machines. Beside the workshop is the Annex, this is where you can buy coffee beans and other coffee apparatus. The coffee school and gift shop can be located on the second floor. 

This time around, I decided to pop by for a quick shot of caffeine and a quick bite before my next appointment in Novena. 

The coffee here can be considered as one of the best roasted coffee beans in Singapore. Just check with the crowds flocking this place every day. With the third wave coffee movement hitting its stride in Singapore, you can be sure that you will get a good cuppa just by judging the Rosetta latte art in your coffee. If it does not have one or the rosetta does not look good, you better lower your expectations. 

Most of the time, CSHH will be using their own blend of coffee bean which is known as Terra Firma for their milk base coffee, such as cappuccino, latte, other variety. Their coffee is smooth, dark with a slight chocolate flavour at the end. The best part, is that you will not need to add sugar into it.

For food, this is the first time around I have a grub here. Ordered The BLT sandwich, and it does not disappoint. The bacon and bread is nice and crispy. The tomato and lettuce inside the sandwich is fresh. They serve the sandwich with chips and mesclun salad with Italian dressing. 

Overall, the quality of the coffee here is excellent. The top 3 best coffee in Singapore in my opinion. Don't forget to check out The Annex for coffee beans and coffee apparatus.  Cheers!!

Chye Seng Huat Hardware,4,"OK, as far as the roast quality and barista-ship goes, I'm a fan of Papa Palheta. I think the coffee here is probably the best in Singapore. That's where it ends for Chye Seng Huat however. I get that it's trendy & cool, with the pseudo-industrial layout and the name that harks back to Singapore's roots. I'm down with all that. But the place on weekends is a madhouse. 

No table service means long queues to order coffee. I've sometimes had to wait 15 minutes in queue just to get an order in. Hell if they were serving $1 kopitiam stuff I'd probably be fine with that but considering the prices here, a bit of table service wouldn't be too much to ask. But if people are willing to queue then table service would probably be bad business.

Similarly, I assume, comfortable seating with ample space would be bad business. Why give people space & comfort when you can pack them in & contort them like sardines? Turn those covers! Good business, Papa. Good business.

Related side-note: I once saw two rather portly gentlemen and one very large lady try to squeeze themselves onto their bar-stools. It was... uncomfortable to watch. I actually had to look away.

I'm also not a huge fan of the food, which is 90% misses with very few hits. I frequent this joint reasonably often as it's near where I live. On my last visit I ordered a benedict. The eggs were overcooked and the ham... my God the ham. It was that radioactive pink colour. I'm not even sure that it was technically ""ham"". Well maybe technically but it sure didn't taste like it.

So what's a four star rating doing accompanying a review that sounds this bad? The coffee is that good, guys.",26/12/2013,Food & Beverage
Chye Seng Huat Hardware,5,"Disclaimer time: I have to admit my review is a little biased - I used to work with these guys, and I'm ever so proud of what they've done.

Chye Seng Huat Hardware, or CSHH, (or Ah Huat, if you will) is really the evolution of the Papa Palheta coffee journey, which began just over three years ago (three years and two days, as of this review).

This place is in a word - cool. You can come here for three things:
1. A coffee.
Beans are roasted by the team in their other locations, but operations will be centralised to the Workshop (in the adjacent building in the near future). 
Your beverage is made before you, in the island bar, and you can see the baristas in action, no matter if it's an espresso-based coffee, or one of the many other filter brews.

2. On quieter days, a conversation.
Talk to the baristas - the island bar is built for interaction, and ask them why the do things a particular way. Like why your filter coffee has water poured in a particular fashion, and the importance of the right temperature.

3. A taste experience.
If you're a little more keen, call ahead to book a session at the Annex. You can geek out with a few of your friends over the intricacies of flavour in each small-batch-roasted origin, and even get some off-the-menu treats as flavour pairings.

If you're mega-geeking it out, there's number 4. An education.
They do barista training upstairs as well, so if you've wanted to get behind the coffee counter, here's where you can start.

As a barista, I can't think of many other places I would want to be/work at. and If you're as much of a coffee geek as me, you'll feel the same way.",21/9/2012,Food & Beverage
Chye Seng Huat Hardware,3,"Cold brew coffee was spot on! Strong, smooth and served ice cold, it was perfect! Space is very cool - industrial vibes galore. Menu looks very unique and cool.

Chye Seng Huat Hardware,2,"The good: Fantastic space, very friendly staff (smiles and was asked if my coffee was good) considering it was packed. The crumble cake was decent and the coffee I drank was surprisingly tasty. I'm not a huge coffee fan but when I do, it's full of sugar. This one (bright brew) I drank straight up and loved it. Cudos. 

The bad: Selection lacks. From food to drink options, I struggled to find anything I really wanted to order. Mentally I was prepared for breakfast, which they didn't have. Another huge bummer, no soy. It's Asia, almost 40% (could be way off, but it's high) of people are lactose intolerant. Need a non dairy option stat!  Another thing was the music, I was only there for 25 minutes and heard the same song twice.  Saw a record player playing spinning, but it seems it's there for show and not to actually play music.  If I'm wrong, mix up the records, if I'm not, plug it in and let people play the records they want to hear. Turntables are not meant to be props.    

The ugly: Couldn't fit my finger in the cup handle, how am I suppose to drink?! Almost dropped it a few times while sipping, which would have been extra embarrassing since it seemed everyone there is there to stare at each other.",13/10/2012,Food & Beverage
Chye Seng Huat Hardware,5,"CSHH is the new flagship venue of the Papa Palheta group. Located on Tyrwhitt Road (beside Jalan Besar stadium), CSHH is a roastery, retail space and coffee academy. The Steeping Room - previously a pop up space at Bras Basah - makes a welcome return in the form of the Annexe, a dedicated area for coffee and food pairing.  

Papa Palheta cafes tend to have a very distinct decor, feel and atmosphere - CSHH is no exception. The original shell of the hardware store is intact, with art deco lettering and exposed light fixtures enhancing the effect. The interior is bright, airy and contemporary - a new lease of life for one of the old workshops that was here before. Combined with a large retail space, this is not unlike Barista Jam in Sheung Wan, Hong Kong - a venue I like a lot.  

As always, I started by ordering an Espresso. The blend used was a combination of 
Brazilian Coromandel, Guatamelan Antigua and Ethiopian Sidamo. In general, Brazilian and Guatamelean coffees have hints of chocolate, and low acidity, while Ethiopian sidamo has a smooth aftertaste. The shot had an intense aroma, with a dark brown crema, indicitave of freshly roasted beans. There was a syrupy mouthfeel that I typically notice in shots from third wave outlets - this is an indicator that the shot has been extracted for the correct amount of time. The intensity and robust body of the shot was evident from the first tasting - the combination of dark chocolate paired with a citrus, floral notes gives rise to a complex, long lasting bouquet with perfect balance. The aftertaste lingers, and I could taste it long after I had finished my shot. Some things are simply better in their places of origin - like eating chicken rice in Singapore, or drinking Guinness in Dublin, drinking a Papa Palheta blend in CSHH was a coffee experience to savour. There were more notes, flavour and mouthfeel in the last few drops than in any number of shots from other cafes.

I ordered a Cappuccino also. It arrived with beautiful latte art and dark brown foam - a nice contrast of light and darkness. There was a lovely foamy, light texture with an intense coffee hit a few seconds later. The espresso did not dominate in this drink, even though it was a strong shot - the milk and espresso work in conjunction, a 1-2 punch straight to the pallete, where one hits right after the other. They accentuate each other rather than fight for dominance on your taste buds. The layer of foam on top was the correct thickness also - a simple thing, but not something that every cafe gets right.

The retail space is large and well stocked, with Chemex woodneck products, Hario Buono kettles paired with V60 pourover rigs, Aeropress and syphons all on display. There were 5 bean varities available also, which can be bought whole, or ground on request. Professional espresso machines and grinders are available. This is significant - the staff are are baristas who use machines such as these each day, rather than sales people who may receive commission for recommending a particular type.

Some other notable points are the menu, which has a wide variety of brewing types, and clever pairings of food to coffee. Also, I like the pairing of Jungle Beer (brewed in Admiralty) and Papa Palheta coffee - this is entirely consistent with the creative approach of Papa Palheta. I have not yet tried the Annexe, where food, coffee and alcohol pairings are explored more fully, but based on the work that has been done in CSHH to date (and from one or two experiments that are being prepared at present), this is something to look forward to.

In short, it's some of the best coffee that I've had. The original Papa Palheta at Hooper Road may be no more, but the same intense, robust and complex shots live on in a quiet street at Jalan Besar.",18/3/2013,Food & Beverage

Actually, I'm just bitter that they got rid of their original french toast. The brioche one with loads of banana slices and swimming in maple syrup. Add a bit of powder sugar, almond slices and we were golden.

Maybe I came back too late for a second helping because last time I went it was no more. I didn't get what I came for and instead got a really sad looking plate of what they wanted to pass off as french toast.

Chye Seng Huat Hardware,3,"After walking up a narrow stair case that gave the impression of hidden wonders I was greeted into a small room that appeared to be something out of Alice in wonderland, the room was very small and in every way taken over by coffee machines of all sorts and sizes so finding space to sit was a little tough. 

Turns out they are renovating the downstairs cafe so this is more of a pop up store in the meantime. If you don't mind sitting amongst the makers of natures nectar (coffee machines) which I didn't, it was actually a very nice experience to sit and collect my thoughts. 

There wasn't a good selection of food but understandable as they currently don't have a kitchen. 

I'd love to come back in Feb once they have finished the renovations and see what treats are in store.

Because you'll not be able to appreciate the coffee - tried the latte and house brew but couldn't tell the difference between this coffee and others. I think the food here is decent (tried the pancakes and french toast) but there are better places for food if you're really hungry. I can imagine this being a nice chill out place but when I reached on Saturday afternoon is was just super crowded, and packed to the brim. Managed to get seats but I found them squeezy and it was hard to get past the long line of people at the counter.

Featuring an island bar counter for you to watch the baristas at work, this joint promises a lot to come in terms of enjoying coffee. (I'm still reeling in all the information.)

That aside, I dropped by early today for breakfast. Had the cold brew which was served in a medicine bottle-like jar. Very symbolic for how potent it is. I like it watered down slightly by the ice. Also had their breakfast in a cup which was a mix of tomatoes, herbs and eggs baked in a ramekin. Interesting concept which can do with more shaking up.

I like how they continue to surprise. This one is one to watch.",13/8/2012,Food & Beverage
Chye Seng Huat Hardware,4,"Chye Seng Huat is a welcome addition to the cafe scene, in my opinon. With the recent cafe craze and mass genesis of indie/third wave cafes, CSHH really is a standout for a number of reasons.

The space is really interesting. It looks like like a hardware store shophouse that isn't in use from the front. But if you walk in through the metal gate next to the shophouse shutter doors, then you're greeted with a hive of activity and a large courtyard area. 

The most interesting feature for me is the roastery. CSHH is owned by the people behind Loysel's Toy and Papa Pahleta's and I hear the coffee beans used at all three establishments are roasted at CSHH. 

The cafe area also has a unique layout/configuration, with a bar style coffee making area in the centre of the room. There are seats around the bar.

The coffee itself is also really good. I like the new cold brew, though my latte was a little flat when I visited.",2/9/2012,Food & Beverage
Chye Seng Huat Hardware,3,"The location (tucked away in Jalan Besar with a nondescript entrance ) and concept (nostalgic exterior) makes CSHH a go to place for people looking for something more than just a cup of coffee.
However, the lacklustre mains really let this place down. The food tasted and looked like cold fast food. I had pancakes with sour cream and smoked salmon, topped with beansprouts. It looked and tasted like it was hastily put together. The chicken wrap and banana cake were better and more enjoyable.
Having said that, the coffee is, like what the other reviewers have said, quite good. And I would pop by here for a cup if I am ever in the area. But I would hesitate to recommend it to people who want to come all the way down to have a meal.",31/8/2013,Food & Beverage

Don't expect a place like this to ever be empty-if you want a seat you'll be waiting and or jumping in front of someone to take it, but the ambiance is cool, the music was nice and it was a  great place to hangout. I ended up buying some beans here from their own blend-again the prices being very reasonable (10-18 SGD a bag) against the USA and other Singapore coffee shops. I must say the area throws you off a bit. It appears to be in a residential area with hardware stores around but the area is for sure in the process of changing.

I'm staying in Little India about 20 minute walk from CSHH. Let me start by saying there are barely any places to get coffee in the vicinity of my hotel so my gf and I walked a few blocks to 20F coffeehouse which was closed due to renovation. A guy who worked there recommended CSHH after I asked him if there was anywhere else to get coffee in the area. Although the menu prices were shocking, by the time we finally got to CSHH we were too hungry and in need of coffee to find yet another place to have breakfast. Needless to say it cost $48 for two of us to have a mediocre breakfast in a super busy cafe with no wifi (it's also confusingly half order-and-get-your-own-stuff and half waitress run... I was instructed to get my own napkins across the restaurant when I asked the waitress who delivered our food).

I arrived with a donor of the museum who gave me an expectantly unique tour. He took me there to see the famous Chinese ink brush artists as well as a few contemporary Chinese painters. I was blown away with the level of skill required to complete some of the work. I also got to see other Asian artists from the Philippines and Indonesia which is something I don't get to see at home or even in Europe. It was a rare opportunity for me to see artists from other regions who were making beautiful work for centuries unbeknownst to me. 
They also have these cool sky bridges that connect one side of the museum to the other that make for excellent photo ops. There is a roof top bar with a nice view of the skyline as well. This was a good stop and a really cool experience.

For a while I had thought that the only art gallery in Singapore was this one near Bras Barash MTR station, and all that one seemed to do was have modern art exhibitions. Well, this is the place to visit if you are looking for a more traditional experience. Okay, it does have a modern art section, but that is generally expected. The gallery itself is quite large, and when we paid it a visit it was free entry, which was a bonus. There were also a number of galleries, including two which contained temporary exhibitions (one of then being works from the d'Orsay).

We booked our tickets online in advance to avoid lines.  We went late on a weekday and felt like we had the place to ourselves.  The exhibit is breath taking, and a must see.  It's rare to view genius art of this caliber from someone who is still alive!  It is unlike any other exhibit I have seen.  It is definitely an experience.  She literally takes you into the piece of art itself.  I felt like I was Alice in Wonderland and had jumped into a hole into another dimension.  

The National Gallery itself is housed in two national monuments: former Supreme Court and City Hall. The building goes back to 1929, and if the walls could speak they could tell the story of Singapore's colonial times too independence.

General admission is 20 SGD, to visit the Yayoi Kusama exhibit is 25 SGD, and an all access pass is 30 SGD.

What amazed me about the new National Gallery was their southeast Asian art galleries. They had artworks dating back to the 1800s from this region, and it truly fascinated me. 

As a person who loves museums, I've always admired European paintings though I could never relate to them. However, when I noticed the artwork by Philippine artists, for the first time I actually felt connected to the art. It's hard to explain. I guess the idea of seeing portraiture and thinking, ""Wow, this family looks like me!"" or ""Wow! This is how Filipinos used to dress back then! Is that what my ancestors wore?"" helped me understand where I came from. Being born American with Filipino heritage, it was as if I finally experienced my heritage for the first time.

There is so much to see here that I was truly overwhelmed and couldn't do it all in one sitting. I definitely want to come back and re-visit the galleries that focus on contemporary southeast Asian art, along with re-discovering identity post colonization.

National Gallery Singapore,5,"The National Art Gallery is located in two historical buildings with British Colonial style architecture - the City Hall and the former Supreme Court building.

There are many exhibits and the main feature is called ""Siapa Nama Kamu?"" which means ""What is your name?""  The paintings all reflected the rich history and culture of Singapore (and the surrounding Southeast Asian countries).  The main theme is to examine issues related to Singaporeans as individuals as well as a community, and to see Singapore through its art.

Outside the main gallery (DBS Singapore Gallery) is the Social Table, which let visitors digitally choose a collection of artworks and build their own posters (see picture).  Once you are done you'll enter your email address, and the poster will be emailed to you in a jpeg file.

This is REALLY cool because the artworks that you select represent how you see Singapore through its art.  Each person's selection is unique; each person's perspective of Singapore is different.  Your selection is your answer to the question ""Siapa Nama Kamu?""

In the picture posted, you can see yours truly's view of the culture and evolution of Singapore through its art, and my answer to the question ""What is your name?""  My name is my image of Singapore.

Besides the main feature, there were numerous other exhibits and galleries.  There are literally too many to mention, but two of them are particularly memorable:

-- Rediscovering Treasures: Ink Art from Xiu Hai Lou, which is a collection of Chinese painting and calligraphy.

-- Walk, Walk, Walk: Search, Deviate, Reunite, which is a digital collection from Japanese ""ultratechnologists"".  These high-tech artworks respond to the visitor's touch, movement, body heat, and voice.  Absolutely amazing!  (This is the first gallery to your left as you walk away from the ticket counter, and is naturally the first gallery to visit.)

If you are a lover of art, history, and culture; allocate at least half a day to truly enjoy and appreciate the National Art Gallery.  To kill two birds with one stone, while you are there, have lunch or afternoon tea at the National Kitchen by Violet Oon (please see separate review.)

One thing that I thought it was really cool about the Museum is that they have the largest collections of art from South East Asia. I think most National Galleries around the world, focus so much on artists from other countries, that they sometimes forget about their own local ones; so I was really happy to see that Singaporean artists were given the recognition they deserved in this Gallery. 

The main reason why I'm giving it 3 stars is the way is set up. I swear I spent 50% of my time here trying to figure out where to go. We got lost like 5 times, and it was really frustrating to just walk to empty or closed rooms. After a while we realized that a bunch of exhibits were actually closed, so it was a bummer that nobody let us know in advance, instead of wasting our time trying to figure out where to go. At the end we just felt so lost and cold in that huge building that we decided to leave.

In their prior lives, one building was used for municipal services and office for the Prime Minister.  The 2nd building was for their justice dept  and where the Chief Justice's office was. 

The proclamation of separation from Malaysia can be seen in the former office of the past Chief Justice.  Lovely art work over 5 floors. But the bottom floor is mostly play areas for kids. There is a roof view with a solar pond. We had a small lunch at the restaurant that serves local food. Another serves Western food. The beef satay was delicious for $9, 5 small skewers.

For non locals, $20 SD per person. We spent the entire day there. Pick up a map because the layout is confusing between the 2 buildings which only connect on 3 floors. 
The dome is not for touring but you can see it from underneath.",28/5/2019,Arts
National Gallery Singapore,4,"National Gallery has gone through a restoration and I would highly recommend locals and tourists alike to visit!

There are vast amounts of space and galleries deep in, so have fun getting lost. There are plentiful of signs around and I would encourage you to go by sequence from Gallery 1 to 6.

The Supreme Court exhibits caught my eye as it showed preserved artifacts and the grandeur of a courthouse.

Parents can head to the children's activity rooms on Level 1 or B1 whereby building blocks and interactive exhibits awaits. 

There are also water coolers located near the bathrooms,so keep your bottle handy as there will be alot of walking.

Do head to level 6 to take a panoramic shot of our nation's landmarks of the Padang,Esplanade and Marina Bay Sands (MBS)

Food options range from the Padang cafe to violet oon (peranakan cuisine) and a little cafe posing as a small cafeteria serving at level 1. Get your coffee and bake goods here. There are more food options but at this point, my calfs were giving way.

Would come back again as I felt I didn't cover a few sections as much as i like.",12/6/2016,Arts
National Gallery Singapore,4,"Came here the second day it was open! Bahah getting to these things all ahead of time.. and then while looking around realized that a lot of the exhibitions weren't open until Nov 26 :(. Oh well. 

The Museum is FREE until December 6, 2015 so book your tickets ahead online or you can walk right in and they'll give you a pass. When I went on Wednesday there was barely anyone there. 

The building itself is spectacular. Everything is so gorgeous - it's the perfect place for taking pictures. The chairs that they have around the museum are so quirky and unique (Yeah I paid more attention to their chairs than their art opps). I also enjoyed seeing the former Supreme Court Building. Their rooms are just so elegant you have to come check it out while you can :).

There's also a free shuttle that runs between the other museums (National Art Gallery and National Museum and one other) so you can go around and get your museum fill for the day.",28/11/2015,Arts
National Gallery Singapore,2,"The Central/ Orchard central of museums -- expect to get lost!

2 stars for the beautiful building. Zero stars for the so-so art.. granted, I'm just an ordinary person and not an art critic but there is no single piece I remember, writing this 2 weeks after my visit.

If I could give negative stars, I would, for the terrible layout.  The signs are unclear and incomplete and even with a map, we found ourselves reaching dead ends more than once. We weren't the only ones getting lost and frustrated-- other groups expressed confusion to the guides, and the guides had to show us the way to certain halls, through staircases and doors that were not clearly marked on the map. 

So, in the 3 hours we spent there, 2 hours were on walking and finding the way, half an hour looking at art, half an hour trying to appreciate it-- the labels and signs on the art don't do it any favors.",12/3/2016,Arts
National Gallery Singapore,2,"Really boring. Lots of space with few nice art pieces.  Hoping to get Southeast Asian art that really expressed the feelings of people as they went through the various times in history as well as showing love of country. It was rather hodgepodge like and not that interesting. There was one section that was done by an autistic artist; as a person who works with autistic people, I found it to be something that autistic people would find quite disturbing in a negative way. Too much color, too much stuff and filled with trash-like items, my Autistic students would probably run out screaming. Only saving grace was the fantastic children's section. Of course, everybody working throughout the museum was nice.",4/2/2020,Arts
National Gallery Singapore,3,"Certainly not comparable to other National Galleries in the top cities of the world but a worthy effort. The emphasis here, of course, are all things Singaporean.

More than one visit is unnecessary except for possibly the rotating special exhibitions.",12/9/2017,Arts

National Gallery Singapore,5,"Beautiful space and Asian artwork, I really enjoyed walking around and visiting the gallery. The building however was not all gallery it was a bit confusing to navigate the gallery skipped floor and all. The roof was interesting it was a pool of water on the top so you could see the movement of the water from below. There was also the supreme holding cell that we visited it was kinda of fun. There were a few cafes and museum stores, random but one carried Maison Kitsune clothes though for man only. The highlight of the visit was going to the rooftop, there was a restaurant up there with an amazing view of Singapore! Worth visiting!",13/3/2016,Arts
National Gallery Singapore,3,"The National Gallery is a beautifully restored building that still has all that grandeur feeling you get from those buildings in similar architecture like those in Europe. Even if you're not that excited about artworks, I believe it is still worth a visit just to walk through the building as it was simply stunning. (a great place to bring your guests i suppose)

The National Gallery also hosts a vast collection of Southeast Asian artworks ranging from local artists to artists from neighbouring countries. Although the collection brings me back to my days of studying those artworks, the arrangement of the artworks felt quite random which makes it less appealing in terms of its presentation as well for its discussion (some museums group artworks with related theme or characteristics together to evoke discussions). In addition, the lack of guidance, whether in form of text or audio, makes it harder for people who are not that familiar to the SEA art scene to understand and appreciate it fully. 

More could be done to introduce people to the SEA art scene but I'm glad that some efforts are being devoted to fulfil this purpose.",17/6/2016,Arts
National Gallery Singapore,4,"My mistake when visiting the museum is to come in the afternoon. The place is humongous and we could only cover half of the museum before retiring. Great collection of Art inside a beautiful and historical building. Don't forget to check out the view from the rooftop of the Padang and the Marina Bayfront.
I would have given it another star if it was easier navigating the building. Got lost midway with a dead-end and had to backtrack, which ruined the rhythm. 
All in all a great experience with some interactive work, and also several fun stations for the young (and young at heart).",7/9/2016,Arts

 Its quite difficult to navigate around though, there weren't enough signages that were placed strategically. I ran into the same sections over and over again. 

'Wu Guan Zhong's exhibit were the highlights for me. Else, a big portion of the art didn't leave much of an impression for me. There's plenty to see and might take more than a day to complete. I definitely want to come back and re-visit the galleries that focus on contemporary southeast Asian art, along with the modern contemporary art installations that was pretty intriguing.",23/3/2016,Arts

The two main buildings have been completely refurbished and are magnificient and comfortable.  The showings rotate, so while I was there, the two I enjoyed were the earthenware and the wall hangings.  Really well done.  The art work goes from colonial to modern and is very well laid out with good descriptions.  I did not rush at all and spent about 4 hours there.  Highly recommed that you spend a few minutes to really understand the museum layout and what floors the exhibits are on(you'll see what I mean when you get there), then you will be able to work your way through in a natural progession.",24/8/2017,Arts

National Gallery Singapore,4,"Love the fact that the museum combines two historic buildings (Supreme Court and City Hall), but unfortunately the two sides are not well integrated. A gigantic underground basement connects the two as does what used to be an alleyway between the two (but which is now ""covered"" to become a link way). It's disorienting moving from one side of the museum to the other. There's a lot of space (much underused) and it's almost too big, which adds to the feeling of being lost. I didn't have time for walking on my own as I'd joined a tour. The tour was enjoyable and instructive. The docent seemed knowledgeable and engaged us. I liked the variety of artwork, especially pieces that were contemporary and abstract. Often museums showcase so-called traditional arts so this proved refreshing.",23/3/2016,Arts
National Museum of Singapore,4,"A great place to learn about the history of Singapore. Highly recommend taking the guided tour at 11 AM. Tixs are $12 per person SD. Our docent was a retired pilot who spent 1 hr 40 mins taking the group thru the gallery.  He was excellent and knew his history well and passionate about sharing his knowledge. 
The museum is very modern and pretty. Several things to see besides Singapore's past history, also modern growth since the 1920s onward in the upstairs area and an animated 3D area with a sky fall of flowers and a forest of local animals, habitat, and flowers. I found it to be dark for the animated portion but it was very pretty. 

There is a section which talks about all the colonial occupation of Singapore including the Japanese occupation during WW2 and the suffering endured by the Singaporeans. When we were in Japan 2 yrs ago, the museum in Japan made their war invasion sound like a patriotic thing and how their citizens suffered and the recovery efforts after they surrendered.  No mention of their atrocities to the countries they invaded nor regrets or public apologies.  

There is a tiny cafe on the bottom floor if you are in need of rest or nourishment.",24/5/2019,Arts
National Museum of Singapore,3,"As far as national museums go, this appears to need a major overhaul. Completely skipping the Dutch influence on Singapore's history is a major faux-pas especially considering how Singapore wants to be seen as inclusive. They apparently had no problem setting up a comprehensive display on the brutal Japanese occupation and that was only three years. For the admission price the facility leaves a lot to be desired though the effort made is certainly commendable.",21/10/2018,Arts

National Museum of Singapore,4,"I was visiting Singapore for a few days, and as someone who is used to dry heat, the Singapore humidity is a lot to handle, especially midday. As such, it was important to us to find things to do that would be both interesting and allow us to escape the heat. One of the things we did was to check out the National Museum.

As the name suggests, this is a museum dedicated to all things Singaporean. The exhibits detail Singapore's history throughout the years, and smaller exhibits will go into more detail of certain eras or certain facets throughout the ages (e.g.: pop culture, fashion, plants). Even if you're not a huge history buff, I think that you can definitely find something interesting.

One of my favorite exhibits was the special Story of the Forest exhibit created by teamLab. It has digital images projected onto the walls. Maybe not everyone would find it interesting, but I happen to be a fan of teamLab's work!

Although all the descriptions are provided in English, they did have handouts in 3 other languages for non-English speakers. This was useful for my mom, as she reads and understands Chinese a lot more easily than English.

Overall this is not a bad way to escape the heat for a few hours. You'll be able to see some interesting things, while learning more about the development of Singapore as a country.",17/8/2017,Arts
National Museum of Singapore,3,"The building is flashy and the interior itself is worth seeing. If you're a Singaporean PR, you can get in for free, otherwise, it's not too much to pay either.

I give this place three stars because most of the exhibitions here are from other countries. Yes, granted that people of Singapore did come from many other places and they're all immigrants so to speak but there aren't many interesting contents in the museum apart from the time when they were colonised by the Great Britain. 

Museum-wise, it's ok, bordering on the must see, because what else do you do in Singapore after eating laksa and chilli crab, right? (Kidding), but Chinese Heritage Museum gives you so much more story than this place.",23/6/2017,Arts
National Museum of Singapore,3,"The previous time I was in Singapore I gave this place a miss, namely because I thought that it was basically a natural history museum. However, as it turned out, it had nothing to do with natural history and eveything to do with the city of Singapore. Basically the museum looks at the whole period of the city from the prehistoric eras, through colonialism, World War II, and the birth of the Island republic (and the problems that arose therein). It is interesting, but really only if you are hugely keen on knowing more about the city itself, or are bored and looking for something to do. As for me, I found it interesting, but not hugely fantastic.",14/1/2017,Arts

The second floor of the museum is Singapore through the decades.  That portion was a bit fun, especially the 1950-60s room.  Lots of reminiscing for my mom.  I guess the culture over in Hong Kong wasn't too different during that decade.",16/11/2016,Arts
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Good place for a quick rundown on Singapore's history.
Ground floor is currently about the late Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who was instrumental in making Singapore what it is today. 
The lower floors are about Singapore's history: how the major ethnic groups (Chinese, Malays, Indians) came here, and what they did.
Also, some colonial history, and about the Japanese occupation of Singapore during the 2nd World War.

The National is located at the bottom of Fort Canning Hill on Stamford Road. Nonresident entrance is $10SD. 

After being a bit disoriented from the video walk, I almost missed the slightly hidden entrance into the main museum. Here was the Singapore History Gallery covering Singapura, a Crown Colony to today. 1299-1818 prehistoric tools, early writings, and early trading. 1819-1941 the arrival of Sir Stamford Raffles and new trading lines, and the beginning of the Crown Colony. 
1942-1945 WWII struggles and occupation. 
1945- present how Singapore separates from Malaysia and becomes an independent nation. This part was fascinating, as they ran authentic news coverage of the President giving his speech of the changes that were about to happen.

Try the exhibit downstairs, which makes it interactive. Children will have fun with the treasure hunt activity.

The one area that stopped me from giving five stars: high priced food at Cafe Brera. We were looking for a cultural experience but the cafe is pretty standard western fare at an exorbitant cost. 

Traveler's tip: for a bit more of a cultural immersion, take a break for lunch, leave the building (make sure your museum stickers are on you so you can return), cross the street over to the Singapore Management University and take the escalator down to their basement to reach their canteen/food court. Just ask any student to point you to the right direction. The food there is diverse, excellent, and you will probably get the full family fed for the price of one entree at Cafe Brera back at the museum. Hot tip: try the Korean hawker for some amazing kimchi dishes (they can make it vegetarian on request).

If Cafe Brera had more of a Singapore touch, featuring kopi and Singapore snacks, we would have considered it.",28/6/2025,Arts

You are then free to go back and fill in the gaps at your own pace.

The gallery itself was well designed. I especially loved the rotunda exhibit and I appreciated the thoroughness of the history telling without it being propaganda-y. I learned a lot from today's tour!

National Museum of Singapore,5,"I am a sucker for museums, especially ""National"" museums representing a country.  The NMS is located in a prestigious English parliamentary type building with large columns, sweeping staircases, wide corridors and numerous wings.

The latter with film clips discussing the hard decision on the separation from Malaysia.  Quite poignant.  Artifacts throughout the exhibit including a Japanese WWII replica tank.

Second floor has an animation exhibition in the round and also streaming along a winding corridor depicting animals, trees, flowers, etc.. impressive to kids and adults.

Other exhibits on fashion, women's changing roles in Singaporean society, the benefits of government housing, changes between 70s and 80s Singapore.

This museums shows you the history behind this amazing metropolis and all the hardships they've been going through before and after their independence in 1965. This museum will definitely give you a greater understanding and appreciation of how this country works and how they've been so successful. During my visit I got to enjoy a special exhibit in World War II, which was very eye-opening. Growing up in Mexico and then moving to the United States, I only learned what happened in Europe and North America during WWII, and it was somewhat scary to learned everything the Japanese empire did in this side of the world during the same time period.

National Museum of Singapore,5,"A born and raised Singaporean, my first trip here was long overdue. This is a world-class museum of the history of Singapore, with plenty of interactive audio and video exhibits to tell Singapore's story from its roots as a sleepy fishing village to bustling global city-state. 

I thoroughly enjoyed my visit and spent 5-6 hours here by myself. I explored every nook and cranny and there was always something exciting to see. 

One of the highlights of my trip were the Glass Rotunda, which houses teamlab's Magic Forest interactive exhibit. If you're familiar with teamlab you'll know they make the most entrancing, magical interactive exhibits. When you first enter you'll be captivated by a large room with magical plants projected on the walls swirling around as ambient background music enveloping you. Amazing. There's also a larger room like that with comfy bean bags that you can lounge in and just soak in the atmosphere. I loved it so much I visited twice. 

Another highlight was the exhibit Life in Singapore: Surviving Syonan. It documents life under the Japanese Occupation and was completely fascinating. I've heard stories of the occupation but never visited an exhibit showcasing the documents and personal accounts beforehand. There is also a cute room with a heartwarming story of how a couple fell in love during those harsh times. This exhibit gave me great insight into the Japanese occupation and I loved every moment. 

The main exhibit, History of Singapore, is large, comprehensive, and beautiful. It covers Singapore's entire history and I believe Singaporeans and tourists alike should visit! 

Admission for Singaporeans and Permanent Residents is free - just flash your IC - and it's only $10-18 for non-residents. If you're on a budget, skip the special exhibit that's going on right now (what is not visible is not invisible) because it's not really worth $8. Its the kind of art that is only art because of what the artist writes about it. 

There are two cafes and a restaurant to choose from when you get hungry. Clean and beautiful bathrooms are everywhere. The architecture of the museum is both traditional and modern and will take your breath away.

A museum like ""The National Museum Of Singapore"" would be the best example. Underneath the glitzy hotels, and swanky retails.  lies a more profound Singapore. A history that started with the entire nation being tropical agrarian land.  Before the arrival of the westerners,  it was more ""Man Vs Wild"" than ""Crazy Rich Asians "".  
    It starts off with the indigenous people aka the Malays and their methods of cultivating land. Then the arrival of Chinese mainly from provinces of Hainan and other parts of south China who arrived as early as the 11th century. Both groups worked along side each other in the jungles. Later traders from India mostly from Tamil arrived. Museum murals depicted how each of the groups worked side by side.
    Later segments in museums depicts the arrival of Europeans and especially Stamford Raffle the founder of modern Singapore.  It focus the control of Singapore under the British East India Company. It was still a colony with current day Malaysia known as British Malaya  until 1962 when it joined Malaysia as a soverign nation.

Apart from the special exhibitions, there are several permanent exhibitions at the National Museum that tells retells the history of Singapore. It includes the Singapore Living Galleries (namely on food, fashion, photography, fashion, and film & wayang) and the Singapore History Gallery. For the living galleries, I would say I enjoyed the section on food the most! It is really telling of our country's culture, colorful and vibrant. There are even videos on the process of preparing the local dish, which keeps people interested and easy for tourists to understand our culture as well!

I like the Singapore History Gallery as well. Firstly, it takes on a story telling approach, which makes it more engaging. It covers the major national events in the development of Singapore, as well as personal stories of people from the past. It comes with an easy-to-operate multimedia handheld device called the companion, which facilitates the audio visual tour.

Plus for the WWII buff in me, the downstairs traveling exhibit covers the experience under Japanese occupation. I wish some of the exhibits had gone in to a bit more detail - I'm the guy who loves the most minute details about some of this stuff, but all in all, worth visiting.

In the exhibition on treasures from Ukraine, there is a bit at the end describing the importance of gold in Asian cultures as well. 

The permanent exhibitions are also quite worth exploring to find out about Singapore and our history. The Singapore History Gallery, in particular, offers a very personal interactive experience with your own audio companion and different paths that you can take throughout the exhibit. My only complaint is that there is insufficient time to cover all the exhibitions in the building in one day, which is a pity as there is so much to see.",13/8/2012,Arts
National Museum of Singapore,4,"This is the only museum I know that has galleries devoted to food!

Other than the special exhibitions, there are a few permanent exhibitions at the National Museum on the history of Singapore, such  as the Singapore Living Galleries (namely on food, fashion,  fashion, and film & wayang) and the Singapore History Gallery. I don' tfind the permanent exhibits tthat exciting, however. 

The historical building is a great place for taking photos. A friend of mine posed for dance pictures here. She  was featured recently in the Chinese newspapers and must say, they turned out beauttifully.",19/8/2012,Arts
National Museum of Singapore,5,"I highly recommend a visit; if only to escape the scorching heat/ humidity of midday S'pore. The history section on Singapore is amazing- I learnt so much about my own country, even though i grew up and lived there for almost 18 years. 
Worth every penny",25/3/2013,Arts
National Museum of Singapore,5,"Absolutely phenomenal. The NMS is one of the best museums I have every visited.  Beautiful building with terrific architecture both inside and out. For the main admission fee of $15 SGD, you get access to several art galleries and two exhibits on Singapore history. There is also one special exhibit that you need to pay extra for, which I opted not to pay extra for.  The art exhibits are okay (full disclosure I only had time to check out two), but in my opinion, the stars of the show are the history exhibits. There is one of the first floor that offers a fairly comprehensive overview of Singapore's history starting from pre-European contact through the present. I felt like I really learned a lot about the different eras in Singapore's history and there were plenty of cool artifacts, along with mNy different oral histories that you could listen to by picking up the receivers places along the walls. The past 100 years of Singapore was a smaller exhibit upstairs in a beautiful wing of the building. This was split into four parts, each in a different room: pre-war colonial era (through 1930s), Japanese occupation (1940s), post war / independence (1950s and 60s) and the beginning of the modern era (1970s and 80s). Each room gave an interesting snapshot of the era depicted. My favorite was the last one covering through the 1980s. It was quite elaborate, with a giant mosaic screen in the far wall facing two rows of stadium seats that were taken from the original Singapore Stadium. The screen changed every 30 seconds or so to show a new scene. There was also a second smaller room behind the giant screen that was set up like a drive in theatre complete with mock up cars that you could sit in to watch the short film that was playing on repeat. Brilliant.  Visit this museum. If you don't, you're really missing out.",25/11/2018,Arts
National Museum of Singapore,4,"I like to learn about the history of the countries (or city-states!) I visit and this was a perfect introduction to Singapore. I was fairly ignorant of Singapore's history before visiting the museum, but after I left I felt I had a much better understanding of how it came to be what it is today.",20/10/2019,Arts
National Museum of Singapore,5,"I had fun here as a tourist from USA. Loved the exhibits and the price is just about average. Great accommodations for kids as far as I can tell, with areas designed just for kids and whatnot. We easily spent 2 hours here, reading about the history of Singapore.",25/7/2016,Arts
National Museum of Singapore,5,"I traveled to Singapore by myself in the summer of 2011 and had a fantastic time here.  I'm not an expert on museums but I have visited several in Europe and Asia. This is by far my favorite museum in Asia.  Prior to my trip, I took a quick glance of the country's background so I was happy to see the collections of trinkets.  I felt the museum did an awesome job at presenting the history in a way that was entertaining and informative.  The bright green audio guide is probably the best device I've ever used at any museum in the world.",5/7/2013,Arts
National Museum of Singapore,4,"Great museum that focuses on the history of Singapore. Lots of rotating exhibits through a well-directed variety of galleries. Easily 2 hours spend inside. With cheap admission and air-conditioning, it seemed like a no-brainer to stop in to kill some time in the afternoon. Immaculately maintained and clearly updated regularly.",23/9/2015,Arts
National Museum of Singapore,5,"I was visiting Singapore for a work vacation and had the opportunity to check out the national museum.

Great museum.",26/2/2018,Arts

I would certainly advise anyone to take a few hour to visit.",15/4/2016,Arts

King's Locksmith,5,"Had an issue with tenants who would forget to lock the front door. Found these guys and called them around 9 am on Tuesday. He told me my 2 slam shut lock options and explained which would be the better one. I went with his decision and by 2 o'clock he was here to replace it. No complaints with the workmanship. Just what i wanted. And the price was super reasonable. So can't go wrong with King's lock for reliable, and fast work",23/4/2020,Retail
King's Locksmith,5,"No one likes to be in the position where they don't have any choice and must call an emergency locksmith. I know what that can feel like because I was in that awful position.

What I have found is that people today have more than the usual issues, a sign of the times, maybe, or for some that's just the way they generally are. Who knows?

I lucked out with Randy from King's Locksmith. If I could give him more than just the 5 stars I would. He's a definite breath of fresh air. A local emergency locksmith, who enjoys his craft and being able to help you out. I found him to be a problem-solver, a knowledgeable, skilled person who knew his craft well and more importantly, got the job done that was needed.

Sure, depending on your needs you may pay a little more, but he's upfront with the cost and he writes you a bill with King's Locksmith, his company, and his name signed on it, not somewhere else and with someone else's name. Peace of mind is very important to have.

The job he did for me required the lock he was using to be altered. This was his first time having to make that kind of alteration. He worked very hard to do it and he took a chance that it wouldn't work. So far he was successful and he made me a very happy customer.

I have put his company, King's Locksmith, into my phone book and if I ever need to have any emergency locks in the future, Randy from King's Locksmith will be the one I call. He is truly what servicing a customer is all about. Thank you Randy, for a job well done.",10/8/2022,Retail
King's Locksmith,5,"I can't say enough about King's Locksmith. I called and spoke with Randy, the owner, around 1:45p, and explained the situation. He said give them a few minutes and a technician would call me back to advise when they would be by. Randy was true to his word; within 20 minutes, the tech called to say he had another call and would arrive by 4:30p. Again, true to his word. Greg surveyed the situation, told me what needed to be done and by 5:15p, my issue was resolved. I couldn't be happier!

King's Locksmith,3,"After making me wait for the locksmith forever they did not even have the lock I wanted. Instead of telling me right away they showed up with an inferior lock instead of just telling me they don't have what I wanted so I could call someone else.

Justin came by with all the tools and parts he needed after I sent him a video of the faulty bolt lock. Everything was replaced in a timely manner and all is working like new - as it's an historic house with a century old door, he even compensated for slight misalignment so that the mechanism worked smoothly.

King's Locksmith,1,"We hired Kings Locksmith to replace one lock on our exterior door and add one additional lock on a different interior door.

The exterior door lock we replaced on February 26 was no longer locking after less than 4 months so I called them first thing this morning for an emergency repair.  Calls were clearly being routed to an answering service and I received one call back saying they would have someone call me within 5 minutes.  This song and dance went on for two hours before I called another company for what was obviously an emergency.  

The long and short of it is they were non responsive to an emergency on an installation they did less than four months ago.

We called Max's Locksmith and they were there within the hour to save the day.  Use them instead.",11/6/2024,Retail

I'm super picky when it comes to arrangements, as most places are pretty boring/generic. I came across Scott's and immediately fell in love with their style. Classy and elegant arrangements that don't look like your grocery store flower. In Yelp Search I typed ""Astoria, Queens"" to find a local shop. I spent an hour looking at stores websites but ended up here. In my mind I thought it  was just down the street...not realizing it was in Manhattan. At first delivery didn't go so well, but I reached out and Arina messaged me immediately apologizing letting me know it was outside of manhattan so they use a 3rd party delivery service. She made sure to have a fresh arrangement made and delivered today. The customer service is A+++ and I appreciate the quick and accommodating actions on their end.

Scott's had great reviews as well as a comprehensive and easy-to-navigate website that made it really easy to find and select an arrangement to be sent the very next day. (Despite placing the order in late in the evening.)

They immediately sent a confirmation email and then another email the next day that included a picture of the arrangement prior to delivery. The arrangement was beautiful, although I was a little surprised by the black vase for such bright, light and colorful spring arrangement. However, once I saw it delivered in a cute little bag and my sister specifically saying that they came in a ""chic"" vase, I realized the picture really didn't do the black vase justice. 

Flower delivery can be a bit pricey, but in NYC even more so. However, pricing was consistent with other businesses nearby and the quality of the flowers and the arrangements really do seem to be top notch.

Scotts Flowers NYC,3,"Seems like a solid event and delivery florist (ie $75+ bouquets), with very helpful staff, but I wasn't especially impressed by the selection of $30-$50 bouquets. The first tome I came in I was looking for a simple bouquet to bring as a hostess gift, and wasn't won over by the premade options. The guy helping me asked what I was looking for, so I gave him my budget and color scheme. He assembled a bouquet in the back, and presented it to me for approval. I thought it was kind of tacky, so I asked for a few of the ugly flowers and fillers to be swapped, like requesting eucalyptus instead of decorative green berries. He invited me to look in the fridge to pick stems out myself, which was perfect. The bouquet ended up being just what I wanted, simple, classy, and within my $30 budget. 

I liked it so much, in fact, that I returned with a coworker to purchase a bouquet for our supervisor's birthday. That experience was less stellar. We described what we were looking for and our price range ($35-40), and the staff member went to the back to have it assembled. After making us wait for more than 15 minutes, he presented a bouquet that looked really tacky. We asked that he swap the berries and Christmas-y elements for simpler foliage/flowers, and he returned awhile later with a bouquet that would only marginally nicer. When we hesitated, he intoned that the flowers he used were usually more expensive that the original ones, implying that he was doing us a big favor. The whole process was slow and uncomfortable; we paid and left even though we didn't love the bouquet. 

TLDR; the premade bouquets are mediocre, so satisfaction depends on who helps you put together a custom bouquet.",12/12/2018,Retail

The lovely representative took time to explore what I had in mind and made suggestions to ensure my hopes were realized. 
The flowers surpassed anything I might have imagined and my daughter was thrilled- saying: you know me so well. 
The photo she sent me of the arrangement made me so proud- it was stunning- all thanks to the artisans at Scotts.
Besides the perfect arrangement, the service was beyond any I've experienced. I gave the wrong address in Manhattan, but Olea discovered my error, found the correct address and ensured that the flowers found their way to the Birthday Girl by 3pm.

I was promptly given the partial refund. Thanks a lot. The arrangement does look pretty and I was probably too harsh in judging that due to the lack of the peonies

The roses typically die out within 4 days, which is discouraging when you pay over $100 for each arrangement. Also, They don't put the flower ""food"" that should come standard. 

I have them a 3 because the arrangements are breathtaking. But I just cannot justify that for the amount of time I actually get to enjoy them.

I have used this florist for many years and even recommended them to clients of my concierge business, That being said, I went significantly out of my way to personally walk to Scott's flowers as they have the highest review and was simply appalled  by how arrogant and rude the guy at the desk was.  I told him I was trying to send flowers to a non-doorman building, but wanted to keep it a surprise; his response was ""we don't play games"".  I guess he is confused between playing games and doing his job because as far as I am concerned, that is called customer service and they have ZERO.

I ordered the day before for delivery by 5pm the next day.   They arrived the next day  around noon, in plenty of time for her birthday dinner.

I think part of what sets Scotts apart (aside from the beautiful flowers) is the incredible service. The staff is very kind. A few weeks ago I was running late and called Scotts to pick up a boquet and Jonny Palliser stayed late just to make sure I got the boquet I needed. So nice of him! 
Another example is just this past week, when I emailed Briana Patten about the ""Designers Choice"" boquet. This option makes it very easy to select a style and type of arrangement that you think the receiver will enjoy.

Pearl River Mart,3,"This place is like one big souvenir shop for tourists visiting Chinatown. It's just too bad that it's quite the distance from Chinatown and instead located in SoHo. There's almost like no souvenir that you can't not find here! There are 3 levels to this place. 
Basement level has kitchenware, teapots and cups, mix of fake and real plants (decent looking fake flowers), water fountains, toys, all kinds of incese, and even a Chinese medicine space set up in the corner of the floor. Everything's neatly organized and there's enough room to browse without having to be worried about accidentally crashing into something fragile.
The main floor has food, lamps and night lights, greeting cards, all sorts of paper crafts, Chinese style clothing for both men and women as well as lots of little trinkets like purses, wallets and etc.
Their second is only accessible by the elevator. I was blown away by how gorgeous this floor looked. It could literally be someone's house with all the furniture, vases and statues they had lined up in the middle of the floor. It's just a shame that the store will be closing in December. I didn't buy anything because nothing caught my interest and everything was slightly more expensive that the prices I could find in Chinatown or even Flushing.",1/9/2015,Retail
Pearl River Mart,3,"The store is interesting enough, it sells an eclectic mix of items. Most of it, lower quality made-in-China type stuff (paper umbrellas, linen shoes, paper or cloth fans, paper lanterns, little buddha statues, shoddy kimonos, chi paos, china bowls, plates, soy sauces, vinegars, some asian candies, ganesha statues, gimmicky items etc.)

The first floor and basement carry the smaller things, and the third floor is filled with larger asian-inspired home furnishings (stools, large statues, vases). 

I didn't find the prices at Pearl Mart to be as low as some stores in Chinatown, but if you're looking to browse a random assortment of Asian Chinatown goods, this is the place.",21/4/2013,Retail
Pearl River Mart,4,"Very disappointed when we went. We expected a huge selection of items but learned after readying the yelp reviews when we were there that they have moved and downsized. We did a quick walk through but didn't see much that stood out compared to any other small market/store around. 

Wish the previous yelp reviews stood up to how it is now!",15/2/2017,Retail
Pearl River Mart,4,Such a cute store for everything Asian inspired. Needed flying lanterns and found a box with assorted colors. Tried looking online but they'd all be delivered too late for when they were needed.

Pearl River Mart,5,"L-O-V-E!
The best place around for Chinese goods. They sell so many different things here. From dresses to notebooks to candy. It's all pretty well priced, if not cheaper.

 I hung around the candy aisle with a few friends and literally bought the whole aisle. FOR CHEAP!
The candy is great and low priced!
I'll be coming back really soon.",29/1/2011,Retail
Pearl River Mart,4,"If you're in the SoHo area, a great place to peek in and look at their 'Oriental Trading Company' styled warehouse-like place. The top floor has your 'ethnic' clothing, complete with a hat with a braided ponytail for a look. They have slippers, dishware, random gadgets and toys. Going downstairs, there are also more cookware and at reasonable prices. You can find some pretty good bargains to stock up for your kitchen.

Pearl River Mart,4,"Pearl River Mart is a minimalist's nightmare.  No matter where you point your eyes you are guaranteed to see at least fifty objects.  You will want to pick up at least fifteen of them, and you will probably want to buy at least two.  Lucky for you, whatever you've just touched is likely to cost under ten bucks, so you can take it home and live your dreams.
When I have a whole afternoon to squander, I'll tuck into Chinatown proper and emerge with some serious treasures.  However, when I only have about an hour to spare but feel the urge to seek and horde goods, I head for Pearl River Mart and come home with an abundance of cheap, pretty dishes, four dollar shoes, and nifty 99 cent surprises to throw lovingly at my boyfriend's head.",10/11/2005,Retail
Pearl River Mart,5,"My friends brought me in here, and there's so much to look at here. There's a lot of random stuff in this store. I mean I found a giant ear in the shop....RANDOM! I had so much walking around here.

I ended up purchasing a cute children's mug with an adorable bunny on it as well a vapur pouch when I go out. Very useful and handy.

There's like two floors, and wahh man so much nice pottery in here. Like what do they not have!? o___o  

So, guys and gals if you wanna get your FUNG SHUI on, go here to buy some amazing stuff. OR if you wanna buy something for that special friend, family member,pet, etc. Then it's a nice place to find a gift here :)!

Pearl River Mart,4,"I have always wondered why people love Pearl River so much.  They have always received great publicity from the press and huge write-ups in magazines.  Even though they carry the same items that all of the stalls and shops in Chinatown have for more than half the price.  They moved from their shop in Chinatown to their larger location in Soho.

I think that people like it because it is a ton of merchandise presented in a more organized fashion.  The atmosphere is calming even though there is so much to look at due to the lofty open space, the décor, and the ambient music played.  My favorite thing to do here, especially in the summertime, is to buy a cold tea from the fridge downstairs and sit on the balcony to drink it and people watch.  They do have some great housewares, but you can find many of the same dishes in some of the grocery stores off  of Canal.

I recommend shopping both Chinatown first to make sure that you are not just buying the same thing at a higher price.",21/1/2010,Retail

3 floors of awesomeness. From kitchen tools, decorations, lamps, foods, drinks, to statues, religious stuff, ethnic clothing, tools, etc, SO MANY GOODIES and SO CHEAP. I'm so in love with this place, no more Ebay and waiting",2/9/2013,Retail
Pearl River Mart,4,"Excellent house-wares shopping. Pearl River's niche is presenting its asian-themed wares with nice presentation, layout, and helpful clerks. People are willing to pay for a better shopping experience to avoid the messy haggling and digging you'd do in Chinatown. 
The fact that MUJI is down the street made it worth the trick for me to go to SOHOSo, I'll chime in my two-cents that hasn't been said much here. I bought three bento boxes here to use for office lunches and they also had cute, affordable re-usable cloth grocery bags (I bought one at $1.50. Unheard of!). I didn't intend to visit Pearl River, I did it on a whim and found stuff!  I'd definitely go back for a browse again, you just never know what you'll find here.",6/3/2008,Retail
Pearl River Mart,3,"When I heard Pearl River Mart was reopening I was excited and happy because I always enjoyed walking through the doors in it's old SoHo location closer to Grand street. I enjoyed the smell of their incense when I used to walk around in that location and the sounds and sight of the waterfall in the stairwell

Some of the positive aspects about the new location is that it's closer to Canal Street train station, it's not on a crowded side of Broadway like the old location, they still carry the same items you would have seen in the old location, there's a gallery located on the 2nd floor and the company/store utilizes social media a lot more. Some of the negative aspects are that it's technically only one floor of merchandise so this location isn't as big as the other location and the staff like the former location aren't as socializing. 

The merchandise and cultural items really do bring a pop and vibrancy into the store, but I feel the atmosphere, flooring, walls, and the restroom need a serious update. I know some people enjoy that old-like interior and decor, but I feel the store would look better if the flooring and walls had an update. 

Overall, I am happy they've decided to reopen and i would definitely bring friends or family from outside of NYC to visit here if they are looking for cultural items that they may not have from where they live. There's really no other store in NYC like Pearl River.",10/4/2017,Retail
Pearl River Mart,5,"I can spend hours and hours at Pearl River Mart, looking and touching all the cute items. First things you see when you step in will be the Chinese clothings, from adults to baby wear. The ladies Qi Pao, brocade jackets are absolutely beautiful, even the men's wear like those kung fu outfits are nice. The Chinese shoes and home slippers look so comfortable, and the bags are cute too. When u proceed further, you will see dining & kitchenware then the beautiful lightings, home decoration and food stuff, all these are found on the ground level. Downstairs they have more kitchenware beddings, pillows, Chinese medication, home accessories, towels, toys, alarm clocks, etc. They just added a third level consisting the Home Department. For those looking for those Chinese Wedding beddings, I saw those red ones with the Dragon & Phoenix embroidery on them on the lower level.

Pearl River Mart,1,"I was here with my 7 year old daughter this past Sat., Feb. 25, 2017.    The store is very small and does not carry a lot of merchandise.  My issue with the store is not with its product assortment but with its employee's treatment of my daughter.  

My child picked up a small toy to look at.   After pickng it up, she put the toy down only to be ***SCOLDED*** by a Pearl River Mart employee for not putting the toy back in its original, ""correct"" location.  

(1) This is a totally absurd reaction by the Pearl River Mart employee  (this is a store and people are allowed to look, touch and freely move merchadise around); and

(2)  My daughter DID NOT place the toy in the wrong location, it was in the worng location to BEGIN WITH.

I will NEVER patronize a store that treats its youngest customers in such a fashion.  Outright RUDE and ridiculous.   Needless to say, my daughter was extremely upset and distraught from her experience at this store.

I picked up a couple items for Christmas presents and a netted bag perfect for the farmers market. I believe their lease expires this December (I hope they relocate), so be sure to stop by before then and support a unique business bridging the gap between two countries.

Pearl River Mart,5,"You must realize, I am at that point of the year where I am missing home so much I'm hallucinating seagulls on the highway here in Kansas. 

Last night, I realized I hadn't given my wonderful cat sitters and friends, Scary M and Kelly N, the gifts i bought them on my last trip to NYC during the holidays. Yes, I'm very thoughtful that way. Forgetting to give gifts to friends who traveled to our home daily in the midst of the Kansas Blizzard of the century. 

Anyway, last night Scary M was at the house and it suddenly dawned on me like the great fire of Mandalay, I HAVE GIFTS FOR YOU!

The gifts were, of course, from Pearl River Mart. A metallic gold Lucky Cat that is *waving*, some Chinese New Year good luck ornaments (woefully late. I hope that bad luck hasn't plagued them in the meantime) and some of that awesome Morningstar Incense (it doesn't have wood in the middle of the sticks, so it's more potent).

Pearl River Mart is *the* place to buy (and receive) gifts. 

Speaking of receiving, here's an incomplete list of the stuff I've been gifting to me me me from PR for over 10 years:

paper parasols (usually for the Mermaid Parade)
Shanghai Girls cigarette ads/calendars (actually anything with Shanghai Girls featured--soap boxes to journals to posters, I'm a bit obsessed)
flip flops
miso soup spoons
Chinese jelly candy
HOT SAUCE 
incense
Lucky Cats in all sizes and positions (seriously!)
Any Dumpling Dynasty art product, shopping bags to journals (google it! you'll die)
lanterns 
bamboo blinds
bird cages
silk/rayon/linen window dressings
fabric
wrapping paper
origami paper
soap
Japanese pottery

Make sure you go upstairs (back of the store staircase if you enter from Broadway) for the gorgeous pricey Chinese furniture that I effing DROOL over, you know, the black and red wood cabinets, benches, tables and the like. Stuff to give me when I've been especially deserving (or can afford to buy *and* ship). Speaking of Chinese furniture, moment of silence for the Chinese cabinet and 200 pound Indian antique wardrobe I left behind in my NY apartment...they are in good hands, don't worry! 

I recall in the old location on Canal Street they had a ton of Kung Fu movies, not sure if the newer location has that.

I have a map of the entire store in my head!

Pearl River Mart,5,"This place is truly a Chinatown/NYC landmark, which is why it's so sad that they're planning on closing this year. But we should be happy instead of sad. I listened to an interview with the owners' daughter and she explained how Pearl River Mart was originally created to provide a place to buy Chinese goods back when trade relations between US and China weren't so great. So if their goal was to have Chinese goods widely available in the States, then they've succeeded!

Anyway, I just had to visit Pearl River Mart one last time. It's three (and a half) stories. First floor is dining ware (plates, cups, sake sets, etc.), food (ramen, sauces, noodles), and other light knick-knacks for around the house. Basement is more serious cookware and kitchenware, along with a gigantic selection of lucky cats and golden piggy banks. Some medicinal stuff too. There's a small half floor for tea between the first and second floors. The second floor is furniture and bigger house decor items (lamps, chests, garden and floral supplies).

The selection they have in this store is amazing, and the space is gigantic (it spans the length of the block). I wish they could be around forever, but their impact will be felt for generations!",24/4/2015,Retail

They have frozen and dry snacks.  I was looking for asparagus biscuits.  I use to buy them in Japan all the time, but I did not see any.   Some of their key chains at Pear River looked exactly like the key chains, I've purchased in the hotel gift store, I use to go to when I traveled to Japan for work.

From Asian clothes to light fixtures to foods to knick knacks--Pearl River has it all. I took my first trip there this weekend and needed to pace myself when looking through everything since it's huge and everything is so adorable. This is the perfect place to peruse or when you need an eclectic gift for someone.

I got a cute set of chopsticks for under $2 (no more grabbing extra sets at the supermarket for me!), picked up some coin purses, chewy candies and ranch flavored toothpicks (random yet essential) but I was amazed with the number and styles of tea sets they offer. I kept going up and down the aisles oohing and ahhing. I wanted to buy everything in this store but don't think there is a suitcase out there that's big enough.

Things can be kitschy and 100% Made in China (both high-end and bargain wares), but if you weed through the tightly packed aisles, you're bound to find items that speak to you. They sell Ming dynasty vases that are a few hundred dollars and ceramic blue and white serving platters that will glam up any tabletop. Potted money trees and bamboo plants for good fortune and prosperity.

This place brings back a lot of childhood memories and I'm so glad to see them thrive especially in the economy we're in now.

Pearl River Mart,5,"This store is enormous in size and is an enormously fun place in which to shop.

I've been stopping in here for years and it remains a favorite SoHo haunt of mine in which to find all kinds of wonderful Asian products.

Although NYC's Chinatown has a number of small stores where you will find many of the same things as you will find here, this is a jumbo emporium of all kinds of goods.  
It's a galaxy of Far Eastern delights. 

You'll find cool clothing, housewares, cooking supplies, fabrics, furniture, spices, statues, wind chimes, paintings, lanterns, stationery, glassware, good luck amulets, and the list goes on.  
It might seem a bit overwhelming at first blush, but really it isn't.  There are multiple levels for your shopping pleasure.

This is by far one of the best places to find a unique gift for anyone for whom you might be shopping and I double dutch dare you not to find something that you simply must have for yourself.  I subscribe to the shopping theory: one for you, at least one for me.

I love that this place is beautifully organized and very clean. Everything has it's place and is neatly shelved or displayed.

On my last visit, I had to use the rest room about which I was nervous....which is my usual state of mind prior to entering any public bathroom particularly in a store this size and in NYC.  I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't have to turn on my heels and run out.  It was usable and clean. 

On this latest  trip, I bought a few small porcelain Chinese bowls that I will use for my mise en place when cooking.  (Notice how I make myself sound like a professional chef by throwing around a phrase like mise en place).

On the visit previous to this, I bought a really pretty black velvet Chinese jacket with burnt-etching in it. I love that jacket.   I didn't find any items I had to have this time but it was probably more to do with the fact that I had less shopping time than I typically allow myself here.  Generally speaking there are any number of attractive and unique clothing items here, again all Asian inspired and often in gorgeous fabrics and prints.  

Allow yourself a lot of time to roam around.   And bring a shopping tote because there is no way you are leaving empty handed.",18/1/2013,Retail

There are a lot of little shops near by that don't have the space or the presentation Pearl River Mart has, but cheaper finds and some harder to find materials that could vary from rugs to calligraphy scrolls, and paintings. 

This place is a glorified spot for all things Asian and is one of the few places that will take a credit card for big purchases.  Its also one of the most organized stores in the area, to which hassling to find a certain item may not be necessary here.  Speaking of hassle, there is no bargaining here.

They do have things that no other stores have. They look authentic and imported from China. Their customer service is a bit on the rude side, but that's what you can expect from a place like that.

Pearl River Mart,5,"As a first generation Asian American, spaces like this mean a lot to me. 

I love PRM because it's got an emporium space of cultural items I grew up with. You can get Chinese calligraphy quills, slippers, cultural garments, snacks, and more. I would note they run more expensive than if you went to a hole in the wall shop in the greater Chinatown area. However, the quality is also nicer. 

Upstairs they have a section that will often showcase artwork from the community. Currently the exhibit running is dedicated to Asian Americans of the southern US. This exhibit features AsAm car mechanics, engineers, grocery store owners, artists, and more. It's an audiovisual narrative that'll tell you a lot about an underrepresented group. For me, a California-raised NYC transplant, these spaces are an important reminder of what else is out there, and the communities I work to represent because they often aren't. 

Prices in general are a bit more expensive but for good reason. Staff is happy to help. I'm so glad this shop exists as one of several opportunities for Chinese immigrant kids like myself to explore and create our own cultural narratives.",10/6/2018,Retail

This current space is about 1/8th the size of the superstore incarnation of Pearl River, but it's packed to the gills with Chinese-themed items from t-shirts to dinnerware. I always get the Mary Jane's  & Kung Fu shoes because they are so comfortable and reasonably priced. The clothing items are on the pricier side and they carry a very limited selection of sizes. The staff in this store is much younger and nicer than the staff at the previous store. As long as this store exists I will always come back again.",18/6/2023,Retail

Pearl River Mart,5,"My history with Pearl River goes back to being a young kid being dragged along on shopping trips to Chinatown by my mother.  Back when Pearl River resided on Canal Street, the store was a gigantic space that had a much more industrial feel than its modern day counterpart.  I remember my mother relying on them for various kitchen appliances and housewares and we rarely left Pearl River empty handed.

Fast forward decades and Pearl River as a store and brand has undergone quite the evolution over time.  Gone are the rice cookers, pots and pans etc. and in are fun T-shirts, beautiful cards and in a bit of a nod to the past, there are still kitchen items including elegant bowls and chopsticks.   Another bit of the ""old"" Pearl River still survives in the form of a fabric section in the back where you can purchase yards of fabric for your projects.  Once upon a time such stores were common in Chinatown, but in the 2020's that is no longer the case.

This new location emerges out of the ashes of the pandemic.  Before COVID hit, Pearl River lost its gigantic multi-level store on Broadway (which was quite a sight to see years ago) and then their smaller store on Walker Street.  I think however that everything worked out for the best as this space suits them much better.  The space is beautifully renovated, wide open with tall ceilings and bright lighting.  The back area has even been converted into a small art gallery focusing on artwork by Asians.

I have a deep affection for the Pearl River brand and it does my heart good to see it continues to survive to this day.  Give them a visit, I think you'll enjoy it!",19/9/2022,Retail

Pearl River Mart,5,"If you grew up in New York City, then you've probably heard of Pearl River Mart.  This store has been around since the early 70s and is an iconic NYC store. As a teen, I remember going on many a shopping trips to Pearl River and finding lots of fun, one of a kind items.  As a college student, Pearl River Mart helped me to decorate my room with inexpensive affordable finds and décor.  And now as an adult, I visit Pearl River Mart whenever I need to find a gift or even whenever I'm in the neighborhood.  The store offers Asian inspired items (fashion, toys, décor and snacks) and is quite eclectic. It's a great place to explore and browse.

Pearl River Mart has moved around a few times and now has locations in Tribeca and Chelsea. The Tribeca location is quite large.   There's an area upstairs that showcases artwork from local artists.  The exhibits here change every so often.  Downstairs, in the basement, are toys, kitchenware and small décor.  The main floor has clothing, dining ware, snacks, decorations, jewelry and plants.

The newer Chelsea location is smaller (1 floor). 

What you'll find inside: Chinese ceramics and tableware, including bowls and chopsticks; some clothing for men, women, kids and babies, slippers.

If it's possible to support ""local"" from far away, and I think it is, then that's what you can do by shopping here online (or in person!). I first heard of them from the comedian Ronnie Chieng mentioning them. I noticed they were giving away their shopping bags with a purchase and I thought that would be a cool souvenir (the spouse has family in NYC), and that led to filling up the shopping cart with other unique items - yes you can find some of it elsewhere but you won't get the same satisfaction.",26/8/2025,Retail

First photo is of a collection of oven mitts they have. I bought another one. The second is of these adorable purses. I bought the own that looks like Chinese take-out.

The only recommendation I have for the owner is this...there was one young boy stocking the shelves of purses. I asked him if the purse had a chain to hold on your shoulder and he said no. I walked on as I didn't want to carry around a clutch but came back and searched inside because the rings on the side told me otherwise. I would just train him a bit on the products in the store as many other people would just walk on without a sale. The young girl at the cash register was super friendly.",9/7/2023,Retail
Pearl River Mart,5,"I love Pearl River Mart - it's part of the Chinatown DNA (though it was never quite ""IN"" Chinatown but around the area..) as I remember visiting their large location on Broadway decades ago, marveling at the 2 stories packed with authentic Chinese & other Asian goodies. I got a Japanese ceramic tea pot set, and several Japanese ceramic bowls/dishes that I still use often to this day, no less than 4 types of tiger balms for my neck & shoulder aches, authentic loose leaf Chinese teas, and even Korean snacks. 

I was worried when their relocated-location below Canal closed down due to the pandemic, and was so elated to hear about their new return to this location... so of course I'd visit! 

I would say the new location is better than the last one - it's longer and sectioned better, and larger with more merchandise. 

Wife and I picked up two ceramic rice bowls and a ginger jar - wife didn't know that was a thing... and she's Chinese. :P I noticed that they now offer way more condiments because I picked up some amazing hot chili oil now that Lao Ganma chili crisp ceased to exist. They even had Malaysian kaya for the kaya toast breakfast I've had in Singapore! 

For those who love Chinese cooking, they had various kitchen tools for the purpose - woks, wok chungs, wok stands, bamboo brushes, etc. They also had still maintained healthy selection of Chinese traditional clothing (men's Chinese-collar shirts, women's qipao (though wouldn't recommend buying here for obvious reasons), and fun T-shirts and other memorabilia up in the front. 

I really loved the backlit sign they put up near the entrance showing the pics of the stores' evolution and its history - read it, it's def. worth your 2 minutes because it is inspiring and if you're Asian (not just Chinese), it makes you proud.

This is one of my all-time favorite stores in NYC. Whether you need some cheap but unique gifts, dishes, tea sets or great lighting for your home...there are few places that can beat the prices or the array of options you'll find here. 

Some of my favorite things I've found:
- stove top burner protectors
- kitchen sink/tub drain strainer 
- chopsticks (duh)
- bamboo cutting boards
- bamboo sponge or small towel dish
- fake flowers
- exotic soaps
- bowls of all shapes and sizes (some as low as $0.65)
- tea pots/tea kettles 
- tea sets
- placemats

Be sure to make your way to the basement for all of the above. The ground floor is mostly stuff that would interest tourists. Check out the second floor as well for great home goods (you'll have to exit and reenter a separate door for this). 

Check back often...they're always getting new things.",23/11/2015,Retail
Pearl River Mart,5,"Just wow. This place was even better than I had expected. My mum and I couldve stayed in here forever. Two floors crammed with just about anything you could imagine of pretty, fun, interesting and more or less useful asian things. Everything from Hello Kitty-lamps to soy sauce.  
A perfect place for finding that unique gift, or just something to add a bit of an asian touch to your style or home. If nothing else its fun just to browse. There is so much to look at - we found it hard leaving as we constantly found things we had missed on our way into the store. 
Still, everything seems tidy, neat and in order. Like everything has its own place.
They play calm music and the sound of running water from the fountain by the staircase is very soothing. 
The men working here are a bit grumpy, but it didnt bother me. Prices are fair, even if the quality of some of their stuff might not be the best. 

I left the store with my bag full of beautifully patterned paper, a cute wallet, panko bread crumbs (its like three times more expensive in Sweden), a paper parasol, chopsticks, a wall ornament with pandas, a bento box and loads more.
Cant wait to come back next time I visit New York.",9/6/2013,Retail
Pearl River Mart,5,"The Pearl River Mart is a treasure trove of miscellaneous charming Asian knickknacks and gizmos a plenty. 

Every time I walk into this place I'm reminded of the scene in The  Little Mermaid when Ariel sings about the whozits and whatzits galore that rests in her cavern of wonders. While that little red head was unsatisfied with her collection of  thingamabobs, I'm convinced that she would never had grown legs if she had her own underwater Pearl River Mart. 
""Sorry Prince Eric, I have a hoard of awesome reasonably priced stuff under the sea, and I don't feel like losing my voice to a guy who needs a crab to convince him to kiss me."" Seriously, reasonably priced stuff before bro-hos.

Honestly, there is an enormous collection of cool-ass things in this store. There are chic clothes, paper lanterns, fat Buddhas,  sexy Buddhas,  paper dragons, you name it they got it! They have the best quality of Chinatown goodies in one  giant store of wonders. Like I mentioned before, their items are very reasonably priced. Their teapots are as gorgeous as the one's they sell in Teavana but like 90% cheaper. I'm not good at math so the numbers may be off, but just get the message that its cheaper than other brand named places.

Go up to the 2nd floor (which over looks the 1st floor) and you can order tea to go or have them make it for you. The 2nd floor is like a little tea shop that I imagine you finding in Hogmeads ( a town in the magical world of Harry Potter, you sad Muggle). It has glass jars of loose teas, herbs, and dried flowers used for tea.

My friend and I decided to take a break from browsing to order french pink rose tea, which has the function of strengthening the liver as well as relaxing the bowels. I believe it only cost $7 to brew us a pot of rose tea, and it was very exciting to be drinking the juice of rosebuds.

Then one day, for no apparent reason, the naked bulbs hanging from the ceiling in every room of my apartment started to really bother me, and I went on a mission for lamp shades/chandelier type items.  Who knew that at most places, these things are works of art and are therefore expensive.  Sigh.

Enter Pearl River Mart.  Have no fear, my apartment has not become ""a la chinoise,"" but my roommate and I found some really fantastic paper chandeliers that look amazing, and we bought three for under $20.  Not to mention 10 pairs of chopsticks for $1.50 and two bags of wasabe peas.  Were I just moving to NYC, I would definitely buy plates and glassware here.  They have some really beautiful stuff for pennies.  And yes, there are lucky cats and dragon kits a-plenty, but the smart New Yorker knows how to get creative without descending into tackiness - and that's why PRM is great.

Everything, really.

Pearl River Mart just serves to confirm further my theory that perhaps I should have been Asian.  Not living in NYC, I've only had the opportunity visit PRM twice; but each time I felt like a kid in a candy store.  PRM is like an Asian version of Urban Outfitters, but fewer clothes and more accessories and housewares.  Everything is either pretty, or cute, or fanciful, or whimsical, or all of it rolled into one: embroidered slippers, silk pajama sets, artfully painted chopstick sets, teapots, recycled-material shopping and lunch bags, rhinestone jewelry, wooden platform flip-flops, grapefruit preservers, glass salt and pepper shakers, Pocky, Botan rice candy, seaweed crackers...

If you are in need of a chong-sam, this is the place to buy one. This place is just filled with all kinds of knicknacks, and probably all ""Made in China."" LOL. They also sell Asian snacks, but the prices are not competitive, you are better off getting those items at your local Asian supermarket.

If you honestly walk into Pearl River Mart expecting a wealth of quality made goods, you may be beyond help. This place caters to the random tourist crowd that is curious enough to venture a little ways off Canal St. It should be obvious, at a single glance, that what you are going to find here is the very picture of what any uninformed Caucasian thinks everyone in China wears as clothing and has about their house.

Pearl River Mart,5,"I've been going to this store since I first came to New York in 2005 and it's insane that it's closing. If I had to summarize what kind of store it is, I'd say it's basically a slightly-more-expensive dollar store with a heavy Asian flare and gorgeous dishware.

Pearl River's rent, currently hovering at just over $100,000 per month, will leap an astounding amount next year, to more than $500,000 per month. How is that possible? I don't know, New York is terrible sometimes? 

Their lease expires later this year in December, so if you find yourself in Soho - you should definitely drop in here and take a look around. I've been getting greeting cards here for ten years, so I'm not really sure where my next go-to card spot will be now.

Fishs Eddy,1,"I grew up in Chelsea visiting the location there on weekends after going to see a movie at the Cineplex next door. I remember when I went away to college and got my first apartment, I excitedly put in an online order. I couldn't afford much so I just bought one or two of some cute trinkets.

I received a phone call from the owner or some higher up who accused me of being a Chinese counterfeiter because of my last name. I'm Korean, first of all, and there's no such Chinese last name that's spelled the way mine is. That's embarrassingly blatant racial profiling, second of all. And the vast majority of items on sale in that store are remnants or cast from stock slipcasting molds, nothing  exceptional enough to be  worth counterfeiting, third of all.

It's been years but I will never forget that phone call. He really doubled down after I spoke to him in perfect English and explained that I wasn't even Chinese.

Fishs Eddy,5,"We had read about Fishs Eddy in a guidebook and then passed by it on a walking tour. On our own time, we went back and perused the wares. Definitely more on the affordable side in comparison to other NYC shops. We came back one more time after deciding on a gift for a friend. When we gave it to her weeks later and mentioned where it was from, she said they love Fishs Eddy.",18/7/2024,Retail
Fishs Eddy,5,"this place is adorable. surprisingly big, insanely cool decorations and little areas to explore, they host cool events here like comedy shows which i recently went to see and they also have great ceramics and knick knacks as you'd expect. love it here.",7/2/2025,Retail
Fishs Eddy,5,"Every so often it's a heck of a treat to make my way to this store. 

I see what they are up to on their Instagram and then I know when they have new stuff.

Today I had to get a prezzie and it had to be a New York themed 
Plate and tea towel. 
I love so much about this store. 
It's clever and filled with charms.

On a sidenote check out the little figurines handmade by the staff and there's also pet portraits available if you need... And I believe you need one!! 
I love this place so much",14/9/2022,Retail
Fishs Eddy,5,"Such a fun store!! I love all the old Syracuse China. You can actually afford to shop here and get lots of unique plates, cups, bowls, etc. They also have artwork and gift type items like candles, puzzles, dish cloths, etc.  The decor and aesthetics of the shop alone make it worth a visit. There's cool artwork and vintage items decorating the walls plus natural light which just make the space so inviting. My mom found a beautiful piece of Syracuse China from a pattern of the set her mom used to have. It was a sample piece so it has the label sticker on the front which makes it even more one-of-a-kind. If you need a gift, love deadstock dishwear, or just exploring a unique shop, you're going to enjoy visiting. I hope to be able to catch the museum tour (it's upstairs from the shop) on my next visit.",10/4/2023,Retail
Fishs Eddy,5,"Passed by this quirkly little place the other day and holy moly, what an interesting store! 

They have an array of eclectic dishes and other kitchen and household items. If you're looking for something different than the standard "" White Corel plates"" this place has you covered. 

Also the ""raise you hand if you're vaccinated,"" display in the front window was awesomely eye catching as well.",4/10/2021,Retail
Fishs Eddy,5,"Super cute kitchenware store that I never knew existed! I was waiting for my lunch date to arrive and with time on my hands, stumbled in because why not. I love serving ware and practically horde the stuff. 

I feel like the designs here tend to be more on the novelty side with illustrations or sassy words, but they do have your classic plain ceramic and porcelain plates as well. I ended up purchasing a small teapot and matching serving plate with it.

Prices are average. The staff are very responsive and were able to answer my questions. 

They also have a pet portrait corner! The artist himself will be doing an event on Mother's day weekend.",30/4/2021,Retail

Fishs Eddy,5,Awesome store with fantastic visual merchandising. Such fun to just browse. Love this place,14/3/2024,Retail
Fishs Eddy,4,"This is a great place to fill space when you have time. There's some quite humorous plates and bowls among other Knickknacks to discover in this establishment that has been in existence for I don't know how many decades.  Back in the day, a friend informed me that they carry various plates from various NYC restaurants across due to having a surplus/discontinuation and that you can purchase them and that's what makes this establishment special to NYC.  You definitely will see lots and lots and lots of plates here. However, you can also find memorabilias --   political ones as well as of New York. There are also some paintings at the back.

If you ever have time to spare you should swing by this place and enjoy.  This is the only location.",1/2/2020,Retail
Fishs Eddy,5,My favorite glassware shop of all time. Four years ago was my first time entering this wonderful store. Fishs Eddy will forever leave a long lasting impression on me. Some of the most unique glassware that's still affordable. Each time I come to NYC mandates a visit to fishs eddy!,18/2/2022,Retail
Fishs Eddy,5,"I grew up just down the block from Fishs Eddy. I can not pass the shop without popping in to see what's new. Over the years I have found stuff to gift absolutely every person I know. My mom hated her middle name, until I found a platter from a restaurant bearing that name, in big glorious script. That platter hung over mom's kitchen door for more than 20 years. Housewarming gifts that are really one of a kind. Yummy girlie antique inspired teapots. Manley coffee mugs and drink ware. Goofy graphic mugs that will make you giggle every morning (Good Morning Asshole mug)!! Of course NYC souvenir items not available anywhere else.
Go. Shop. Bring friends. Point tourists there.",25/7/2023,Retail

This place is really cute. Tons of dishware, cookware, kitchen and home items. Unique selection and pretty fairly priced, too. Would be a great spot to get a gift.

Also, in the back they have an area where they offer pet portraits.",27/9/2021,Retail
Fishs Eddy,5,Really cute shop with lots of fun items. very quirky. Lots of good finds for  unique houseware.,7/1/2024,Retail
Fishs Eddy,5,"I was hooked the first time I walked through their doors.  The merchandise is cute, clever, sturdy and affordable.  Their visual merchandising has always been terrific!  

I purchased glassware back in 2001 that I still own today and it makes me smile when I use it.  I have other little pieces I've picked out from the barrels over the years; little bowls and small dishes, I use around my house for this or that.  They take me right back to the store and how happy Fishs Eddy makes me when I'm in there.  

I always take out-of-town guests into Fishs Eddy and they fall in love with it too.  One friend in Mississippi requests to go in there whenever she's in town.  She loves the pieces she's purchased in the store as well.  

I read the owner's book about how the store got its start.  It was an absolute treat to read!  Plus, the owner's son illustrated the book and they're terrific illustrations.  If you love the store, read her book!",13/2/2020,Retail
Fishs Eddy,5,"So you've probably got to be of a certain age to appreciate and/or enjoy a store filled with dishes and glasses.  But as far as stores filled with dishes and glasses go, there's a reason this place gets almost all 5 star reviews.  I mean, how do you make a store that sells dishes and glasses fun?

They have lots of novelty stuff, New York-themed items, and some political things, too, but there is also non-novelty stuff, and everything appears to be of the highest quality.

Some of the prices, but not all, are on the high side, but again, the goods appear to be very high quality.

For what they sell, this is probably the most interesting store of its type around.  You can buy their products off of their website, too, and have it  shipped to you.

Quirky but a totally fun shop and definitely worth a visit.",31/1/2019,Retail
Fishs Eddy,5,"LOVE this store!

Fishs Eddy is a super unique dish and kitchen accessory shop right off Union Square. Up until recently, I didn't realize this was their only brick and mortar location.

Fishs Eddy does everything from vintage silverware to iconic NYC designs. I love their glass Tupperware designs, highball glasses, dish cloths, platters, and their kitschy (in the best way) extras.

If you're looking for a gift, some NY keepsakes, kitchen accessories, or a great way to spend 30min - you must take some time to walk through Fishs Eddy!",1/11/2020,Retail
Fishs Eddy,3,"This is my kind of novelty store. I had a good time browsing the place during my short visit. I can't help myself to smile for  all the things I saw in every corner.  Reasonably and fairly priced. A recommended place to get gifts for anyone which by the way a bit if everything to anyone. If not we were scheduled to see a movie across the street, I may stayed longer. 

I'll be back.",26/12/2018,Retail
Fishs Eddy,5,"I've been a customer of Fishs Eddy for 20+ years.  It's my ""pick me up"" store - meaning every time I enter, it always makes me smile.  I don't think I've ever left empty handed.  Whether on the hunt for something specific or stumbling upon something that screams ""must have,"" Fishs Eddy never disappoints!  My first cake stand came from this special place, and it is still beloved.  I was lucky enough to chat with the owner, Julie yesterday, and so glad we did.  She is the real deal, and absolutely lovely!

Fishs Eddy,5,"Best little shop with a variety of unique, sketchy and some customizable cutlery, servingware, kitchen accessories and glassware! I particularly like shopping here for friends who are picky or for fun gifts for a bachelorette party. 

Prices range from low to high depending on what you are looking for.   They take major credit cards and cash. The staff here is amazing because they're very NYC (read snarky and funny as ever) but in a helpful way. 

Don't break anything because it will be on your dime--there's a whole theme.They recently re-opened after closing due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  But if their new hours don't suit you, they have a pretty functional website that can save you in a pinch.

It's worth checking out if you like hosting at home or want to find a statement maker for your table arrangement.",19/8/2020,Retail

Fishs Eddy,5,"I love this store. Very kitschy and hip.  From the plain and simple to the wild n whacky; this store has a little bit of something for everyone.  My absolute fave is the section in the back with a giant sign that reads Oh My Gawd! Dishes that boast suggah, creamah & cawfee... 
interesting kitchen gadgets that you've never seen before or thought you needed but you'll find them here. 
Friendly, attentive and knowledgeable staff are there to help. Prices are a little high but heck... it is Manhattan after all- they have to make their rent!",18/6/2018,Retail
Fishs Eddy,4,"Loved the store; Has an old country store feeling to it in the middle of NYC.
One of a kind designs of mugs, dish towels, gadgets.
Prices are reasonable for mementos.

I particularly liked the City themed dish towels with the Brooklyn Bridge, Manhattan Bridge. Etc.
The cat and dog themed mugs, dishes, towels are neat.
Kids have a corner too.

I found the perfect themed glassware for friends of mine.

They also had a political area, with dolls, kitsch,. Very funny.",17/9/2018,Retail

Fishs Eddy,5,"Love this store! 

If you need to throw a party and want a funky platter to put your cheese & meats on, you've come to the right place. They had the coolest tray shapes like a Memo pad and smaller plates as report cards. (I didn't buy them) 

Dishes, glasses, flatware, bowls, mugs, cooking utensils, are you seeing where I'm going with this?? They have it all at Fishs Eddy

Now, little do they know.. I'm also the Yelp Duke of Williams-Sonoma out east. I'm always spying with my little eye prices on glasses and kitchen items. I kinda know how much bargains cost. I'm not going to be swayed by their novelty items.

I did find two funky service bowls as well as a small bottle that looks like a Milk Bottle. When I have company over, I'll pour the Milk in the bottle and my guests will say:

Ooooh How interesting! Milk in a Milk Bottle.. 
(They don't know I got it on clearance)

Fishs Eddy, you got me on the hook!

Fishs Eddy,5,"I was looking for some NY souvenirs so I googled and this store came up.  I looked their website beforehand to see what they had and really liked what I saw, so I decided to actually hit the store.

I actually had a hard time not to buy so many things from here.  I probably spent an hour in their small store.  I bought two mugs as christmas gifts and two pasta bowls for myself.  

Their designs are cute, funny and unique.  My friends seemed to like the gifts and I really love my pasta bowls.  The only negative side is the heaviness of their items.",17/2/2019,Retail
Fishs Eddy,5,"What a fun store!  My friend brought us in when we were visiting NYC last weekend saying it was one of her favorite places and now I know why.  There are all kinds of cute dishes, mugs, and towels with New York themes and funny artwork, some of it irreverant and some of it inspiring.  I spent a lot of time just browsing everything and figuring out how much I wanted this or that. Come here for excellent gift ideas, too. Service was super friendly and this will definitely be a regular stop for me when I'm in the city, as well.",9/12/2018,Retail
Fishs Eddy,5,"I absolutely love home goods stores (I probably love them too much for my own good haha) but I just love browsing and looking at the new things I can buy to add to my kitchen/home. 

I can't believe I didn't know about this store despite walking past this area multiple times. I guess the name or store front doesn't really suggest that it's a home good store so I never gave it much thought. 

The staff are wonderful and the store interior is very nicely laid out. Everything is beyond cute and they have punny things too. I love the little shot glasses that say ""ttyl"" on a gravestone on it. 

It does get a little risky carrying a big bag which can knock things off the shelves.",15/11/2017,Retail

They had a great sign on the outside of the shop and not sure how long it had been there but it certainly was perfect for post election blues.",14/11/2016,Retail

Fishs Eddy,5,"TL;DR - Witty, political (left leaning) and full of gorgeous things for your home.

We came here on a recent NYC trip after reading about it when trying to find some unusual homewares. We weren't disappointed! The week we were there, the shop window was a recreation of the Trump Baby balloon which flew over London during his recent visit to the UK. We're no fans of Trump, so found this hilarious. The display changes though... by the time we left the city it was being changed to a mural of birds instead.

In side has a whole host of products, laid out by artist do you'll see a selection of bowls, cups, mugs, plates with one style of art on them all grouped together. The products are great quality - really nice big mugs were my favourites - and whilst they're not cheap, they're not too pricey either. If you don't like the price, they had a pretty extensive sale section too where mugs could be had for as little as $4 (albeit without a design on them).

We had to consider transport back to the UK so couldn't buy everything we would have liked but came back with a fabulous bridges of new York tea towel and two bars of ""Trump Tiny Hand Soap"".",27/7/2018,Retail

Fishs Eddy,4,"If you love home decor this is your place.  There is a slight slant toward the female based customers with heavy emphasis on female empowerment books and materials, housewares, holiday decor and cooking.  That isn't to say, a male won't enjoy his experience, but most likely, it takes a space type of male.

Located in the heart of the Flatiron district, it does great foot traffic.

Prices are high, but you are getting quality items.

They are well staffed with 3 cashiers waiting to assist you.
Be careful, as there is a lot of fragile items with not a lot of square footage in the store.  It does go back deep, but it is a bit of a narrow maze.

You will find amazing items including plates, glassware, ornaments, cooking utensils, gifts and housewares.  

It is like IKEA but high octane and mostly unique items you won't find in other places.",23/12/2017,Retail
Fishs Eddy,5,"This is my all time favorite store in NYC! I make sure to visit every time I am in the area.

Fishs Eddy,5,"I first came across Fishs Eddy products at West Elm a while back when I began to realize that every cute item that really was unique carried their brand. I never realized this was a store and so when I saw this while in NY I was estatic and the shop did not disappoint. Basically, I had the best time shopping around and exclaiming over everything that was either hilarious, witty, adorable, or all of the above. Genuinely had a hard time narrowing down my purchases since well, as it states in their motto, their stuff ain't light. I seriously love this store, and if you can't find something you like, then you're probably a humorless soul. I'd assume Fishs Eddy probably has a plate or mug attesting to that fact.",14/2/2018,Retail
Fishs Eddy,5,"Here's a shop where every visit is an adventure. You  may be looking for something here - and you'll find three things that you didn't even know you needed!

Fishs Eddy,4,"At first I thought this was a restaurant when I walked past it. It is a housewares shop that sells used or liquidated housewares and utensils, as well as paintings by local artist.

Decor feels like a country store in Vermont with lots of incandescent lights and string lights. There is so much china and stoneware here, if you're looking they'll have it.

This stuff is used, clearance or liquidated stuff but in new condition. Prices I personally feel are high e.g. small plate/bowl ~$7 in used and dirty collection in back.

The vibes were great with music being piped in from the 70's and 80's e.g. Eagles, Bob Marley, etc instead of the standard loud house music you hear in most retail shops these days.

It's worth a look just to set your mood and experience a different kind of store in NYC even if you don't wind up picking up anything.

Enjoy the experience!

The music is upbeat, the lights and colors are all bright and popping, the staff is friendly and engaging, and all of the merchandise is kitschy or funny or whimsical. 

A lot of things are between $12-$14. It's a perfect place to search for a gift for someone. They have a whole table dedicated to Jewish stuff that was just hilarious (Mazel Tov!). They also have a random pile of nude paintings in a corner (the best ones are towards the front).",25/7/2017,Retail

Fish Eddy's has a ton of really fun and cute plates, cups, bowls, and things like that. They have all different fun prints and collections from New York designs to Cat Lovers to Dog Lovers, they are really creative and they add new ones occasionally too. They also have products you may want to stock your kitchen with, like staple wine glasses, mason jars, utensils, etc.

They have political stuff, cat stuff (!!!!), and vintage/classic stuff. I say ""stuff"" because I don't know what word to use to cover dish cloths, books, mugs, and candles. Everything is reasonably priced (though do small cake stands really cost $60? I'm not sure about that ...) and sooo incredibly tempting. On my last trip, I walked away with a bunch of their small bowls in various colors (only $3.99 each), a crème brûlée ramekin, a tiny cupcake stand (for my macarons!), a tiny whisk, and a tiny spoon. :D Excited to come back :)",18/10/2018,Retail

Fishs Eddy,4,"Yes I'm a big fan of Fish's Eddy.  Why you may ask?  Let me list the reasons...

If you happen upon the store off of Union Square, you'll find a kitchen store with a New York flare.  Stylish glasses, mugs & dishes, are just the beginning.  

I stumbled on them some years ago on a lark, and bought a few Christmas gifts from here.  Boy were they a hit!  It was like I could do no wrong.  God had sent a gift giving angel to watch over me, and make sure I won the hearts & minds of all my upstate family peoples!  

Now these are some of the reasons but not all of them.  In the last couple of years, I've taken to do more online shopping.  Because you know it's tough to carry bags & bags of gifts when you're traveling far & wide for the holidays.  FE has a great online store, which is as easy to navigate as the brick & mortar.  Plus there are pages with ideas & price sorting.  All the stuff you need to make your gift shopping a snap.  I've also found that typically if I order just after thanksgiving, I stumble unbeknownst to me, upon some free shipping deal or other.  And hey who doesn't like that?

Seriously, if you have homemakers & cooks, kitchen or cat lovers on your list, this is the place to do your holiday shopping!",9/12/2017,Retail

Also, I always find something I like or something I want to gift to someone and I will make the space in my luggage!

I love their New York collections, especially the Skyline and Bridge & Tunnel. These make the perfect gifts to bring back home since they're exclusively New York! 

Service is great and they pack everything very well for transport. FYI, if you are visiting and don't have the desire to lug your purchases back home, they have most of their products available on their website.",23/8/2015,Retail

Fishs Eddy,5,"This rad store on the corner of Broadway and 19th has been by go-to for gifts for many a year. Fishs Eddy serves up the best housewarming, hostess, Christmas, birthday, etc. presents; anything I've bequeathed to another has been quite warmly received.

New patterns are regularly introduced but the popular ones stick around. A lot of them are New York-related but there are a fair amount of non-NYC designs. Hopefully Fishs Eddy will add some Queens-themed designs soon! My all-time favorites are the dogs and the cats. As recommended by an employee, regardless of your pet preference (cats rock!), you really need to buy both patterns to get the joke. 

The items are a bit expensive but I'm okay with that since the goods are just so neato. Plus the employees are actually nice and smile.

I recently purchased a ""Sawlt & Peppa"" shakers for my home, when I got back I discovered the peppa shaker plug didn't fit. I emailed and spoke with Noah who made a few suggestions to see if it would be fixable (didn't work) so without asking he shipped a new set to me.",8/12/2018,Retail
Fishs Eddy,5,"I'm addicted to mugs. 
I seriously am. Mismatched collection. 
Big ones, small ones. Stripes, polka dots, pure white, off-white, orange, blue, handle or without- well, you get the picture. I'm admittedly obsessed. 

I can't be in Union Square without feeling the impulsive urge of stopping at Fishs Eddy and indulging in housewares or MORE mugs that I probably (actually, DEFINITELY) don't need. Although I'm usually confused about how to pronounce it (Fish and Eddy? IS THE ""S"" SILENT?!) As I enter the store I'm overwhelmed (in a good way) and consumed by nostalgia that takes me back to a childhood in the country side I've never even had. Yes- the houseware at Fishs Eddy is so beautifully retro yet modern I feel obliged to conjure up some false memories of a life in the country, of milk delivered by a milkman in glass bottles when really, let's be real, I grew up in this concrete jungle where we buy milk at the corner bodega that unfortunately comes in a ugly plastic jug. Yeah, a girl can dream though. They have it all here- anything you might need, the sky's the limit- or consult your credit limit. Things get pretty pricey up in here! Worth it if you ask me. 

So besides my obsession with mugs, why do I love Fishs Eddy so much? Well, when I enter Fishs Eddy, I submerge myself in an alternative world where I grew up in the country, ate farm fresh eggs everyday, the milkman came every morning without fail and my mother taught me how to make the PERFECT apple pie. 

Fishs Eddy is obviously my escape from reality. Fortunately my escape usually comes in the form of a $.99 coffee cup found in a bin at the back of the store.",14/11/2011,Retail
Fishs Eddy,5,"About 10 years ago, I was an unpaid entertainment intern living in Union Square and I would dream about the day when I could shop at Fishs Eddy. That day arrived recently and my shopping experience was just as wonderful as I hoped it would be. 

All of their products are whimsical, unique and actually affordably priced. 
I purchased the cutest cheese platter (~$18) that looks like a lined sheet of school paper. It's ceramic and can be written on with Sharpie, then easily washed away. They carefully packaged it up and it returned with me in one piece to Los Angeles.

Randazzo's Clam Bar,2,"Heard so many good things about this old school seafood place and finally went on a day when we visited the aquarium. Should have come to yelp to read the reviews before going, because... 

... Bad decision. Everything was mediocre at best. 

We got the fried and steamed combo with scungilli, mussels, shrimp and calamari. When the dish arrived, our jaws dropped. The plate was so tiny for $31, and the steamed seafood was totally tasteless. To add insult to injury, they put bread under the calamari to make the already tiny dish look bigger. Who does that? 

The portion of the pasta marechiara was big, but that's about it. The ""sauce"" was not what I call a sauce, it's super watery and didn't taste of anything much despite the amount of garlic they put in it. The chopped seafood was the same - tasteless.

Overall: 6

Been here a few times and really wanted to like the place due to its history. unfortunately, it does not live up to the hype and felt like a run of the mill seafood joint. For this review, I will simply focus on the meal I had this past weekend, which was a similar feeling I had experienced in previous visits.

First of all, we walked in hoping to get some fried soft shell crabs while they are in season, which were prominently displayed on their specials menu. Sadly they sold out of them the day prior. Then we asked for steamers, but they didn't have that either. We were quite disappointed. Regardless, we march on since there is a bevy of seafood to choose from. Here is a list of what we had.

Top Neck Clams (9/10) - Maybe some of the best clams I have ever had. Fresh, plump, clean, sweet, and utterly delicious. So good in fact, we got a second order.

Little Neck Clams (6/10) - These weren't bad, but definitely not as plump or sweet as the Top Neck Clams. Clearly a briny taste, and had sand in few of them.

Blue Point Oysters (6/10) - Never been a fan of Blue Point Oysters, probably because they are so bland. Honestly, these were well shucked and extremely clean, good meaty size and fresh for sure, but flavorless as expected.

Spicy Crab Corn Chowder (3/10) - Literally no crab flavor at all, just a thick, creamy, and spicy corn chowder that I can easily make better at home. One of the saddest dishes.

Fried Scallop Sandwich (6/10) - The scallops were over-fried a bit and not as juicy or tender as they should be. The batter was also a tad thick. With that said, it was decent without the bread, which was just a toasted hamburger bun.

Shrimp Randazzo (4/10) - Looks can be deceiving. Everyone else was ordering it, so we did too. Unfortunately, the watery sauce had barely any flavor. Pasta is simply from a box. The shrimps were fine, mussels were okay, but the clams were grossly overcooked.

Our server was very sweet and friendly, though sometimes it was hard to get her attention when she was on her phone. The space is old school clam bar, but prices were not cheap. I would absolutely swing back for some of those unbelievably great Top Neck Clams, but unlikely to stay for a full meal in the future.",29/4/2024,Food & Beverage

Randazzo's Clam Bar,1,"We read the reviews and most were glowing, but we had a different experience here. 
For starters, we asked to move to a different table because we were seated in front  of the door, which when opened,  the wind caused everything on our table to fly off. We were at a table for 4. Across was a table for 6, two of the seats could have easily been moved to our table, but we were told no we couldn't sit there. 
Ok, on to the food. Sub par at best, but at fancy restaurant prices. The baked clams- frozen and all bread crumbs. The oysters were not Blue Point- they were huge and tough. The Little necks were also tough. The Lobster roll-dry and chopped like tuna fish with lots of celery and no flavor- barely any lobster either. 
Muscles served in tomatoey water which they also served the pasta in. The Calamari was so- so. 
Our waitress was fine, but she asked two different girls to bag up our baby's leftovers more than twice and they both ignored her and did something else while we waited more than 10 minutes for the check. I ended up bagging our stuff myself. Lots of people standing around chatting and gossiping and no one giving a crap about the customer. Never again.",6/7/2025,Food & Beverage

Randazzo's Clam Bar,3,"Get the fried calamari. It really is the star here. It's served with your choice of ""medium sauce"" or ""hot sauce"" (or both), but that's kind of a misnomer. The ""hot sauce"" is barely spicy and has more of a mild smoky and peppery flavor. The medium sauce is just a sweeter version of marinara sauce. 

I was a little let down by the pasta dishes. We ordered the shrimp fra diavolo with linguine and rigatoni vodka. The pasta itself was cooked well in both dishes. The fra diavolo sauce was fantastic (perfect combo of tangy, sweet and a hint of spicy) but unfortunately the seafood was subpar. I was also not a fan of the vodka sauce - it's much creamier and cheesier than any vodka sauce I've had and, while this might be a matter of personal preference, it was not for me.

Overall, surprised this made this year's NYTimes top 100 list.",18/8/2024,Food & Beverage

- Spicy Crab Corn Chowder: had a perfect blend of heat and sweetness which was packed with sweet corn and generous chunks of crab",25/7/2024,Food & Beverage
Randazzo's Clam Bar,5,"You know the old saying you can't go home again, well I have been out of Brooklyn for close to 30 years. My taste buds were craving some real good calamari with hot sauce. There are some local places  good but not up to the standard set by Randazzo's. The last time I had a hot sauce it was like someone took a jar of Tabasco and microwaved it and called it ""hot sauce"" nah doesn't work. Also the breading overwhelms the delicate nature of the calamari Back to Brooklyn I go. Find a parking space on the same block! That was a miracle. You walk in and its like coming home again. It almost seemed as though the same waitstaff was there! The place is always busy but the people there never forget to be polite and above all welcoming. Once seated the waitress got us menus which definitely were not needed. We placed our order and while we were waiting we were informed of some specials which sounded very yummy but my mission was to dive into a big order of calamari  with the hot sauce on the side. The whole place just had that air of familiarity and warmth. Now if I can only convince them to open a place close to me all would be perfect but there is nothing like the original and only! The food was great the service was in my opinion great as well and my craving for some real good hot sauce, yeah it was worth the trip.

Randazzo's Clam Bar,3,"Went for dinner with friends for the first time after hearing so much about this place. Decent menu with enough items to choose from. Food was just OK. I have to be honest. I was definitely a little underwhelmed. I expected a little more. The fried calamari were good as were the clams on the half shelf. My friend really enjoyed her muscles. My zuppa di the clams was good though for an entrée the portion size was not good for the price they charge. There should've been a lot more clams.

Randazzo's Clam Bar,4,"Randazzo's is a South Brooklyn institution in it's own right! Located right opposite to the piers on Emmons Ave, this no frills family restaurant has been a cult favorite forever. 

When you first walk into the restaurant, it is bright and airy, seating is utilitarian and spread apart. It's quite spacious inside, which is nice because it doesn't feel cramped. This restaurant is more on the casual end. 

My friend and I came here after a long day at the beach and Randazzo's was exactly the vibe we were looking for. Our server was sweet and thorough. We started our meal with half a dozen fresh oysters. These were delicious and tastes like the ocean - so good! 

I ordered grilled octopus for a starter. This item is not on the menu, but I wanted to try it as I had seen yelp photos of it beforehand. The octopus was delicious, perfectly tender. I wish that it was a little bit more charred on the outside, though and have a little bit more seasoning. 

For entrées, my friend and I ordered crabcakes sandwich and lobster roll. The crabcakes were delicious, full of crab meat, and not a lot of bread crumbs which I liked. The coleslaw here is mild and creamy, and served as a perfect contrast to the crab cake patty. Lobster roll was good, came on a burger bun. The meat taste of fresh, and the dressing was pretty good with celery and mayonnaise. I do wish we got a little bit more lobster or the meat was chunkier. The zucchini fries that came on the side were banging. If you were dining here, don't forget to order those as they are really really good and super fresh and perfectly fried. 

Overall, I think this place is a solid gem. I would definitely come back here for another seafood centric meal, and it's location by the boats and piers cannot be beat.!",14/8/2023,Food & Beverage

Randazzo's Clam Bar,3,"Randazzo's is not too special, except that it is right on the marina in Sheepshead Bay and has been around long enough to develop a reputation as one of the mainstays in an ever changing strip of Emmons Ave restaurants.

It is essentially Lenny's Clam Bar in Brooklyn, an Italian-seafood joint with plentiful portions and big appetites to feed. The differences are stark, but I am not here to compare the two, this is not Lenny's. 

One of the prides of this restaurant is the Pasta Marechiara, a blend of linguini pasta (the right choice of pasta), in a light sauce with finely chopped shrimp, clams, and calamari. It is tasty and there is enough seafood in the dish to make you wonder if there is any left in the ocean. I will never complain about that.

What I will complain about is everything else. The borderline rude staff (to be fair, today is Mother's Day, so I will try to give them the benefit of the doubt), and the bland tasting options I ate in addition to the above. I had a lobster bisque soup with barely any lobster and found it lacking in any other substance. The fried calamari appetizer had zero taste. In fact, the hot tomato sauce that came with it ruins it because it is too hot.

I understand this is not Maine, other parts of New England, or any seafood town along the Chesapeake Bay, but this seemed rather rushed and thrown in front of me than a sense of love and appreciation for our nautical neighbors.",14/5/2023,Food & Beverage
Randazzo's Clam Bar,4,"If you're looking for a fancy seafood restaurant with expensive silverware, eat somewhere else. If you just need delicious, fresh seafood (the fishing boats are sitting in Sheepshead Bay across the street) with relaxing ambience, this is the place. Doubt it has changed a bit in 50 years. If you sit at the counter, they shuck your oysters in front of you. The New England Clam Chowder is delicious. The service is quick and friendly. Nice place.",31/8/2024,Food & Beverage
Randazzo's Clam Bar,3,"I've been told my whole life that Randazzo's is an institution. My friends that were born and raised in Sheepshead, or Marine Park, or even you know, the good parts of Brooklyn,* they love it. And they'll always love it. 

And I get it. There's a lot to be said for fried seafood and cold beer after a day out at Coney Island. Especially when it's served by a fun and personable staff that lit up when they saw my kids, and gave them lollipops (a nice gesture even if you don't want your kids eating candy before dinner). 

If I grew up coming here, I'm sure I'd also have the same sentimentality. 

And I do like this place for certain things. Fried shrimp. Fries. Beer. That's what I'll stick to next time around.

Unfortunately, I wanted some baked clams, and with Clam Bar right there in the name, I have to say I was pretty disappointed in these. Small, tasteless, dry. I didn't even want to finish what we ordered, and I never leave food on the plate. I'm also surprised that a place like this is handing out packets of tartar sauce instead of making it in house. This isn't McDonald's. 

It may be an institution, but I don't think it's the same as it was, or it wouldn't have made it.

Service was ""meh,"" at best. Not the politest and available staff we're used to. Be sure to bring cash, as it's ""cash only."" They have an ATM, but it broke down, and we were told we'd have to wait for a repairman to arrive to fix the machine.

Randazzo's Clam Bar,1,"Let me start by saying I've been going to Randazzo's with my family for close to 50 yrs. This used to be a common place for me to hit all summer through my teens, 20's, and 30's. The food here used to be be phenomenal... World Class.

Left Brooklyn, got married, so obviously I stopped going as often as I used too, but every time I come home we usually go out for Randazzo's . 

The days of perfectly baked clams and fried calamari are gone -
AND THEY AIN'T EVER COMING BACK. 
The Talent in the kitchen has been replaced with god knows who, and the food has been going consistently downhill for around 3 years now.

We ordered Calamari and 2 Dozen baked clams to start, and neither one came out right.
The Calamari had that rubber consistency, which is the same problem I had the LAST time we were in, but the worst offense was the Baked Clams. 
They looked normal when they came out, but underneath the bread crumbs
the clams that were ""supposed"" to be baked, were wet, slimy, and lukewarm.
Yep, these were one click above raw.

The waitress ( who is very nice, and I don't blame her ) knows us, and knew something was wrong when we left 22 of them ( the other 2 had to be spit into napkins... disgusting ) .
She asked the problem and I honestly didn't want to tell her. 
I didn't want to piss anyone off in the kitchen since we had already ordered our entrees and still had ALOT of food coming....
 She said please, let me send it back and they'll make it right.

As a rule of thumb - I DO NOT DO THIS.
She pretty much insisted and assured us that it would be fine, she always remembers us ( she should, she's a great server and we ALWAYS take very Good care of her ), and she wants to take care of this because she knows they're our favorite, etc.etc.  We let her take it back.

Now they come back out at the same time as our entrees. Whatever.
I try one of the baked clams and AGAIN - SAME F**kin THING. 
 
Onto dinner. My linguini was undercooked. 
This guy's got a f**kin problem back there.....
There were 4 of us. 
2 of us said their food tasted "" OK"" ,
Myself and my cousins entrees were downright bad.

Without prompting, the waitress apologized and deducted the baked clams from the bill.
It really didn't matter at that point, I think she could tell. 
Listen, we took really good care of her and said Thanks for Everything and we meant it. This isn't her fault. 
We left.

When we got in the car we had a family discussion about our past few visits   and we all came to the same Sad Conclusion ..... 
The food is either mediocre on a good day now, to inedible on a bad day.
It's basically become an overpriced tourist trap that's living off it's old reputation and location.
We're never going back.

Randazzo's Clam Bar,4,"This is a great place to have fresh seafood in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. A casual and relaxed restaurant which you can chill with your buddies, families and friends.

Randazzo's Clam Bar,4,"I was here with a bunch of others in April last year. I know it was a while ago as it was prior to my allergy being severe (as I definitely wouldn't order the oysters/calamari now and probably avoid the conch.) This is an old school place and it was crowded. The service if I recall correctly was fine.

We ordered the following dishes:

Spicy crab/corn chowder
Lobster bisque
Spaghetti with shrimp/lobster sauce
Fried zucchini
Mixed fried seafood platter (filet, shrimp, scallop, oyster)
Mixed seafood appetizer with French fries (scungilli [conch,] mussels, shrimp, calamari)
Fried flounder with baked potato
Lobster rolls with baked potato (and more fried zucchini)

I remember the chowder being excellent. The bisque was good. The spaghetti had good texture but we'd probably just get the fra diavlo sauce instead of the shrimp/lobster. The fried zucchini was good. The mixed seafood/fried seafood was also fine. The fried flounder was easily the weakest thing but  I'd describe this place more for shellfish rather than fish fish. Special note to the particularly good lobster roll. Sure it was pricey but it was the biggest one I have found.  Just odd that it's served on a brioche which made it a bit bready compared to the usual. Still very tasty.

And yes their spicy sauce goes perfect with the seafood. There's a reason why it's famous.",9/3/2022,Food & Beverage
Randazzo's Clam Bar,4,"It really is all about the sauce here. More specifically, all about the red sauce. Doesn't matter what you order as long as it comes drenched in red sauce or get the red sauce on the side, and undoubtedly you will walk away with a happy belly. The sauce is deep, bold, and delicious!!! All of the dishes are pretty standard, and what you'd find on most Italian menus. But somehow when the red sauce hits it, it turns from standard to outstanding. I loved the food, the causal ambiance, unpretentious atmosphere, and the sauce.",30/3/2023,Food & Beverage
Randazzo's Clam Bar,4,"Laid back, comfortable atmosphere. Fancy it's not. All they offer is fresh seafood and good service. Which has been enough for me for over 50 years. They know how to serve your oysters: with horse radish and Tabasco. They know how to serve clam chowder: hot and thick with crackers. You can never leave hungry.",31/8/2024,Food & Beverage
Randazzo's Clam Bar,3,"This was a spot my partner frequented years ago with his family and he said it looked the same. The layout consists of a few tables and chairs filling the room. Please note they did not check vaccination cards or require masks. There was also no wait on a weekend.

We had a waitress approach us very quickly. She was on a mission through every encounter to ensure there was no dilly daggling. It was nice, but also felt rushed and staff throughout the restaurant would just yell at each other. Quite noisy. 

We had the calamari, lobster bisque, the spicy crab corn chowder, cherry stones and beer. The best was the crab corn chowder. The cherry stones lacked flavor even with the sauce and the calamari was just good. 
I longed for more but was not impressed with what I already had to dare get more.

Randazzo's Clam Bar,4,"After watching the hotdog eating contest at Coney Island, we came here for late lunch. Don't worry, we watched the contestants from far away. This is a classic old-time Italian place where everybody knows the restaurant's name. Thank God no one knows everybody's name. Cheers to that!

We had a waitress named Grace. She was all right. We decided to go to steamers, baked clams, and a seafood combo. Everything was perfect. The seafood was fried seafood covered with tomato sauce. Steamers were excellent, juicy, and sweet. After all that, we tried to take some seafood pasta with tomato sauce to go, but the waitress said they couldn't make it that way because they have a different sauce they put on top of the pasta. This is a sauce they pour on top, not cook with it. So we passed on that takeout.

Try this once in your lifetime, and you're all set!",25/7/2021,Food & Beverage

Randazzo's Clam Bar,4,"A Brooklyn institution which I am grateful to have tried! Located right by the water, I can picture a Saturday morning stroll ending with some fresh seafood here. The interior of this place clearly hasn't changed over the years, in the best way. Old school menu, countertop bar seating, and even all the signs were a reflection of the institution that it is. The clams here were very fresh and I slurped them up in no time!",2/8/2023,Food & Beverage
Randazzo's Clam Bar,1,"Randazzo's Clam Bar, like the New York Yankees, shows how far a once mighty institution can fall. Bourdain visited this place and Pete Wells still has it on his 100 best restaurants in NYC. If this makes the cut, there may only be 99 edible restaurants in New York. The only good thing about Randazzo's is that when the owners arrived around 7 pm, they were very friendly. 

Like everyone else, we wanted to love Randazzos.

My wife and I got to Randazzo's at 5:50 on Friday evening. We were very excited and were sat immediately. We did not get any water until 6:23. The entire restaurant was full of other hungry tables patiently waiting on their food. Everyone seemed to be waiting an extremely long time for their food. No servers checked in on an us and the place was very well staffed. For a menu of fried food, I am not exactly sure what the extreme delay was. Randazzo's needs a serious management overhaul. 

The calamari arrived and it tasted like standard calamari with a decent hot sauce. Shockingly, the calamari was completely ungarnished. No lemon. No banana pepper. Nary a piece of parsley. 

I had the steamed lobster with a side of fried zucchini. The fried zucchini was pretty good and the steamed lobster was satisfactory. My wife's Lobster Randazzo arrived five minutes prior and my steamed lobster was lukewarm. I imagine it was left sitting for a while.

The pricing added insult to injury: one calamari appetizer, a Lobster Randazzo, and a Steam Lobster came to $140 before tax and tip.

If nothing else Randazzo's is certainly consistent. This was my second trip there and it was just as bad as the first.",29/6/2024,Food & Beverage
Randazzo's Clam Bar,3,"It's one of those local places you come to for a decent meal, not amazing not bad. I was feeling seafood and my friend was treating so had to find a decently affordable place with a ton of options. My friend eats a lot so it needed to be worth his money too. 

The guy at the counter recommended the shrimp fra divola. We ordered the littleneck clams, shrimp fra divola pasta (came with actual clams and shrimp) and a clam linguine (just chopped up clams) pasta. The little necks were good, but 6 for $10 is sorta pricey, but oh well I wanted clams. The pasta dishes took a bit to come but not a ridiculously long time. We also asked for additional plates since we were sharing. I think the shrimp fra divola dish was better than the clam linguine, but my friend preferred the clam linguine. I preferred the shrimp pasta because it was a tad spicy and had more flavor, but my friend thinks the sauce was too salty and overpowered the dish, so he preferred the clam linguine. The clam linguine was a bit plain for me, but not bad. 

Service at the counter was also pretty good. My friend remarked that he enjoyed his time here (unprompted) so yeah I guess overall would recommend it for a casual catch up with a friend and dinner with family.",23/8/2021,Food & Beverage
Randazzo's Clam Bar,2,"I hate to give a bad review, especially to such a neighborhood staple, but the food just is so off lately.

My order had mussels in white sauce, calamari, and a lobster bisque. 

The mussels had no flavor and the broth they were in tasted like an oily oregano water and literally nothing else. I had to sprinkle salt on each one I ate. 

The calamari was nice and crispy and not over cooked at all which is great but the breading AND the marinara had absolutely no seasoning at all and once again had to add the salt myself. The waitress also never brought the lemon for the dish even though she kept saying she would.

The lobster bisque had literally no lobster in it at all and tasted like bland heavy cream and boiled potatoes. Again, had to add a good amount of salt and pepper to make it bearable. 

Our waitress was very sweet and I really enjoyed her but waited a long time just for her to bring a soda. Also, at $3 a soda you'd think you'd get a regular can but it's a mini bottle instead so they're definitely price gouging there a bit. 

Overall the takeaway was that the literally do not season any of their food so be prepared to salt and pepper to everything.",9/7/2022,Food & Beverage
Randazzo's Clam Bar,2,"This review makes me sad. I wanted to try the place because it's such a neighborhood institution and I heard about it from people who grew up there, but maybe things have changed since they were last there. 
The service was friendly and prompt, but the food was so bad. I ordered a seafood combo and none of the seafood had any salt at all. 
It seemed fresh enough and wasn't overcooked, which is a skill for calamari. The ""biscuit"" was really just a piece of bread that gets hard to eat really fast. The mussels and clam bits were super bland. 
I was looking at the paintings of what seemed like Sicilian grandmas, and thinking they would not be happy to see this.",24/4/2024,Food & Beverage

Randazzo's Clam Bar,5,"Randazzo's is a legend. Rating it is like rating the Statue of Liberty. Some of the reviews that I've read claim that it doesn't live up to its reputation. I disagree. This is not your upper east side Italian. They do a small number of things extremely well, and if you stick to their sweet spot you'll have a great meal. If you don't know Randazzo's, the sweet spot is the red sauce. I like mine hot, but both are sublime. The epitome of  neapolitan cooking.

The supposed flounder filet was served in a soupy broth and was tasteless. The baked clams had a pasty bread crumb filling that was also tasteless. I bet those clams come stuffed and frozen for their use because those were not fresh shucked clams. The fried shrimp and calamari was ok but the serving was small and the famous sauce tasted like it had too much sugar in it.

Randazzo's Clam Bar,5,"I have been coming to this restaurant for over 35 years. This is definitely a Brooklyn landmark at Sheepshead Bay. There is a small parking lot for the customers. As soon as I entered the restaurant my kids and I were greeted and seated right away. Staff is super friendly. For starters I started with an order of Mozzarella sticks and Littlenecks clams. Their mozzarella sticks are hands down the best. Super light and flaky and super cheesy. Clams are always super clean. Lets just talk about there sauce. The best red sauce ever. Super flavorful!  For main course I ordered the Lobster Randazzo which brings a whole lobster split in 4, 3 shrimps, 4 clams in a lemon, butter, garlic, and wine sauce. Served with choice of pasta. I ordered Lobster Fra Diavolo which brings a Lobster cut up in 4 pieces, 3 shrimps, 3 clams, 6 mussels in red spicy sauce. The sauce has just the right amount of heat. Pasta was served underneath all the seafood. The lobster was meaty and super flavorful. For those who like to have a drink they have a small selection of bottled beer and wine. 

Overall this is a great spot if your looking to eat good quality seafood.",1/3/2022,Food & Beverage
Randazzo's Clam Bar,5,"Maybe the best Italian restaurant this side of Sheepshead Bay. Sure, it'd debatable, but we have not had any disappointment.

We found out that they delivered and they were prompt, on time and the food is hot. And very tasty. Will order in more, but nothing beats eating in their establishment.

Randazzo's Clam Bar,1,"I ordered food over the phone with Pauline Jr. There was a misunderstanding regarding the salad I asked for. When I reached home and took the salad out of the bag it was wrong. I called back and spoke to Pauline Jr. about receiving the wrong things and was advised to come back the following day since it was late. I when back and asked for Pauline Jr. and was told he was not there today, after waiting for 5 minutes the cook came to ask me I wanted to order (I extended to reorder since I was there), I decided to grab the attention of the women who was sitting behind the counter on her phone. I started to explain what happened she completely cut me off told me that she only work there and she would not speak to me about the wrong items asked if I could speak to the manager which then she said she was the manager, I asked her could she call Pauline, she replied no she wasn't going to call anybody. She had a very nasty attitude about the entire situation, proceeded to pull a menu out and say there's no substitutions, I advised her that the order was placed over the phone not on location and asked her why was she being so nasty about the situation and to call Paulie Jr. which she refused then sat down in the chair and starting talking to another guy about her not dealing with the this over a salad. I will never go back to this place ever again as I believe this was racially motivatedI.

Let's just start with that. The lobster filling was tasteless and had a licorice flavor. I would not consider that burger bun with cheap lobster meat a lobster roll under any circumstances. The grilled octopus was rubbery and not edible. Their special salad that we asked for chicken with... made us order another entree instead of just doing a side of grilled chicken. The clam chowder was ok but that was the only thing that tasted good. Been coming here since I was little. But never again. Place was empty too.

Randazzo's Clam Bar,4,"We had taken my mother -- a New Yorker living in Georgia -- on a 'this is your life' car trip around Brooklyn.  It culminated at Randazzo's, a clam bar that's been around I think longer than me... and I'm old!

I recently saw Randazzo's calamari on a list of 50 Iconic Restaurant Dishes, so ordering a portion was a no-brainer.  One can get either a spicy or medium hot sauce.  We chose medium.  The calamari was crisp and good -- but iconic.....?  That would be a stretch.

We all got clams which we slurped down.  I was happy with the white wine and garlic sauce.  My husband, sampling my mother's, said next time he'll order their richer, red sauce. Red or white,  both were great to sop up bread.

While it's a laid back, bare bones dining room, the place isn't cheap.  And the portions, as you can see in my clam photo, aren't particularly generous.  But Randazzo's is a Sheepshead Bay institution, that continues to attract people from all over.

Cherry stones- as plump, clean chewy as id remembered. A bit salty, inherently.

Randazzo's Clam Bar,4,"Came here on a whim after hearing so much about it. Even when I lived in the Bronx my grandma would mention driving down to Brooklyn for this, which speaks to its legacy and demand. That being said, it was destined to be tried. 

We started with a large calamari dish, for me, reminiscent of the late Roccos Calamari(if youre from the bay ridge/dyker heights area). This is soft, tender, incredibly fried calamari with a well complimenting tomato sauce.

Entree wise, my uncle had a lobster roll, one of the biggest I have seen, for a great price point. I have never seen this man unable to finish food, but when we found him picking off bread to maximize lobster, we knew this was the one. Other than that, I had the stuffed shrimp, and honestly it was disappointing. Every other dish came as a great portion size and was very well presented. This was meh. Decent flavor, and then shrimp is shrimp, its always good but so much more could be done with this.

The days winner by far was my wifes seafood fra diavolo that had her pulling out full lobster tails. This is honestly for two people. I literally took half, including all mussels and clams, and not only was she full, but she had some to take home. Well after we crossed the finish line, we were still sliding bread through that delicious sauce.

Greatly appreciated good food and hospitality, now I know where to go when in the sheepshead bay area.",26/5/2019,Food & Beverage
Randazzo's Clam Bar,1,"Came with a friend. Sat at the counter.  This is about my order.  Lobster bisque + linguini w/white clam sauce.  This should be called lobster puree - there was not one single piece of lobster in the cup.  It had not even a single hint of tasting like lobster.  The linguini was cooked nicely and although it looked to be very tasty, it was extremely dry with a small amount of sauce in the dish.  Portion size was very nice.  There was barely a taste of garlic and though a lot of chopped clams, they had simply no taste.
NO BREAD - I ordered a pasta dish and they served no bread with it.  So I questioned myself.  Went home and visited over 15 websites which clearly indicate Bread Is Serviced with Pasta!  Where's the bread Randazzos?

Cost -  Extremely high.  2 Pasta dishes, one cup of soup, 1 tiny bottle of white wine, 1 can diet coke  $ 118.00 + tip n tax.  We sat at the counter, service was good.",17/10/2023,Food & Beverage
Randazzo's Clam Bar,3,"I've been here many years ago and I quite enjoyed it, however, I went again recently and it was absolutely a disappointment. 

Let's start off with the positive side, the seafood was very fresh! Amazing oysters actually. And my meal was starting very well! It was extremely sweet oysters and adding that sour lemon made an amazing combination.
Then the second plate was the Steam Littleneck Clams. This was absolutely disappointing. It's said to be cooked with white sauce, but all I could taste was watery sauce. It was bland with no taste. The garlic in it did not even help the flavor. And dipping the bread in the sauce was like bread with water. 
Lastly, the pasta wad the same as littleneck clams. I ordered White Clams Sauce Pasta and it was all soggy and no taste. Just like I said, everything was BLAND. 
At this point the food wasn't enough to fill me up but I just couldn't order more because I knew it would all taste the same. Bland. Tasteless.

Now, as for the service, i had 2 waiters. One was very nice lady who took my orders and the other just threw the plates to my table. Moreover I was sitting in a table of 4 and the lady just threw the plates to the other end of the table instead of putting it in my side. I was not mad, but since the US have this system of tipping certain percentage, I would rather tip for a better service.

The reason for 3 stars is only because of the seafood freshness otherwise I would give lower. 
I hope they change back to the good old restaurant that was before. I really liked it before",25/2/2021,Food & Beverage

Randazzo's Clam Bar,5,"Wonderful food, wonderful vibe.  Superb raw cherrystones at a good price, and a terrific, generous bowl of zuppa di mussels in a perfect red sauce that was very flavorful without overwhelming the mussels.  Seafood doesn't need to be loaded up with all kinds of stuff, it needs to be at the forefront and it needs to be fresh and well prepared.  They seem to get that - the food isn't pretentious, it's just great. 

Our waitress was very helpful and nice when we asked roughly 1,000 questions. She, and the restaurant in general, was very laid back and very welcoming.  It's a comfortable place that, unlike so many restaurants now, doesn't blare music or TV, doesn't try to upsell you every 15 seconds, and doesn't mess with classics.

Randazzo's Clam Bar,5,"I saw this place on No Reservations years ago. Somehow it popped into my head which was quite hazy from Saturday night festivities. Headed out to Sheepshead Bay and I am glad I did (note: will def be back in the Summer for the full beach experience).

Randazzo's is a no BS red sauce Italian American joint. The seafood was very fresh. We went with combo app (mussels, shrimp, calamari and scungili), steamed calamari and the epic fra diavolo. And of course took a advantage of the homemade spicy red sauce. Slipped a few Peronis in for good measure. 

Service quick. Servers friendly. Atmosphere homey.

Randazzo's Clam Bar,5,"This place is an old time favorite of mine. It's my family's go-to seafood place for the freshest seafood  (they've been coming here since before I was even born LOL).

Clam Chowder Soup -- my favorite place to get this. It's not too thick and not overloaded with potatoes. 

We always get the Fried Calamari -- it has a light and crisp coating that's fried perfectly so that its still very tender. What makes it even better is their Special Marinara sauce! Make sure to save some and DIP your bread in it! 

Their Cherry Stone Clams -- always so fresh and meaty! Haven't had these in so long and they definitely hit the spot. 

Mussels -- amazing as always. Their mussels are so juicy and the sauce is the best part. I could literally drink it, and I do. But I recommend also dipping your bread in it. 

The Shrimp Scampi -- tbh it was a little bland; had to sprinkle a lot of Parmesan and even add a little salt to it. Ended up dipping some of it into the mussel sauce but the shrimp was good.",11/5/2021,Food & Beverage

Randazzo's Clam Bar,4,"Loved the New England Clam Chowder! If i lived in the area, I would probably order this clam chowder to-go, often. Enjoyed the crisp, lightly breaded fried calamari.  Boyfriend thought the dipping sauce for the calamari wasn't tasty, however, he still enjoyed the calamari.  We were both disappointed with the baked little necks clams after looking forward to them. I'm sad to say the taste reminded me of stale seasoned breading :(.

Was in the area yesterday for a whale watching cruise which ended at 8:30pm. The restaurant was a 3 minute walk from the pier. We opted for outdoor dining. The restaurant has a window where you can order solely for take-out and take-away. Right next to the window is a (confusing) line if you want seating for outdoor dining service. You could tell that the people joining the line were not sure if they were in line for the take-out window or for outdoor dining. It was also a Saturday night, and the whole street of restaurants was busy and surprisingly packed. My boyfriend and I were seated in about 10 minutes. After ordering, the food arrived within 10 minutes.

Customer service: 5/5. Our server and the staff overall(host/hostess, busser, server) were respectful and pleasant to interact with! Even though the restaurant was bustling, the service was prompt. The servers were attentive and quick to bring out napkins, utensils, drinks and our check.
Cleanliness: 3/5. Our table was wiped down before being seated, however, there was tomato sauce splattered on the ground below our table and we had to prop our shoes on to the legs of the table to avoid tomato-soles. 
Food: 4/5. Soup 5/5 , Calamari 4.5/5, Baked clams 2/5",9/8/2020,Food & Beverage
Randazzo's Clam Bar,4,"This was my first time in the area and at this place. It was a great summer meal, and satisfied my lobster roll craving. The staff is friendly, and there's a lot of benches/picnic tables for outdoor dining. We weren't made aware of this when given the menu, but everything is a couple dollars more than what is listed for outdoor seating. I get that places are struggling and I don't mind the extra cost but it would have been nice to know that at the start. In general, I would come back again!

In terms of the food:
-Lobster rolls: the lobster roll was fresh and was a big portion. It was different than a typical lobster roll as it's served on a brioche roll! I also loved that we were given the options for the sides. I opted for the zucchini fries which were delicious. I would get this again!
-clam chowder: it was delicious and hit the spot. Would recommend!
-calamari: it was really fresh and the crisp was perfection! Again, would recommend & a great appetizer to share.
-lobster bisque: the flavor was good altogether, but I thought it could have been creamier and with fewer peppers.",14/8/2020,Food & Beverage
Randazzo's Clam Bar,5,"A classic. Yummy seafood. Super casual but really good food. Start with some oysters, fried zucchini or scampi or clams.

Randazzo's Clam Bar,5,"My girlfriend took me the after raving about this place.  I'm sooooo glad she did - the food is absolutely delicious!

Since you still can't eat inside restaurants in NYC I was glad there was outdoor tables.  You place your order at the window and hopefully find a place to sit.

I ordered the New England Clam Chowder soup and shrimp parmigiana with spaghetti.  My girlfriends ordered two dozen cherry neck clams and we shared everything.  Can I say those were the freshest clams I think I have ever eaten.  They were so good that I got a 1/2 dozen as well.  The soup was to die for (I ordered a small and regretted not getting a large).  The shrimp parm and spaghetti was delicious as well!  I was sooooo stuffed but very happy when I left.

Let me say that this place isn't cheap, but it's definitely worth the price.  So much so that we're planning on going back there again this weekend!",22/6/2020,Food & Beverage
Randazzo's Clam Bar,4,"Just as advertised!

To be honest, prior to my latest visit I never knew Randazzo's was featured on Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations in 2012, and nor did I need it to be featured on that show to know that this institution existed near me. For almost all of my life, I lived near one of the great seafood establishments in Brooklyn, located way too far south for some to ""trek"" to, but very well worth the long train ride.

I had once visited the restaurant a long time ago, way before I knew what good food was, so it only made sense for me to make the pilgrimage back ... and that time was now! I dropped in with my wife on MLK day and the restaurant was fairly quiet compared to the spring and summer nights where I passed by. By the end of the evening when we left at 8pm, the restaurant only had 6-7 parties inside, which we honestly did not mind since it was nice and peaceful.

From the moment we stepped in, till the moment we left, the service was fantastic. ALL, and I cannot stress this enough, ALL of the waiters and waitresses were extremely friendly throughout the evening -- to us and to other parties. The menu was pretty daunting as there were many seafood and Italian dishes to choose from, so we did our research on the more popular dishes way before we walked in. Based on our research, and the flavors our tastebuds love, we went with the following:

New England Clam Chowder (Bowl)
- Hearty and very tasty. There was a fair amount of potatoes and clams inside. Since it was cold outside, the warm chowder really hit the spot. On the bad side, there were a few sandy spots in the chowder, but not enough to really bother us that much.

Baked Clams (Cherry Stones)
- Another winner. Unfortunately, there were only 10 clams in the order because we could have easily just kept on going and going and going. The clams were big and baked really well. The breading used on the clams were very flavorful, especially when the squeezed lemon was sprinkled onto it.

Fried Calamari (with sauce on top)
- This is the dish many come here for and it did not disappoint. The red sauce was so tasty and just right. It wasn't too thick and wasn't too liquidity either. The calamari was easy to chew thru and fried well. The batter on the calamari maybe could have used a little bit more crunch, but the sauce really softened it up quickly, so the crunchiness of them wouldn't last long.

Shrimp Fra Diavolo (On A Bed Of Pasta shrimp, clams & mussels in a red spicy sauce)
- Probably our least favorite dish, but that probably has more to do with our preferences. We decided to order this since we saw so many pictures of it. Unfortunately, the sauce was a bit more watery than we liked and we weren't big fans of the entire dish because it was basically just linguine with red sauce and seafood. With that said, it still wasn't that bad and pretty flavorful. I'm more of a chicken parm pasta dish kind of guy, so this was far from my 1st choice, but we went with it anyway to share.

Overall, we really couldn't complain. The restaurant wasn't crowded on the night we went and the food was good. Like I said earlier, the service was also excellent and the folks working there couldn't be more friendly. Are there a few things they could fix? Sure ... but it wasn't the end of the world and none of the negative things ruined our meal.

FYI - For you T-shirt collectors, they sell T-shirts advertising the restaurant.",16/1/2018,Food & Beverage
Randazzo's Clam Bar,3,"All Lobster Rolls are NOT the same!
Unfortunately, I paid $67.60 for three food items (lobster bisque / Manhattan clam chowder mix and two ""lobster rolls""  -  one with a baked potato and the other with french fries.  We expected to receive sweet (knuckle / claw / tail) lobster on warm classic buttered ""lobster"" buns.  However, what we received were lobster salad sandwiches, which did not resemble or taste like classic lobster rolls.
Because of my prior Randazzo's seafood experiences, we incorrectly believed their lobster rolls would be a pièce de résistance similar to Maine's lobster rolls.  Randazzo's french fries were fried to perfection where you heard a crisp sound when they were bitten.  Additionally, my request for a lobster bisque / Manhattan clam chowder mix tasted GREAT and was simply divine!!",15/4/2021,Food & Beverage
Randazzo's Clam Bar,1,"I have come to learn that many ""positive"" reviews.......are lies. Yesterday (4/7/23)  I was at Randazzos in Sheepshead Bay Brooklyn and here is my review:

The flounder fish fillet did NOT taste fresh at all
The cherry stones clams I still can taste in my mouth a day later

The seafood assortment prior to dinner and later the pasta was ""acceptable""

The dining room setup inside isn't fancy by any stretch of imagination. It's minimalist at most. That adds to the classic clam bar ambience, I suppose. As a whole package, however, Randazzo's would likely benefit by matching their pricing to more than just the food they serve. For their price range, I expect, at minimum, luxury seating and a wine list.",15/6/2023,Food & Beverage
Randazzo's Clam Bar,5,"Small, casual, somewhat cafeteria-looking and utterly iconic.  It's one of those places that's definitively Brooklyn.  I regard this as ""New York City iconic"" as Carnegie Deli or Balthazar.  They were MIA for a year after hurricane Sandy, and I thanked the Gods when they came back.

The food here is A+.  Unlike 90% of all the Italian restaurants in NYC, their sauce isn't sh*t.  This place has great sauce: one taste, and you'll understand why the sell it in take-home jars.

The sauces are great, and the seafood is utterly fresh.  A meal here really hits the spot if you're hankering for shellfish.

I honestly don't understand how this restaurant isn't 5/5 stars by anyone's standards.  The waitresses can be a little cheeky in an old-school Italian kind of way, but that's part of the charm of this iconic clam bar.


Little Necks: A+
Cherry Stones A-
Oysters: A+
Just... perfection.  Fresh, clean tasting, and almost cathartic.  As far as I'm concerned, the best in NYC.  You'll want to load them up with the following (in order):
1. horseradish
2. shrimp cocktail sauce
3. Squeezed lemon juice
4. An oyster cracker for the clams, two oyster crackers for the oyster.
There's a bit too much meat on the cherry stones for my liking: still delicious, but your chew is mostly clam rather than an amalgam of clam with accoutrements.

Shrimp Cocktail: A
Beautiful, humongous, soft, tasty shrimp.  Phenomenal cocktail sauce.  The best.

Lobster Fra Diavolo: A+
I've had an awful lot of Fra Diavolo in my life, and this is one of the best.  The secret?  Their sauce.  It's tremendous!  I'd say medium to light on the heat index.  If you're ok with semi-spicy food, you can order this and let them use their default spice level.  Pro-Tip: They create the sauce from scratch when you order the dish.  If you like sauces, I would order this dish ""with extra, extra sauce"" to make sure you get enough sauce.  Seriously, it's stupid good.

Marinated Burned Chicken: C
Sauce is very good; it tastes like a butter and wine sauce (I was expecting marinara so this was a surprise and I ended up liking it).  However, the chicken was unforgivably dry.  Some pieces were OK, but the majority of it had to be choked down with water.  I'm not sure whether it was overcooked at the outset or simply warmed in a microwave for too long, but either way, this dish is no bueno.  No amount of sauce would've helped this dish.

Stuffed Filet: A+
This is flounder stuffed with crab meat and tiny shrimp.  Nicely charred on the outside, a delicious sauce that can hardly be believed.  The dish is juicy and delicious.  It's as good as my mom used to make it.",5/9/2019,Food & Beverage

But I really came here for the raw clams. Tried their Seafood Fra Diavlo (MP was $50) and it's amazing! I feel some type of way with tomato sauce, I'm usually a white sauce pasta person.

My Dad passed away four years ago, so coming back to this place really means a lot to me. I associated food with fond memories of my childhood. 

I brought my husband with me. It's his first time here. I ordered my dad's favorite dishes, fried calamari with marinara sauce, half a dozen of cherry stone clams, shrimp scampi, and clam chowder. The taste of the food and the restaurant settings made me feel that my dad was still sitting next to me. It was as good as how I remember it.

Randazzo's Clam Bar,3,"This is really a 3.5 star review but that's not possible on here so just go with it. While I should have taken a picture of my dinner last night, I simply didn't feel like it but rest assured there are plenty of pictures already uploaded on here of the dish I got that are very accurate. 

I was seriously craving a stuffed lobster from Lobster House Joes on Staten Island but was not in the mood to travel all the way over there and back so I literally searched all of Ubereats to try and find something similar. I got tired of searching and was going to order something from Anthony's in sheepshead bay but something told me to just type in Stuffed Lobster in the search bar and this place popped up. That's when I came here and saw pics of the dish and decided to go ahead and order, it looked very very similar to Joe's just a tad more expensive. 

I called and asked them if it was possible to switch out the side options for some simple pasta and oil w/ garlic but apparently that wasn't allowed even if I paid extra? Idk I thought that was stupid, I'm paying almost $50 for a plate of lobster, why would I want French fries or fried zucchini? This forced me to get an extra side order of pasta which cost me $11. I was pretty annoyed lol, it was a small aluminum container of spaghetti and marinara, that's it that's all for $11. The lobster arrived in an aluminum tray and could have easily fed 2 people. The stuffing was good but nothing amazing tbh, there were more shrimp and breadcrumbs than anything else, barely any crab or lobster and a slight hint of cheese, so was it better than Joes? No definitely not. BUT, the lobster was good and I still have some stuffing left. I would definitely order again, I just most likely wouldn't get this dish cause it doesn't compare to what I'm used to. Maybe I'll go for something grilled next time.",12/6/2021,Food & Beverage
Randazzo's Clam Bar,5,"This is the most authentic Italian food I've had to date outside of Italy. The clam chowder was to die for and was the perfect appetizer. I got the mussel, clam, and calamari combo with spicy sauce and it did not disappoint. The spicy sauce was very authentic and tasted home made. I also highly recommend you get the $6 Pinot Grigio. It comes in a cute glass and the wine doesn't taste cheap although the price of it is!!",3/8/2021,Food & Beverage
Randazzo's Clam Bar,1,"It's been about three years since my last visit to this restaurant.  Always remember that I've had great dinners here.  This time was a disaster.  After mediocre clam chowder my wife and I looked forward to having the Octopus special.  When the plate arrived it looked appetizing.  We both had trouble cutting the first piece with a knife.  When we chewed the first piece it was like rubber.  We both had to spit out the piece because we couldn't chew it.  The waitress was gracious and immediately arranged for credit.  We then received the macaroni dish.  The sauce was no better than canned Buitoni.  We couldn't finish that either but I elected to pay for it anyway.  

It makes me sad to write a review like this for a place with so much great history.  I hope the grandchildren who now operate it wake up and realize that if they keep this up they will eventually lose the business.  Also cash only?????",24/4/2023,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"Being Taiwanese American, the much anticipated opening of Din Tai Fung in New York City did not disappoint. I am writing this review after my second visit to provide a more well rounded feedback.

Now that the restaurant has been around for a while, the walk-in experience is a lot more manageable in case a reservation wasn't secured ahead. There are also bar seatings for any small parties.

We have tried a variety of dishes and our favorites consist of pork xiao long bao (budget about 1 serving for two people), spicy wontons, sticky rice shao mai, Taiwanese cabbage, and minced pork noodle.  Though the xiao long bao quality wasn't consistent between both visits where the most recent one felt a bit dry. 

Services were friendly overall, but not timely. We had to remind different servers on getting a lid for the hot tea, which never arrived. It was also a bit confusing on which server would remove the empty plate vs just delivering dishes. The server from our first visit checked on us a few times during the meal while the server from our second visit only came by once to see if we needed to order desserts.

Lastly, we asked for extra ginger during the 2nd visit, but the server never mentioned the extra $3 charge. It is just honest business conduct to share that info so that it is not a surprise. Needless to say, it left a bit of a sour taste for me.",5/8/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,3,"I have been dying to try this restaurant for years as it's been super viral online. Finally they opened a location and New York so I knew I had to visit it next time I was in NY. I got a reservation for a Saturday night and only had to wait about 10-15 mins before I was sat.

Overall the service was good I had zero complaints. I do have to say though it was a little overhyped and honestly nothing out of this world. I don't know if I would come back but if I did it would be strictly for the spicy chicken wontons.

I was most excited to try the chocolate bao buns but they were not what I had imagined. Overall nice restaurant with a great ambiance but not out of this world either!",7/8/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"Made reservations in advanced and waited about 10 minutes to be seated after first check in. This restaurant is massive and located below with its romantic and dark decor, but the open concept of watching bunch of chefs make dumplings is a sight.

Din Tai Fung,3,"Ok, here's the story.  I am a huge Din Tai Fung fan.  I have been to so many locations around Asia and the other US locations in LA and this was the most expensive and worst experience of all of them I am sad to say.

While it still has many of the charms of the other locations, and even at it's worst performance is still a delicious experience, I was just so excited for a NY DTF experience, and was let down.

We ordered a some cocktails, a couple of xiao long bao dishes (one pork, one chicken), fried rice, cod dumplings and of course dessert.  

The pork xiao long bao was undercooked with the wrapper still chewy, the chicken looked as if it had been dropped because they were all clumped together, so the meal did not start out well.  

From there the dishes did improve and we really enjoyed the cod dumplings (new to us) and of course their famous fried rice - which did not disappoint. 

As for the cocktails, I think this was the highlight of the meal.  We had the sesame espresso martini and the yuzu margarita.  The sesame espresso martini was the best espresso martini I have ever had and the yuzu margarita was also nice and refreshing.

Dessert was really a bit disappointing to us as well.  Having had their chocolate xiao long bao and their sesame dumplings in the past at other locations, these were 10x the sweetness of their Asian locations.  the chocolate xiao long bao was made with a super sweet milk chocolate instead of dark chocolate and their sesame dumplings had so much sugar that we did not finish either dish.

Service was meh - and the ambiance was an upscale homage to the Din Tai Fung mothership.

While I continue to be a Din fan, I don't see myself returning to the NY location any time soon.",2/8/2025,Food & Beverage

Din Tai Fung,5,"The location is great for if you're staying in Times Square as you can quickly walk there but make sure you have a reservation! They do accommodate walk-in parties but for us, it took about 90 minutes to get in (luckily we grabbed a drink nearby during the wait). 

Once they texted that our table was ready, it was a quick check-in process and we were seated not long after. We had 6 in our party and were given a nice round table where it wasn't too loud. 

We all ordered wine or cocktails and each asked the server what he'd suggest based on what we were ordering and he gave thoughtful suggestions. Additionally, we received suggestions on dishes as well. As we were doing family style, we ordered a ton of food from soup dumplings to cucumber salad. 

While some of the food was a bit too spicy for me (as I have 0 spice tolerance), everything was clearly called out on the menu so I knew what I'd be trying and all the food tasted pretty good!

Din Tai Fung,4,"I've been dying to enjoy DTF since trying it the first time a few months ago. The only location in the east coast happens to be right near Broadway. I would definitely make a reservation here. You walk in this glass building and down the stairs is the check in area. We were given a buzzer while our table is getting prepared. A few minutes later and we got called and walked to our table. The place is intimate, classy but no need to dress up or anything. 

Our server was snappy and quick but it rubbed me the wrong way when she took our menus while placing an order. I suppose we should have just written out our order, but totally forgot that was an option. While I've had better XLB, if it's your first time here, then get it just to see what the hype is about. This time around though, we ordered the chicken XLB (there's never enough soup in my opinion but the filling was tasty), pork buns (didn't try but hubby thought it was okay), fried rice with fried pork chop (my personal fave), cucumber salad (don't pass on this) and the chocolate mochi XLB for dessert with the sea salt cream.

We started with the famous cucumber salad, but honestly, it was a little underwhelming just tasted like plain cucumbers I could easily make at home.

The garlic string beans, on the other hand, were unexpectedly amazing, super crunchy and addictive. We also got the chicken xiao long bao, which were really juicy and flavorful, though a bit fragile; a couple of them broke from the soup weight, but they still tasted great. The chicken fried noodles were my absolute favorite. I kept going back for more and basically devoured the entire plate myself.

We also tried the spicy chicken wontons. They weren't my personal favorite, but the rest of the table loved them and said they were the standout. The drinks were yummy too. I can't remember exactly which ones we got, but when one of us accidentally spilled hers, the staff rushed over, cleaned it up immediately, and brought her a fresh drink without hesitation.

Our waiter was so pleasant and attentive throughout. For dessert, we got the chocolate mochi xiao long bao, which were unreal. The sea salt cream they came with was so good I was eating it by itself and yes, we ordered extra just for that. It's supposed to come with five pieces, but ours had only four, and our waiter noticed without us saying anything and brought us a whole new tray. That kind of service really stood out.",25/7/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,5,"Oh man it did not disappoint! The space is absolutely gorgeous. One of the coolest parts is being able to watch the team making dumplings through the glass; such a fun touch.

Service was good, nothing over the top, but quick, efficient, and friendly. The menu had a surprising number of vegan options, all clearly labeled (huge plus!).

Food-wise, the vegan spicy wontons were a highlight, not spicy per se, but super flavorful with a bright, acidic kick that made them so satisfying. The vegan buns were really delicious too! It was a yummy mushroom filling. The chili oil they serve is next-level. I'd bottle that stuff if I could.

The cucumber salad was fresh and light, though probably not something I'd rush to order again. But the rice cakes? Magical. Chewy, perfectly cooked, and packed with flavor. 

And the lychee martinis? Out. Of. This. World. Fruity, fragrant, and dangerously drinkable.

All in all, highly recommend. Definitely planning to go back!",19/7/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"Beautiful restaurant and had a lovely server (didn't catch her name but she was great). Ordered two crab xlb, green beans, beef noodle soup and chocolate xlb.

Crab XLB: 5/5 really appreciate how clean this XLB tasted. Good crab to pork ratio, nice flavors and wrapper wasn't too thick.

Green beans: 4/5 very crispy (haven't found this level of crispiness in other restaurants) but a bit too oily/salty for me. 

Beef Noodle Soup: 3/5 a bit underwhelming, especially for a $21 dish. Beef is very tender. Flavor is OK - have had better and worse beef noodle soups but this was the smallest and most expensive one I've had. 

Chocolate XLB: 3/5 ordered this bc of the positive reviews. Honestly it tastes exactly like what it sounds like. Chocolate in XLB wrapper. Chocolate wasn't especially good and the XLB wrapper was undercooked. The best part was the sea salt cream our server recommended (additional $1.50 on top of the $14 dish) 

Overall, it was a decent but expensive experience (lunch for a total of $130 for two). If I go again, it'd be for the vibes and savory xlb only.",23/7/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,5,"Finally made it to Din Tai Fung after hearing great things from my friends in Hong Kong. 
Our party was two adults and 2 children and we arrived early on Friday evening and would say everything from food, service and ambiance was top notch!
We were seated quickly and our server Sam was very kind and knowledgeable. They have a great selection of various iced teas as well as a full bar for beer and cocktails.
We ordered the soup dumplings, cucumber salad, string beans,  shrimp fried rice, beef scallion, and fried noodles.
The soup dumplings were the star of the show for sure, but the rice and string beans were close second. The beef was good too but it was more like a sautee vs. traditional steak.
For desert we had chocolate dumplings and mango ice desert. Both excellent! Unique and great experience, especially for kids as they get to see how dumplings are made.
Will surely return soon",20/7/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,5,"My friend and I came here for dinner on a Sunday evening and it was PACKED! I highly suggest making a reservation in advance. You can do so on Yelp. 

The staff is very courteous and the food service was quite fast, considering how busy they were. They had all glass walls looking into the kitchen so you can see the staff prepping the dumplings. It's a bit dark inside but it in does well for the sleek modern vibe.

We ordered an assortment of dumplings and baos from their menu and all of them tasted delicious!  My favorite was the spicy wontons. That spicy sauce must be homemade because it was the perfect amount of savory to spice and it was delicious  we wanted to put that sauce on all of our dumplings. The dumpling skins were soft and thin and the fillings inside were flavorful and the Xiao Long Baos had just the perfect amount of broth in them.

I can't wait to come back to try the rest of their menu!",12/7/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,5,"DTF never fails to disappoint! We ordered the classic soup dumplings and some bubble tea as a late night snack. Both were very tasty. Service speed was reasonable given the wait. Even with booking a reservation in advance, we still had to wait at least 10 minutes for our table. The ambiance was casual and upbeat. Would defs come back!",9/8/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,5,"I finallyyyy got to try this place! And I was very impressed. I made reservations for 2 since we decided to come on 4th of July, it was quite busy. We were greeted by the hosts and given a buzzer to notify us when the table was ready. We didn't wait too long but they do have a really nice seating area if you need to hang out for a bit. The whole restaurant is actually classy and stunning and a nice place to do a birthday dinner or something like that. The chic and modern interior makes for great photos. 

Vincent was our server, he was polite and efficient. Like in traditional dim sum spots, you order on a paper menu and the waiter confirms prior to sending it in. On to the important part, the food. We had the pork xiao long bao (10/10), the chicken dumplings (8/10), spicy pork and shrimp wontons (8.5/10), sesame noodles (9/10), and shrimp fried rice (7/10). I think the shrimp fried rice was pretty mediocre, but I don't think you could go wrong with any of the soup dumplings or wontons. I definitely recommend the pork xiao long bao, they were flavorful and the perfect size. Next time I come back I do want to try the string beans, shumai and fried noodles! I'll be sure to report back when I do!",4/7/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"I walked by this place after getting off at the 50th Street subway station and was intrigued. A friend mentioned it was good, so I made a last-minute early reservation for brunch the following day.

In terms of ambiance and decor, this restaurant is beautiful. No notes. It feels clean and fresh, modern yet traditional, and even has windows to see the dumpling making. Would be a great vibe for either family dining or a date (or brunch with friends, as was my case).

Menu highlights definitely include the sea salt cream black tea and the chocolate buns. I would drink that tea every day if I could--it was amazing. The chocolate buns (which you can get with a side of that same sea salt cream) were like little lava cakes and so good. As for the savory food, all of it was fine. The ribs had the BEST sauce, but I'm not a rib person--I wish the sauce came on something else--but my friends loved them. The soup dumplings were good, but not as amazing as I expected for a place known for its soup dumplings. I did not enjoy the diced beef noodles, though my friend did. The black sesame espresso martini was good--and an NYC exclusive.

In the end, I would recommend this restaurant and would consider coming back, though I would probably try some different things. But the tea alone would make me return!",11/8/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,5,"growing up i watched a lot of youtube videos, and one of the most memorable types were food reviews. i remember seeing this restaurant and being more than disappointed when i found out they didn't have a new york location. you could probably imagine my surprise once i saw they were opening one in the city. 

let's start off with the reservations. the hype has died down tremendously, i believe on their site they have a waitlist so you can join if it's a spur of  the moment sort of thing. i still prefer to book my reservations through yelp. when you walk in, you had down the steps and are met with architectural beauty. the space is dimly lit with water features and it's extremely spacious.  i checked in at the host stand and we had to wait maybe 3 minutes for our table to be ready.

when you sit down, you are immediately greeted and they ask if you have ever been to the establishment. everything is pretty straightforward. you get a menu to see the items and their description, along with an ordering sheet. you put the quantity next to the items you want & you can ask for modifications once someone comes back to put the sheet in. 

i started off with the black tea with sea salt foam. it was very good. would get it again. we ordered the pork and crab xiao long bao, my only critique is that they could've been warmer. i don't think i would get these again. next up were the sweet and sour pork baby back ribs. amazing, 10/10. no notes, i could eat these alone. 

shrimp fried rice and garlic string beans were next to hit the table. i felt like the rice was lacking a bit in flavor but when you mixed it with other items such as the ribs, wonton sauce or soy sauce & vinegar mixture it was good. probably would skip this next time. the garlic string beans were a must have. i don't really care that they're $18, i'd spend that again. 

then we had the spicy chicken wontons and the spicy noodles. i enjoyed both of these a lot. i'm a sucker for dim sum so if i could just eat bowls of wontons, dumplings, etc i would. i saw mixed reviews on the noodles but i thought they were fanatic and i'd get them again.

we ordered some lychee martinis once there was some food in our system and it was great. the lychee was nice in size too. for dessert you know we had to get the chocolate xiao long bao. if i could've gotten 3 orders of these with the sea salt cream, i would've. we also got an order of these taro dumplings, please skip this. 

overall, i enjoyed the experience. must haves are the sweet & sour ribs, green beans, spicy wontons & chocolate dumplings.",9/8/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,I've eaten ate at Din Tai Fung in Singapore & HK and this location did not disappoint. It was fun to watch non-asian staff making all the dumplings through the glass window. Color me impressed - the differentiated thin skins of this Taiwanese originated xialong bao (soup dumpling) is in tact and brough back wonderful memories of times when I had this with my family.,9/8/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"This was my second time having Din Tai Fung - my first was in Hong Kong. I had thought the soup dumplings were way too small and alright but nothing special during my first visit. Fast forward a couple of years later, I still think that about Din Tai Fung's soup dumplings. But now that my tastebuds are slightly more refined compared to back then, I would also like to say that their pork dumpling filling tastes very clean and healthy. There's not a lot of fat in the meat, the meat tastes like it's of high quality, and without an overwhelming amount of seasoning. 4/5

Their spicy chicken wonton fillings were also similar in that way. The size of the wontons were small, too. I thought the sauce could be spicier (like hot chili oil type of spicy). 3/5

The cucumber salad has a lot of copycat recipes online, so I thought I'd try the real thing. Though unassuming, the cucumber salad is actually really addicting. The freshness and crunch of each cucumber just had me going back for more. I ended up making them at home after with a copycat recipe, and I would have to say they're pretty easy to make! 5/5

Noodles with sesame sauce (with crushed peanuts and chili oil). I feel like this was a waste of money - literally just noodles with sauce,. I wasn't particularly fond of the sesame sauce. It was on the blander side even though it supposedly had chili oil. 2/5

Fried rice with fried pork chop - The rice itself was alright but a little on the blander side. At least you can see the individuality of each grain of rice. It tastes better with a bit of chili oil. I really liked the fried pork chop. I was expecting something katsu-style, but there's no breading (so it appears). It still had a nice crispy crust (not katsu level, of course), and was well seasoned. The meat tasted clean with no fats and was a good amount of tender. 4/5

Chocolate and mochi xiao long bao - I see chocolate xlb online a lot, so I've been really wanting to try it! I honestly didn't know what to expect, as I couldn't imagine chocolate in a xlb. But it was one of my favorite dishes here! The chocolate isn't overwhelmingly sweet. I couldn't tell the difference regarding the mochi and regular dumpling skin. I got a side of sea salt cream (extra $1) to go with it, and I think it was a nice touch. Couldn't really taste the cream, but it added to the texture. 5/5

This place is reservations only. They give you a 15-minute grace period if you're late, but honestly, I think you have a bit longer than that. Because after I entered, I still had to wait in a medium-sized line to check in for my reservation. Once checked in, they give you a buzzer, so you still have to wait a bit before you actually get seated. I probably waited less than 10 minutes? 

The restaurant has a really nice ambiance and definitely is going for the elevated route. There are a lot of tables inside, so many different parties at once. Each area on the floor is sectioned off and assigned to multiple waiters. But despite the crowd size, I never once felt neglected by my waiter, who was very prompt and gave us food suggestions.",20/6/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,1,"This place is totally overrated. It's obviously been hyped up by ""influencers"" because each dish was worse than the one before. It was beyond mediocre : it sucked . I went there with two of my friends took me an hour to pick my fancy clothes and we were expecting something spectacular. It was worse than if an amateur cooked. The string beans with garlic had no salt or flavor the spicy won tons had a load of horrible sauce gross we brought most of this inedible food home for our families but even they wouldnt eat it. 

For example we bought the chicken fried rice with and it had no no soy sauce just fat swollen rice with chunks of chicken 

Save your money and go someplace else. This place is a gimmick.",11/8/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,2,"This is my 3rd time at a Din Tai Fung, and confirms that I don't need to come back unless someone else wants to go. The food isn't bad, but for the price and wait, I can definitely get better food elsewhere especially XLB. The service is really nice and the room is spacious, which you appreciate for NYC. We were in and out within an hour.

Shanghai rice cakes: tried for the first time and it was a good chewy texture with a flavorful sauce. Simple and nice.

Shrimp silky wontons: this was a disappointment, the shrimp was tough compared to when I had it before. It was my favorite dish here.

Black sesame espresso martini: it's more like a cordial as it's very intense even compared to martinis. The flavor was good but do not have to get again.

Milk tea: a little watery compared to what I prefer but appreciated that it was lightly sweet.",21/6/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,5,"I'm a generous Yelper and I probably give too many 5 star reviews but this place deserves 10! It's a beautiful restaurant and the staff is happy, fun and accommodating. We were a party of 7 with a toddler and they sat us at a very comfortable table. Our waitress was so sweet with my grandson, giving him things to play with and draw on. Now, the food. Wow! I loved the chicken with rice cakes, the spicy wontons, the spareribs and the chocolate dessert buns. Everything was delicious!",3/8/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,2,"Way over priced 
Everything lacked flavor, the best thing we ordered was the pork chop
If you're used to eating dim sum this place will not do it for you.

Don't believe everything you see on Tic Tok",9/8/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,3,"The place is beautiful. The service is beautiful! 
The food is eh. 

If you want good soup dumplings and Taiwanese flavors, literally anywhere else would be better for a fraction of the price. 

If you're trying to spend & have a fine meal, sure.
The seasoning/flavor isn't the typical traditional Taiwanese flavors, it definitely feels a bit muted to cater to a certain demographic. 

Would go back for a chocolate xlb and the sea salt cream but that's about it",10/8/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"From the bright glass box entrance into the dim subterranean restaurant. The line for checkin can wrap around the bottom of the stairs. This location is a large one, but that doesn't mean you won't wait if you don't have a reservation. We had one and had a wonky check in experience where we were a little lost in the shuffle until one of the hosts took the time to sort us out. 

As the DTF empire has grown, there are definitely subtle differences between the locations. I think quality and consistency has suffered a little. That sad, I think the NYC location is one of the better U.S. locals. The food comes out quickly and it comes out hot. 

It's definitely on my list of goto's when I visit Manhattan. 

No extensive review here. You know the drill: soup dumplings, spicy wontons, beef noodle soup or any soup, cabbage, cukes, potstickers etc. just eat it all.",5/6/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"The place is enormous, it's literally a maze in here. Its perfect for every situation- group dinners, family, causal dates, celebrations. I saw they do have some smaller secluded rooms. I highly suggest getting reservations. It was pretty timely. Waited 5 mins after my reservation time to get seated.

The food is meant to be shared. They suggest 2 items per person is the rule of thumb. We had the frieporkchop fried rice; chicken dumplings; cucumber dish; wonton in their infamous sauce. The cucumber dishes pairs best if you dont eat right away, use it as a palette cleanser throughout the meal. The chicken dumplings were superb probably my favorite out of all the savory dishes. The rest lacked a bit of salt but still good.

Please don't skip the chocolate & mochi dumplings with salted cream. It was a pleasant surprise. I feel like the proper way to consume it is dipping into the cream and eating it whole to mitigate mess.

Are there better dim sum places in NYC - sure but this is a New York institution and definitely worth your time and money.",7/6/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,5,"This Michelin star restaurant specializing in their soup dumplings/xiao long bao did not disappoint! Upon entering the restaurant, you can immediately feel the luxurious and dim atmosphere, making it a moody environment for a great dinner experience. Expect a wait considering this restaurant's popularity, but there is plenty of seating in the waiting area and I would recommend making a reservation ahead of time. As a dim sum restaurant, you order using a sheet and numbering the amount of items you want to order from the menu.

The Kurobata Pork Xiao Long Bao were delicious and soft, and the Shrimp & Kurobuta Pork Pot Stickers were crispy and filling. The cucumber salad was quite refreshing and flavorful with the chili oil, and the string beans with garlic are a classic vegetable side. Additionally, the chicken wonton soup was hearty and delicious, and the soup itself was light yet savory. The most unique item I tried was the Chocolate & Mochi Xiao Long Bao, definitely worth the try if you are a chocolate fan! Having this for dessert to end off the meal was spectacular, as I was pleasantly surprised at how rich and creamy the dark chocolate inside paired so well with the mochi in a soup dumplings format. Overall, a great experience!",7/6/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,5,"Okay Din Tai Fung NYC you did not disappoint. I've only been to the LA location, and was excited to see it open here. It's still super difficult to secure a reservation and the line for walk-ins was bonkers for a Wednesday lunch crowd.

My husband and I devoured 30 soup dumplings and they were delicious. We liked the pork more than the crab. Everything we had was absolutely delicious - the sesame noodles were flavorful, wontons were great, and even the matcha milk tea was tasty. The bok choy was a bit bland but the cucumber salad was spot on. 

The restaurant is HUGE and it's got a cool, dark vibe. They also have big rooms on the side and I would love to come back with a big group.",28/5/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"Loved visiting Din Tai Fung in NYC. We had a reservation (which i recommend making in advance) and only waited a little bit for our table. The restaurant is huge with a really nice ambience. The service was a little slow in my opinion, however it was a Saturday night. However, the staff were helpful with informing us about dishes. 

The food was amazing! I would definitely recommend getting a steamed veggie (broccoli or string beans), the Xiao Long Bao, and the sweet and spicy ribs!! The spicy wontons tasted very clean, and the cucumber salad was refreshing. Overall would go back!",27/7/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,5,"Def make a reservation, the walk in line was lengthy, even for a Monday evening. The reservations update all the time, you never know when you will get an available reservation at a time you want! The xiao long bao are delicious and a must have for a first timer, the cucumber salad is also fantastic. The green beans with garlic we order every time and the rice cakes with chicken are a must order. If you aren't totally stuffed at the end of the meal, grab the chocolate xiao long bao and the sea salt foam for dessert. Together it's a knock out.",25/8/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,3,"I really wanted to like this place and was really looking forward to this reservation since we had booked this 2 weeks in advance. Reservations are required and it's hard to get for a peak mealtime unless you book a weeknight in advance.
I felt like everyone else had gone to check it out already and that we were late to the game; there is so much hype to the brand name. Unfortunately the place did not live up to their reputation.

We went on a weeknight at 6pm. When you walk in, the ambiance walking down the staircase is stunning. There is a little metal sculpture of a soup dumpling at the bottom of the staircase for photos ops. Then you check in and they give you a pager for when your table is ready. 

As you are seated, you pass by the glass wall where you can see the chefs preparing the xiao long bao (soup dumplings), which is pretty cool. The entire restaurant is lit by very pretty lanterns and you feel a sense of relaxation with the wooden / black decor. 

The food came very quickly. However this is where I felt let down. I felt that the xiao long bao were actually just average. The cucumber salad was honestly a standout, more so than the actual bao. We also enjoyed the cocktails - the sesame espresso martini (nyc exclusive) and the pear martini. 

Unfortunately, the soup dumplings have paper thin skins and lack flavor, even in the truffle soup dumplings which we were warned to have a strong flavor. The chili oil was delicious but I found I had to douse every dumpling in it. We did enjoy the cod dumplings which were surprisingly soupy and full of flavor, more than the xiao long bao.

My boyfriend and I both left the restaurant hungry.

Also subtracting a star due to the price point of the dishes. Very expensive - be prepared for a check somewhere in the ballpark of $100-$200 for a table of 2. The service was very good and there was no trouble finding a waiter when we needed.

Overall I might come back if the occasion comes up but I do think that this brand name is overrated; it is a decent soup dumpling place with classy decor and expensive dishes. Personally, I would prefer a less flashy, more down to earth restaurant for soup dumplings for a much more reasonable price. We both prefer Nan Xiang over Din Tai Fung. 

The only really ""worth-it"" points about this place are the ambiance and this high-society, exclusive feeling of eating at a fancy reservation-only spot. 

Update: originally I rated 4/5 but we both ate more later tonight and felt disappointed in the value. Minus another star. Resulting in a 3/5 rating. Not worth the price tag!",20/5/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"Made it here!!!! Had it in LA, needed to try the nyc version. Drinks are fun and server is nice and i like the bathroom. Soup dumplings lack flavor and um nothing is spicy. Sadd.

Din Tai Fung,5,"Wow! I had high expectations going in, and they were met. I'd seen this place all over tik tok, so I knew the minute we were going to New York, I had to make a reservation. We had reservations about a month ahead, and they seated us right away. 

Everything we ate was amazing but our standouts were the green beans, the pork Xiao long bao, the sesame noodles, and the chocolate bao! Our waiter was super helpful, the ambiance was very cozy and nice. I'd highly recommend!",29/5/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"As a partially Taiwanese lifelong New Yorker, I felt a moral obligation to try the new Din Tai Fung outpost at least once, despite the mixed initial reviews. I've previously been to the Arcadia and Las Vegas locations, but ironically have never made it to the Taipei flagship despite numerous visits to the island.

Overall, I think Nan Xiang XLB is a better option for Shanghainese cooking in NYC, but DTF is not bad. The vegan steamed dumplings are good, although I generally prefer a bit more bite to the dough. The mu-er (wood ear) salad had a bit too much vinegar for my taste.

The sesame noodles were actually the best thing I tasted here - not something that I recall DTF being known for, but I'd recommend ordering a bowl to share.",15/5/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,5,"YUMMY. I wish I could order everything here. Din Tai Fung is a more casual, more bustling version of Tao or Buddakan - a wide open space with trendy people, decor, and food. It was a busy night, and service was just okay here. Our waitress had a bit of a weird attitude and we felt forgotten a couple of times. 

Our food was absolutely delicious. You can't go wrong with anything, but do not skip out on the baby back ribs and obviously the Xiao Long Bao - especially the dessert! Our cocktails were also delicious. 

This is such a fun place, and is great for tourists and locals alike!",14/5/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,3,"So of course, TikTok has led me to believe I just HAD to try this restaurant, so while in New York we checked out DTF. We had a reservation but we came early and were able to get a seat earlier which was great. 

Food wise, the dim sum was meh. Didn't blow my mind away. The dumplings and the bao were very mid to me, and I've had better elsewhere. However, the food we ordered was good. I got the shrimp noodles and my brother ordered the chicken fried rice. Both were really good and shareable and we were able to split the both of it amongst the two of us.

Vibes were nice, ambiance was nice, definitely a cute place to go but it didn't blow my mind",26/5/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"Great Dumplings in a Gorgeous Space
We had a lovely lunch at Din Tai Fung on Broadway. The ambience is stunning; big, open, and beautifully designed, making it a great place to relax and enjoy a flavorful meal.
The dumplings were the real star...juicy, perfectly seasoned, and full of flavor. The Crab & Pork Xiao Long Bao and the Kimchi & Pork Dumplings were especially memorable. The shrimp & pork spicy wontons had just the right kick, and the chili oil on the side added an extra zing to everything.
The appetizers (like the seaweed salad and wood ear mushrooms) were decent but didn't quite stand out like the mains. That said, the iced green tea was refreshing and paired beautifully with the rich dumplings.
Only downside: it was super filling! We probably over-ordered, but it's hard not to with so many tempting options.

Great variety
Worth the splurge (our bill for two came to $96 before tip)

As soon as I entered the building, I was pleasantly surprised by the ambiance. The furniture and decor made the place feel high end. 

As for the food:
Cucumber salad (3/5): felt like we had to try because it was so famous. It was definitely tasty--acidic, sweet, and refreshing. But it was too pricy for what it is. I don't recommend getting it ($9). 

Kurobuta Pork Xiao Long Bao (4/5): I thought the soup dumplings were quite nice--i like how there are 10 smaller pieces. The presentation of the dumpling folds were beautiful. I thought the meat was delicious and flavorful. The meat was more dense compared to that of other XLBs.

Spicy Vegan Dumplings (5/5): I thought this was the most delicious! The sauce is scrumptious and the vegan filling was a great texture and flavor.

Chocolate and Mochi Xiao Long Baos (5/5): love the concept! It was decadent and so fun to eat, especially with a side of sea salt cream. Recommend getting this because it's hard to get this anywhere else.

Flavored Black Tea (2/5): it tastes good but it was too sweet for my liking.",16/5/2025,Food & Beverage

When we compare notes it stands out that the focus is on consistency and perfection.  We all have been a fan of the seaweed salad, but the soup dumplings are the star of the show. I found the dumplings in NYC to be a little bit thicker than the ones in CA. The decor of the dining room in NYC is wonderful and one of the largest seating areas in the city. (For those of you that were here in the late 1990's this was the location of MARS 2112 an amazing tourist themed space dining experience. Step into a UFO and you were immediately transported to Mars.) I enjoy the open kitchen where you can see the dumplings being hand made. All locations are very popular. You will need a reservation or at least be on the waitlist. If you are alone and the restaurant is not over crowded sitting at the bar is always an option. We went at lunch time and were seated immediately. The hostess and the server were very friendly and we were given a complimentary tea at the end of our meal. I was very satisfied with the entire experience. I did note that of the different locations the NYC restaurant has little more cooperate clientele even though it is located at the fringe of Times Square. So easy to access from the #1 subway at the 50th Street exit. You must have Din Tai Fun on your culinary bucket list.",13/8/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,5,"Amazing as usual. The perfect spot for soup dumplings. Ambiance is outstanding at the NYC location and since we stayed 5 mins of a walk from the location, it was easy to make reservation and get in. Even though it was a weekday in the afternoon it was pretty packed! Goes to say, this location has been on of the most classiest Ding Tai Fung locations I have been too. 

I was a bit disappointed with the pork bao as i expected it to be a lot more different and better, but sadly it only turned out to be a meatball inside. The classics were the soup  dumplings and the egg fried rice and the chicken spicy wantons. 

We enjoyed the drinks, do try the pear lychee martini and the DTG Old fashioned, just spectacular!",6/5/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,5,"The general restaurant lighting is dark, but it's perfectly adequate at the tables. Drinks were super quick, and the espresso martini was the best I've had anywhere in the city. Our server had some amazing recommendations, but I would say to order on the ""light"" side. Our server recommended three-four items per person, but we could hardly finish two per person. The food is delivered and served ""family style,"" so I also wouldn't recommend doubling up on any items except dessert. All in all, every item that arrived was better than the next, and it was perfectly timed. Perfect photo ops everywhere in the restaurant and in the lobby area. My only ""negative"" comment would be the timing of how the items arrive. Towards the end of our meal, the vegetarian dishes finally arrived; this left some at the table without food while plate upon plate of food arrived for others. This was likely an oversight or a miscommunication, and it would not deter us from a future visit.",14/8/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,Okay came to this restaurant from all the hype. I came on a Monday at 4pm and it was pretty packed.When you make reservations please note that you stand on a line to check in and all your party must be here. They then give you a buzzer and you wait to be called to get seated. Now for the food.I must say the freshly made dumplings are great the soup dumplings the taro dumplings I really enjoyed.  The green beans were great. The bok choy was too bland for me no flavor. The fried rice both shrimp and then chicken was excellent made up for the lack of flavor from the bok choy. The lychee martini was great. The ribs was good. The service was good and the atmosphere was really nice.,30/6/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"Was so excited for this to finally open up here on the East Coast after only having it when venturing out West. Word of caution, it is DIFFICULT to get a reservation at a typical lunch or dinner time even during the week. Weekend evenings seem almost impossible to get, so I haven't even tried to venture out to that.

Service is generally good, but I will say it doesn't quite stack up to the California locations I've been to. Had my order wrong a couple times on top of extremely delayed wait times, however they were willing to make up for it so I do want to recognize that. I will say though I wish they brought out drinks earlier, seems typical for to bring out drinks and then followed immediately by your first couple of items.

Food items typically come out one after the other. It's DTF so you aren't going to go wrong with the quality as everything is made fresh. This location even lets you see the chefs in the kitchen rolling the dough and filling from a large window. Xiaolongbao is what they are famous for, but my favorite is and always will be the dessert. I really come for that alone. It's always worth getting the sweet cream with it.

I'll always be back when I'm in the city, glad to finally have this at least somewhat accessible now.",6/7/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,5,"Anytime I am in a city with Din Tai, it is my first stop. Service at the NYC location was great. I loved that they paced my order to allow me time to eat slowly. This location is huge and nicely designed. The location is central and only a few blocks from Times Square. 

The green beans, spicy noodles, spicy chicken wontons and pear lychee martini were a 10/10.",17/4/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,5,"I have to say, upon traveling to New York I was most excited to try Din Tai Fung. 

We had a reservation and they were able to get us sat immediately in a side room that had great ambiance.  The rest of the restaurant was quite crowded, so I appreciated being sat adjacent to the crowds in the side room. 

We came as a party of 4 and ordered 8 dishes.  The waitress explained that they recommend 2 dishes per person.  

We ordered the String Beans with Garlic, Cucumber Salad, Sweet and Sour Pork Baby Back Ribs, Pork Xiao Long Bao, Chicken Spicy Wontons, Noodles with Spicy Sauce, Chicken Fried Rice, and the Chocolate and Mochi Xiao Long Bao with the side of Foam. 

Everything was absolutely DELICIOUS. There is no shortage of great food in NYC but we made the right decision in coming here. 

Will definitely be back on my next trip. 

P.S. get an extra order of the Chocolate Xiao Long Bao with the side of Foam, you'll want it.",10/4/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"Absolutely loved the cucumber salad, green beans with garlic and the shrimp & pork spicy wontons. However the winner was definitely the dessert, it was so delicious. You have to get the cold foam with it! The Chicken Xiao Long Bao were just ok in my opinion, didn't taste super flavorful and the soup wasn't that hot. One disappointment was that they were out of the black sesame espresso martini that we wanted to try that's an nyc exclusive item, but will have to just go back for that! I also really loved the layout of the restaurant and the ambiance.",29/6/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,5,"Finally made it to Din Tai Fung in New York! We tried the pepper beef, xiao long bao (soup dumplings), wonton soup, cucumber salad, soy noodles, Taiwanese cabbage and clear beef soup. The soup dumplings were definitely the highlight--so good. The pepper beef was tasty but a little milder than I expected. The wonton soup and clear beef soup were light and comforting, and the cucumber and soy noodles were fresh and flavorful. Overall, a great spot and I'd come back just for the dumplings.",16/8/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,5,"Big dim sum fan here! And very experienced in the NYC area dim sum scene. This place was so delicious and delightful. We had pork soup dumplings, potstickers, pork buns, and rice shu mai. Potstickers were good but not too interesting. Soup dumplings were fresh, with thin skins and tasty broth. Pork buns were nicely steamed with a good bun to meat ratio. By far, the rice shu mai were my favorite - perfectly cooked and excellent flavor combination!! Those I could order every day and be happy. But fortunately for my body, it is a rare treat. 100% would and will go again. A little pricey compared to in Chinatown but really nice for midtown.

You can make reservations online. But if you don't and end up sitting at the bar, don't fret. Ask for Brandon if he's working then and he will take excellent care of you. And if he's not there, the others were very nice too. 

Be sure to turn around while you're in the restaurant because towards the back, there's a big clear window where you can see all the chefs, busy folding and making all the dumplings and noodles .

Sadly, no pics for you today. Everything was too delicious.",28/6/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,3,"My experience at Din Tai Fung was a mixed bag overall. As a vegetarian, I did find that there were enough options to have a meal that was filling. I went here for my birthday dinner, and we ordered a bunch of items. Our favorites were the cucumber salad, vegan spicy wontons, and our dessert, the chocolate and mochi xiao long bao with sea salt cream. Tbh I would mainly come back for this dessert, the other food was not all that worth coming back for.

I would say my biggest negative on this restaurant is the service. First, you have to order your items on a paper and it isn't very personal with your server since different people take the paper and bring you your food. My fiancé mentioned that it was my birthday and the server rudely said ""we don't do anything for birthdays"". We didn't even mention it for that reason, and it was very off-putting. The ambiance overall is nice, but this type of service took away from it. I hope that this can be addressed in the future and other customers don't have to experience such issues.",1/4/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"Din Tai Fung is a decent pick if you're in the heart of Times Square, looking for place you can talk with your party and not sit on top of another table.  It's a huge restaurant and is 1 block away from Stardust Diner.

The food here is, overall, pretty good. It definitely is on the more expensive side for Chinese food in NYC - but this is Times Square and Din Tai Fung's first NYC location. We didn't get any pork dishes because one of us is pescatarian, and we didn't feel like we missed anything.

Highlights are: 
-the vegan dumplings spicy sauce (I can just drink that all day, though I think the sauce is used in many dishes
-chocolate mocha xiao long bao - a must have dish
-string beans - pretty good as well. Not the best you'll have in NYC but still good nonetheless

We had a show to go to after dinner and told our waitress that we had to rush. She was great in getting our food ordered and making sure we got all of our dishes in time. She checked in with us and I enjoyed the service!

My one gripe with the restaurant was the music selection. The restaurant looks like a really sleek place - kind of like a Hutong. You can tell there was a lot of thought into the interior design, the wallpaper, the place setting, etc. But the music was off the night we went - kind of reminds me of listening to a Christian rock type of radio station on a long road trip when you're in the middle of nowhere and you didn't plan on listening to it. 

Otherwise, we could suggest coming here. Just don't expect the best best Chinese food and expect to pay a bit more for dumplings.",12/4/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"Good service, good food, very busy. Never expected their cucumber salad to be so crisp and delicious. String beans with garlic were an absolute perfection. Kurobuta pork soup dumplings were quite tasty, didn't really like sticky rice Shao Mai with mushrooms- tasted bizarre. Pork buns were simply okay, too much dough; however great flavors in the chicken wonton soup, as well as the noodles with spicy sauce. Chocolate buns for dessert looked cool, but tasted very ordinary. 
Was it phenomenal and worth waiting for a reservation for weeks ? No. But it was a good meal.",12/4/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,3,This restaurant is beautiful and you wouldn't expect how big is from the outside. The food was not as impressive. The cucumber salad had a nice crunch but bland. The shrimp and pork xiao long baos were juicy but nothing I haven't had before. The chili wontons were a little sweet and not really spicy. Chocolate mochi xiao long baos were warm and chocolately. I expected the skin to be more chewy like mochi but it just seemed like regular wonton skins. There's an option to get sea salt cream on the side which I think helped balance the chocolate. Servicer was friendly and took time to answer any questions. The food was fine but for the price it's not worth another visit.,25/6/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,5,"One of my favorite restaurants in SoCal. This place has THE best xiao long bao. I had the pork xiao long bao which had thin skin and delicious soup inside the dumplings. The rice cakes with kurobata pork were good too. I liked the glass noodle bean curd appetizer too which is refreshing. We also got the beef noodle soup which was delicious and not too spicy! I made a reservation beforehand. It's a nice restaurant, not too fancy, but not casual.",25/6/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"Went here for lunch.  What fancy interior!  I've been to Din Tai Fung - the original one in the US in Arcadia.  That place, you went for the food, not for the decor.  Somehow the fancy decor doesn't quite fit with the type of food they are serving.  I not complaining, mind you, but the place seems a little too fancy for humble dumplings.

Having said that the food is pretty good, although honestly not as good as the Arcadia location.  XLB did not have enough soup inside the dumplings, which was a bit disappointing.  

I personally think plain pork ones are better than the crab and pork but others at the table liked the crab and pork ones better.  Dumplings in chili oil was excellent.  Would recommend this item along with XLB.  We also tried sesame noodles, dan dan noodles, and Shanghai rice cakes.  All were okay but stick with dumplings.

For other dishes, we tried cucumbers, woodear mushrooms, sautéed green beans, and wok choi.  They all paired very well with the dumplings and so I would recommend.

Finally, service was efficient and they paced the food for us so that we didn't just get all our order at our table at once.

I would recommend, especially if you are into nice modern dining decor to go along with your dumplings.",24/6/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"I came here for lunch last Thursday with my team- there were 10 of us in total. I'm the only Asian in the group and I actually grew up in Taiwan, so I was really excited to introduce everyone to Din Tai Fung. Thankfully, the food and vibe totally lived up to the hype! 
Everyone loved it, and a few coworkers even said they want to bring our business partners here next time.

That said, the reservation system was a bit of a headache. They only accept online reservation , but you can only book for up to 6 people online. If you have more than 6 people , you're forced to make two separate reservations--but here's the catch: the system won't let you do that using the same name, phone number, email, or even credit card. It flags it and rejects the second booking, which was super frustrating.

I emailed their booking team to ask how to reserve for 10 people, and they basically sent a standard response suggesting we book a private room... for $1,400. And that doesn't include food or drinks. I get it--it's Midtown NYC--but honestly, who's paying $1,400 just for a room for lunch?

In the end, we managed to make it work, and we really enjoyed the food and service. It's a great spot and I'd totally recommend it--but I really hope they update their reservation system to make it easier for larger groups.",16/6/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"I finally made my way to Din Tai Fung, and while some dishes lived up to the hype, others left me wanting more. Here's my breakdown for one of  the hardest restaurant to get into:

Chicken Soup Dumplings - 4/10
These were disappointing. Tiny, with barely any soup inside. If you're craving real soup dumplings, I'd recommend hitting up a hole-in-the-wall spot in Chinatown or Flushing instead.

Spicy Pork Wontons - 8/10
Pleasantly surprised! I've had better, but these were still solid. I went in with sky-high expectations thanks to social media, but while they weren't a perfect 10, they were definitely worth ordering.

Spicy Noodles - 8/10
A simple but tasty dish. Not very spicy on its own, but pro tip: save the sauce from the spicy pork wontons and mix it in--it takes the noodles to another level. Also, if you like a real kick, mention your spice preference when ordering.

Garlic String Beans - 10/10
Easily the best side dish on the table. Perfectly cooked, crunchy, and loaded with flavor without being overly garlicky. I'd come back just for these.

Spicy Cucumbers - 9/10
A great balance of spicy and sweet. I make these at home often, and while these weren't mind-blowing, they were definitely a refreshing and shareable starter.

Chocolate Xiao Long Bao - 10/10
The absolute star of the meal! Warm, gooey dark chocolate inside a soft bun--it was pure indulgence. I don't even love dark chocolate, but this wasn't bitter at all. Pro tip: Add the sea salt cream for $3. It's worth every penny.

Honey Lemonade - 10/10
Light, refreshing, and even better with boba. A great way to balance out all the bold flavors.

Would I go back? Yes! But next time, I'm going for the fried rice and baby back ribs--I saw them pass by, and my mouth was watering.

Overall, a good experience, the waitstaff and hostess was sweet and very attentive. But if you're a hardcore soup dumpling fan, you might want to set your expectations accordingly.",21/3/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,5,"Wow. Been wanting to eat here so badly over the years, and I'm so glad I finally did. The hype is real and I've been thinking about this meal ever since. Truly unexplainable, delicious, memorable, and amazing. There aren't enough adjectives to describe this meal. It's a must try with a huge menu; something for everyone! The service is incredible and the food comes out so quickly.",15/6/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,3,Beautiful place. Great service. Food was okay. Seems overhyped. There are better soup dumplings elsewhere in the city.,7/8/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"I hate to say but this was slightly underwhelming. Everyone knows how popular Din Tai Fung has gotten so of course I had to make a reservation while in the city. We snagged a lunch reservation on a Friday and this restaurant is massive! We got seated after waiting maybe 10 minutes and our server came around pretty quick after. One of our friends had a garlic and onion allergy (I know, I know) BUT they were super accommodating and every plate that got delivered they told us if it had garlic or onion in it. 

I think my favorite dishes were the garlic green beans and cucumber salad. The dumplings were good but honestly, the Trader Joe's soup dumplings taste pretty similar to these. Which is still good! Just not blown away by it. I feel like the prices were fair and I loved how you could watch them make all of the dumplings. The chocolate dumplings were seriously to die for so those are a must if you make this a stop!",3/4/2025,Food & Beverage

Din Tai Fung,5,"Just go. That's it. Listen to the hype, believe the TikToks, dive into the chatter about this place because it 100% lives up to the hype.

The last time I went to Din Tai Fung was in Seattle years ago and I was itching to go again during my NYC trip. Definitely make a reservation since they are reservation-only - I made one around 1 month in advance through Yelp.

The food, service, and ambiance are spectacular. The food is literally made in front of you in their open kitchen and you can definitely tell it's all ""homemade"". They have the best xiao long bao, spicy wontons, noodles, green beans, teas, drinks, and desserts. EVERYTHING was a hit, literally everything. I have nothing bad to say. Just go!!!!!",14/3/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,5,"Ambiance is great, service is great. Usually start off with the cucumber salad. You can't go wrong with any of the dumplings or the wontons. If you can handle spice, definitely get any of the spicy variations. The spicy noodles are fantastic as well. Save room for the chocolate long bao. A favorite place of mine",18/8/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,5,"Chocolate bao underneath Times Square?! 

At first we couldn't find it, note: it is underground! We went down the stairs and checked in and were sat within a few mins at our table. Definitely make a reservation! 

We tried a lot but our favorite were the spicy noodles and the xlb. Whatever you do, do not miss the chocolate xlb with the sea salt cream. 

Our waitress Lieve created a positive dining experience for us and we will definitely be back. The space was massive with a classy yet not over-the-top vibe. We couldn't stop thinking about how we were under Times Square!",20/7/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"I tried DTF in Las Vegas about 4 years ago and I knew I wanted to try the NY location. I made a reservation 1 month in advance. We ordered the following:

cucumbers: 3/10 extremely overhyped, it's $9 for one mini cucumber lol I make better cucumber salad at home. I guess it's fine to try once to see the hype. Only ordered because we were with people who haven't tried. 

garlic green beans: 4/10 nothing too special could use a bit more seasoning

crab and Kurobuta pork soup dumplings: 8/10 pretty good but nothing too crazy

chicken chili oil wontons: 8/10 ^

chocolate dumplings sea salt sauce: 100/10 omg my favorite dessert, I've been thinking about it since I had it last time, with the sea salt cream is even better

Green tea with salt cream: 10/10 the perfect drink! not too sweet

Service was pretty good; our waiter was attentive, and food came out pretty quickly. I would recommend the dumplings/wontons foodwise and the desserts and beverages. I would still return it was a good experience I would just not order as many veggies.",12/3/2025,Food & Beverage

I will say, the quality at DTF seems to have dropped since my first few meals but it is still good. The place was buzzing on a week day with lots of people dining and and ordering take out. Of course you need to get some XLBs. Don't forget the green beans and fried rices. Service was very friendly and attentive. Large underground space with vibrant dining room and bar. Might be touristy but oh well, I'd still go back!",10/6/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,5,"Beautiful venue on the corner of 50th and Broadway.  Checked in at 4:28 and got seated at 4:36.  

Our order:
1. Chicken Spicy Wonton:  Beautiful flavor.  Spice was there, but not overwhelming. 
2. Pork XLB:  Loved these.  Nothing overwhelming.  Lovely flavor and the soup inside was the perfect temperature.  
3. Kimchi and Kurobuta pork dumpling:  Good, but not a lot of flavor. We dipped them in the spicy wonton sauce and that gave them a little extra kick.  
4. Pork buns: Best nap bun I've ever had.  The buns aren't sweet at all and the pork inside was seasoned perfectly.  
5. Sticky Rice Shao Mai with Kurobuta pork and Mushroom:  An earthier flavor due to the mushrooms, but I loved it.  

First dish came out quickly and they served one more dish at a time about every three minutes.  It was too fast for us.  We felt very rushed and the table became cluttered with dishes.  I would've liked to enjoy each dish without feeling like I needed to move on.  That said, we loved it and will do it again.",18/3/2025,Food & Beverage

Having said that, food is still of a high quality. I would teally just focus on cucumbers and soup dumplings.
Pork soup dumplings where perfect together with their signature cucumbers and noodles, wonton and string beans.
Ended up ordering a bunch since we were fine to have leftovers home.
Didn't like the crab soup dumplings... taste was way too strong, too fishy not reminding me crab at all.
The regular pork buns were good and worth it.
Felt that fried rice was kind of plain but good since it was more a side for us.
Amazing surprise on the string beans- so good
As well as the noodles!! Loved them",15/3/2025,Food & Beverage

We ordered pork ribs, sample of soup dumplings, green beans & spicy wonton - not a bad dish, all well executed! 
Teens (seated separately) also loved the choco dumplings dessert.

Din Tai Fung,5,"When entering you look at if you aren't entering a restaurant, then you take the staircase to the lower level where you see the restaurant in kind of a darker moody vibe. They have a reservation line or a walk in line. We went to the walk in line and they immediately sat us at the bar. I was very impressed with how clean the bar was, all the servers looked clean and tidy as well. We ordered dishes and split them, I thought the food was delicious, my only gripe was I with the soup dumplings actually had more broth in them. Other than that everything was great even the price I thought was on the lower end for NYC. This restaurant was huge- even rooms off to the side were having business meetings. My favorite part was seeing them, through the glass, making the noodles! I would come back here in a heartbeat especially for the cucumber salad.",29/5/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,5,"An upscale outpost of the classic dim sum spot -- I've been to locations all over the world, and this one is one of the largest. I appreciate that there are vegan versions of most, if not all, things -- personal favorites include Spicy Wontons, Sesame Noodles and Shrimp Fried Rice. The Milk Tea was watery... would skip it. The servers are attentive and the food came out quickly -- they're a well-oiled machine. I'd come back to try the cocktails, which I've heard are quite good!",5/6/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"I made a reservation 2 weeks in advance and was sat within 10 minute's. I really enjoyed the black pepper steak and the noodles with sesame sauc both were flavorful and satisfying. The cucumber salad was refreshing, though nothing special. Soup dumplings were just okay, I've  had better elsewhere they weren't that hot. Service was a bit slow (drinks took about 30 minutes), but overall the experience was good enough that I'd come back to try more dishes.",5/6/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"Food was superb. All of it seemed to be WAY MORE flavorful than other West Coast locations we've been to. We had our usual: Steamed Stringbeans, Kale & Garlic and Spinach with Garlic, Chicken Xiao Long Bao, Spicy Chicken Wonton, Chicken and Shrimp Fried Rice (separately).

A few Service issues and solutions/accommodations varied between our Servers, along with the cadence of food, which took FOREVER. Others seated approximately 30-40 mins. AFTER us had their food long before us.

We enjoyed a few rounds of Lychee Martinis and Old Fashions. Both pretty good. 

Overall, definitely a place for celebrating life! Thankfully, they have started their Take Out Service for those of us who still wanna eat well while on the move!",23/2/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,3,"3 star to 3.5
Finally got the chance to come here for lunch after hearing so many good claims about it (""best xiao long baos in the world""). This is my honest review and what we ordered. We ordered Crab Xiao Long Bao, regular pork xiao long bao(XLB), string beans with garlic, and sweet and sour baby back pork ribs, dessert: chocolate mochi XLB with sea salt cream.

The baby back pork ribs were pretty tasty. They were tender and had a slightly smoky taste which is well incorporated. (4/5)

The string beans with garlic were done perfectly. Exactly the right texture (from blanching) and then stir-frying. (5/5)

Finally, the xiao long bao. Overall, they were.......underwhelming. Both crab and regular tasted a bit bland with little seasoning/marination for the filling. The only redeeming factor was the thin yet plyable dumpling skin. They nailed the dumpling skin almost perfectly in any ideal XLB. However, the XLB, as a whole, pales in comparison to shanghainese style XLB (Din Tai Fung is a Taiwanese-influenced version). The flavor is not there. The soup is not there (literally not there, 5ml per dumpling). 
Crab (3/5), Regular (2/5)

Dessert: (2.5/5) chocolate filling XLB. Tastes exactly how it looks and sounds nothing special or great.

Overall, it was kind of disappointing. I can definitely say, this is not even close to the ""best soup dumplings in the world"". I would rank this somewhere in the middle. The filling fell flat and sad, no love, no soul, just a wasted piece of pork (basically boiled with some salt). I really wanted to like this place and I was very hungry before eating here. Unfortunately, this was exactly as I suspected it would be: overhyped. Servers were nice and professional.",9/3/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,3,"Finally had the chance to try Din Tai Fung. We had to make reservations 2 weeks in advance due to this place taking reservations only. 
We were impressed with the interior of this place. Very cozy and welcoming. You are also able to watch the kitchen staff prep the XLB through glass windows which was a very cool experience. Our server was attentive and gave recommendations which was appreciated.
The sweet & sour pork baby back ribs were delish. So were the garlicky green beans. Wish I ordered a side of rice to enjoy them with (personal preference)
The XLB were paper thin. Very fun to try. We dipped it in the shoyu, vinegar and ginger mix before eating. 
The Chocolate & Mochi Xiao Long Bao with a side of salted cream was heavenly. If you like chocolate, you will be sure to enjoy it.",9/3/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"Came here tonight for dinner. The restaurant was very large, but the decor was very nice. You must make a reservation if you want to eat dinner at a reasonable hour. It was packed for a Tuesday night. Our main waiter was Nico and he was very pleasant and helped us decide which plates to choose.

We were given an ordering slip where we wrote down the number of each we wanted. We got the popular pork xiao long bao. It was small and the broth inside was a room temperature. Our other dishes were pretty good. The plates would come out as they were ready. There was no order that it was going in and it was always a different waiter giving us our plate. For dessert, we ordered the chocolate mochi with salt cream foam. The chocolate inside was warm but the dough was not the typical mochi dough I was expecting. It was the same dough that was used to make the soup dumplings. The foam added some saltiness to cut the sweetness of the chocolate but truthfully it was probably not needed. I am not sure I would come back here again.",18/2/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,5,"DTF has a special place in my heart since I have such great memories eating at the OG in Taipei many years ago as a teenager. So far every outpost outside of Taiwan has been really disappointing for me. London - bleh, Shanghai - meh. NYC though got it right. This location is pretty darn close to the taste and quality of the Taipei locations. 

First and foremost, this must be the nicest DTF I've ever been in. They spared no expense and the decor is high end. In terms of food, everything met the high standard I'm used to eating at their Taipei locations with the best items being of course the original soup dumplings but the dessert baos are sneaky good. Red bean with mochi is a great way to end the meal and the chocolate soup dumplings were a hit with the family. Service here was great and our food came out quickly. Price is what you'd expect for a big name franchise opening its first location in NY. Thumbs up.",16/2/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"Very solid Taiwanese soup dumplings. They are smaller than the Shanghainese variety found at Joe's and packed with more crabmeat (I highly recommend getting that version). 

The other dishes such as the chili wontons, shumai, and pork chop rice are also solid. The shumai is more like a wonton in that the shrimp and pork are in separate layers and the pork chop is grilled, not fried. 

The service is just okay - not super attentive and we had to remind them to get 2 items which were forgotten. 

4 stars for the food and 3 for the service but will round to a 4.",13/2/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,5,"If you've been around here long enough, you already know I have a serious crush on Din Tai Fung. Tokyo stole my heart first, then San Diego kept the spark alive, and now--hello, New York.

On a recent quick trip to the city with my friend Alex, I had just one day, one Broadway show, and one mission: get to Din Tai Fung at all costs. I made a reservation for 1:15 PM like the responsible adult I pretend to be, but then the day unraveled faster than a Chinatown knockoff purse. We missed the 15-minute grace window, and I thought the dumpling dream was over.

But never underestimate my determination (or my pleading skills). After our show, we sprinted to Din Tai Fung's new location inside the Shops at Columbus Circle. Yes, it's their first East Coast spot, and it's massive. When we arrived, I went straight to the host stand and met Haya, who instantly restored my faith in humanity. I explained our tragic missed reservation, and she smiled like someone who's seen it all. She popped us on the waitlist and directed us to the bar. Each interaction with her was wonderful.  She easily made conversation and genuinely looked like she enjoys her job .

At the bar, I ordered my go-to: the Pear Lychee Martini. It's sweet, refreshing, and sneaky--exactly how I like my drinks. One drink in and boom, our table was ready. Just like that. Dumpling destiny, baby.

Naturally, I wasted no time and ordered two baskets of the Kurobuta Pork Xiao Long Bao. These little soup bombs never miss. The wrapper is thin and delicate, the broth is flavorful, and the temperature is perfectly ready-to-eat (no lip-scorching here). I don't know how they do it, but I don't ask questions. I just eat.

Now, let's talk about the Great Soup Dumpling Debate. Alex followed the ""proper"" technique: place the dumpling on a spoon, poke it open, sip the soup, then bite. I, on the other hand, am more of a thrill-seeker. I pop the whole thing in my mouth like I'm defusing a delicious bomb. We agreed to disagree and ordered another round.

Final thoughts: Din Tai Fung is now officially a non-negotiable part of my NYC (and California) routine. The food is consistent, the service is kind, and the dumplings are borderline emotional support-worthy.

Din Tai Fung,2,"Ambiance was nice but dark since the NYC location is in the basement. There was a wait still even though we had a reservation made a month ahead. Dim sum was just ok & pricey. Better in Flushing! It was an experience since we heard great reviews but will not come back, unfortunately! A little disappointed",22/8/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,5,"I was here for my sister's birthday celebration, it was a wonderful experience to say the least.
We were treated at front by Nevaeh, who was so pleasant and nice. She took care of everything for us, we didn't even have to wait for too long, by the time we were done taking pictures in the beautiful decor we were up for table right next to kitchen window. It was a cherry on top. Food was of the top, I've tried quite a bit of dumplings from around the world but the experience here made it even better. I'm so grateful to such a wonderful experience, thank you Nevaeh, I hope her sincerity and pleasant attitude will allow others to enjoy the same experience at Din Tai Fung like my family had. 
Thank you",16/8/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,5,"So happy to have snagged a reservation for this location. Been to one outpost in Taipei (not the original) and it was phenomenal.  Hoping to have the same magic replicated here.  

This location is larger, with a more upscale feeling (love the walk down).  Checking in is seamless with a pager. Separate waiting areas exist (part with those with pagers, another section for those whose pagers have gone off).

Food menu is in a laminated large sheet. Drink menu is in a separate black booklet.  A paper menu inventory sheet is also included for the customer to check off order items. Waitstaff will read it and confirm before sending to the kitchen. 

We shared the vegan spicy noodles, vegan wontons in spicy sauce and cod fish steamed dumplings.  Everything came out perfectly.  The wontons were stuffed with mushrooms, garlic, scallion and bean thread noodles pieces.  The skin was perfectly cooked but still firm enough to hold the filling. The spicy sauce had hints of vinegar, soy and chilis.  

The noodles had perfect chew and were tossed in radish, scallions, chili, vinegar and other spices.  It was tasty.

The star was the steamed dumplings.  They arrived piping hot in a bamboo steamer.  The filling was juicy and fish was very fresh.  Each dumpling was a nice crescent shape with a set # of folds.  Wonderful dining experience, will come back again!",2/3/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"Get the crab xiao long bao and the pork chop fried rice! The crab ones have a strong crab flavor and are full of umami. The soup dumplings have a thin wrapper layer and are packed with soup. For the sauce, I recommend using more vinegar and eating each soup dumpling with some ginger to cut the richness. The pork soup dumplings are good as well, but the crab ones are superior. The pork chop fried rice has perfectly cooked pork chop on top of egg fried rice. This was seasoned really well.

Some disappointments were the noodles with sesame sauce and the chocolate xiao long bao. Definitely pass on the noodles with sesame sauce - this is literally noodles with some sesame sauce, it was rather bland and didn't have much depth in flavor. The chocolate xiao long baos came a bit cracked, which was fine, but it was extremely sweet! Even with a sweet tooth, this was way too sweet. They also take over 15 minutes to come out.

We went for the James Jean red envelopes for the lunar new year event, but they were out of envelopes.",29/1/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,5,"I've been eating here for many many years hopefully they'll open in Florida

Din Tai Fung,4,"So glad another vegan-friendly restaurant opened up in midtown for pre or post-Broadway show meals. Din Tai Fung is a great addition. While they don't have a vegan version of their Xiao Long Bao, the soup dumpling that got them famous, they have plenty of other tasty options. 

Hard to pick a favorite but standouts include the spicy wonton, Taiwanese cabbage with garlic, and a recent discovery, the Shanghai rice cakes. This is the type of place where you can't go wrong with any of your choices. The dim sum order form clearly lists the vegan options, making it easy to pick out and order them. If you have any questions, the servers are friendly and knowledgeable. Despite the cavernous dining room they have to cover, they are always nearby. You can even watch the kitchen staff roll the dumplings through a glass window on one side of the floor.

Reservations open a month in advance. Make them as early as possible. This place is packed and popular and for good reason.",1/3/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,5,Best experience and delish food! We pretty much ordered almost one of everything in the menu it's not cheap but it is worth the price. And do not leave without getting the chocolate buns oh my goodness I could've eaten all the creamer that came with it by myself,17/8/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"I finally got to try DTF and am so glad I did. This a such a great spot for large groups. We were dining out for a birthday and were fortunate to get a private room for a party of 8 hassle-free, i.e. no prix-fixe menus or advanced payments required. The restaurant is that popular that the space would easily be scooped up by other patrons if there was a no-show. Thankfully we were all there on-time and the staff was prompt in seating us. It was very interesting walking to our take and watching the glass-window room where all the magic of making the dumplings happens. Everything was on point- the food, the service, and the setting especially our nice semi-private section that had large tv monitors looked like it could be used to hold meetings or convert to a karaoke room. While the soup dumplings were not the best I've ever had, they were freshly made in-house and still juicy and very good. The noodles with sesame sauce and the pork chop fried rice were the winners, favorites of the entire meal. Overall, a positive experience and a must try.",20/7/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,5,"Outstanding Chinese restaurant in NYC. 

Definitely get the Pork Xiao Long Bao. But I thought the truffle version was not worth the cost. Stick with the original pork version!

I night recommend ordering the Sticky Rice Shao Mai with Kurobuta Pork & Mushroom as it is super delicious and far superior to any other Chinese restaurant I have visited. 

In fact, everything g here is excellent including the Shanghai Rice Cakes with shrimp or pork. 

The only bummer here is that this place is still very hard to get reservations unless you plan 30 days in advance. So be warned, if you want to dine here (and you would be crazy to miss this place) you need to plan ahead and book reservations. 

It is a little easier to book bar seating but the tables are more relaxing. This place is huge 120 tables or so but the sell out very fast.",25/1/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,3,"I got here five minutes early to my reservation and was handed a disk to wait for my table. I guess it makes sense because it would be easier to buzz the disk instead of yelling out someone's name but part of me felt annoyed because there was only one other party waiting and they seated them and a party that came in after me, first. Already I was feeling annoyed.... If there isn't a lot of folks waiting, I thought the disk was excessive, unnecessary, and in my part, delayed me getting my table because it looked like a tech issue.

When we were seated, I asked for still water, which comes in a bottle and they gave me tap. Ok... fine, slightly annoyed but I wasn't going to lose my mind over it. Then when they were serving us our food, one of the servers passing by almost knocked over our large bottle of water and my friend got splashed. When they cleared our table for dessert, they didn't replace our spoons for the chocolate XLB, so we had to eat the little buns whole, or spill the chocolate on our plates, which you can see happened to me. Because of that, I wasn't fully able to enjoy my dessert or finish the sea salt foam (like how do you expect me to enjoy foam with chopsticks). Yes - I could have asked for spoons, but this entire experience made me feel like our service was not attentive at all, literally throwing the food at us. 

Abysmal service aside, food was also largely unimpressive. I've been to two Ding Tai Fengs in China and Taiwan, and felt like the quality was not as good in comparison. The XLB were WAY smaller and there was not enough soup in the dumpling, nor did they taste fresh. I was prepared for the soup to burn my tongue, but when I bit into it, it was at room temp, like they've been sitting for a while. The spicy wontons and noodles kind of just tasted the same to me, and was nothing to rave about. The cucumber salad is also massively overhyped-- there are better and larger cucumber salads at local Northern Chinese restaurants. Disappointing. 

The only saving grace of this depressing experience was the chocolate XLB. I love chocolate and having this literally added a star to my review. I was going to leave two stars, but the chocolate XLB was just that awesome. 

100% will probably never come back, unless I could just sit at the bar and have the chocolate XLB.",26/2/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,5,"Reliably delicious, warm and inviting ambiance! This location is especially huge; walking in, the restaurant seems to go on forever.

All the food is pretty standard to all Din Tai Fung locations. The string beans were very yummy and garlicky. The chocolate xlb pleasantly surprised me! It was like a pop of chocolately fudge. Overall, very solid choice for a dinner out!",25/1/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"Ambiance and decor was still the same. However I didnt find the food matched the upcharge. I've been to better DTFs in Seattle, Bellevue, Shanghai, Taiwan that were much better and cheaper. You get what you pay for I suppose in a city like Manhattan.

Still love DTF, but would probably skip this one again.",24/8/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"Compared to all the soup dumplings and Taiwanese street food dishes in NYC, Din Tai Fung stands out as the best. The flavors are quite close to authentic Taiwanese cuisine, bringing a sense of nostalgia for those familiar with the taste.

That said, it's not the same as Din Tai Fung in Taipei. The soup dumpling wrappers, as well as those for wontons and other dumplings, are noticeably thicker and less delicate than Din Tai Fung in Taiwan and Japan. The signature 18 folds on the soup dumplings are not consistent, and the tops are too thick. Watching the chefs in the open kitchen, it's clear that their technique doesn't match the skill level seen in Taiwan.

Among all the dishes we tried, the standout was the sweet and sour baby ribs, which had an authentic flavor and texture. The beef noodle soup was surprisingly good, and the sesame noodles were quite close to the Taiwanese style. While it's understandable that exact replication in a foreign setting is difficult--and the flavors may have been adjusted to suit American preferences--we're just happy to have a place where we can enjoy these familiar street food flavors.",21/2/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"This place is huge. A lot bigger than I expected. It sits in the old space of Mars 2112 for those that remember. We had a 2:15 reservation and checked in but still had to wait another 15 minutes. Not ideal. 

Once we sat, we ordered by checking off the items on the menu sheet. We ordered the pork soup dumplings, cucumber, hot and sour soup, potstickers, beef tenderloin, garlic string beans, spicy wontons, pork chop fried rice, and chocolate dumplings. 

The food was quite good. The soup dumplings aren't as good as I remembered them. The first batch lacked soup. The second batch was much better but still not my favorite. 

The highlights were the string beans, the wontons, hot and sour soup, beef tenderloin, and chocolate dumplings. The main issue with the food here is that it's served almost like it's coursed out when Chinese food should be eaten all together. So basically we were eating string beans by itself, then the fried rice by itself, and then the beef by itself. When they really should've all came out at once so that I can eat them together.

I'll probably come back but not order the soup dumplings next time.",26/1/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,3,"Fun spot but the food was definitely over priced. I definitely understand the appeal as the ambiance and service is very beautiful/attentive, but the dishes were not all that impressive in terms of dimsum choices. Loved the chocolate buns",12/5/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"I've been to DinTai Fung before in Taiwan, so I have some frame of reference to which to compare this one. First, this place was massive. You walk downstairs and you immediately see a huge dining area was this kind of fancy date night ambiance. 

You need a reservation to be seated, after checking in it took about 10 min for us to be seated. The wait staff is very kind and they check many things like if you have allergies, what order you want the dishes to come out, etc... The wait time for the food was longer than average, but given how many people were inside I can kind of understand if it takes a bit longer. 

The food itself was pretty standard for Din Tai Fung, which is a bit better than average. Din Tai Fun does the fundamentals really well, they don't really use gimmicks and rely on ingredients and preparation to serve you a good dish. Eating at Din Tai Fun feels clean if that makes sense. 

Everything we ordered was pretty good, the only thing I kind of regretted getting was the chocolate xiao long bao. Don't listen to anyone who tells you this is amazing, do yourself a favor and just buy Nutella and some dumpling wrap.",27/1/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"LOVE LOVE LOVE Din Tai Fung! This was my wife and I's first time at the NYC location. We have been to one in London and one in San Francisco as well. We made a reservation for this one ahead of time, and it was a good thing we did, because the place was PACKED. This location is also massive too. There are numerous tables scattered throughout the entire establishment. We get what we normally get at Din Tai Fung. We got the spicy chicken wontons, the noodles w/ spicy sauce, the pork xiao long bao, the string beans, the cucumber salad, and the cucumber salad. Everything tasted SO GOOD. I got a Yuzu Margarita to drink and my wife got a gin and tonic. I ended the dinner with an espresso martini, which was very good. The food at Din Tai Fung is always consistent, no matter what location you go to, which I love. The ambiance of this particular location was really nice too. Low lighting mixed with the hustle and bustle of the business makes this place a great spot for a date night. The only reason why I am not giving this 5 stars, is because the service was very very very slow. I do understand it was busy, but it took 20 minutes for my coke to come out. But our waiter was very nice and did apologize, so no huge deal. I would definitely come back here again!! Wish I was going here for dinner tonight!",24/7/2025,Food & Beverage

Din Tai Fung,5,"Ahhh we meet again my lovely DTF - we've had it in Singapore and LA and have been anxiously waiting for the NYC location to finally open! The biggest one in the world. 

Nomz: We ordered the following for two and it was enough food, one of us eats a good amount and the other a normal amount. Two orders of the pork soup dumplings (I mean we came for these) - I do feel like they were soupier at other locations but the silver lining is that you can just eat it in one bite versus puncturing it and sipping. Yummm. 
Also, ordered the shrimp and pork spicy wontons, delicious. 
Surprise of the night were the green beans, they were so freaking flavorful and addicting, I still think about them sometimes. 

Drinks: Had the cucumber gimlet and it was very nice and refreshing - would order again. 

Service: Was very good, everyone was super attentive and there were a lot of people working there - it's a whole operation. 

Ambiance: It's underground, we were given a pager and had to wait even with a reservation once we got there. The dining room is elegant, on your way to the restroom your will find their classic glass area where you can see them making the famous Xiao Long Bao.

Nope or Dope: Dope, I mean come on - it's an instant classic - can't wait until I go back.",17/1/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,4,"This place is absolutely massive and I don't know how they manage to operate everything. It's honestly impressive. 

Depending on the time you go, even if you have a reservation, you may expect to wait a bit before being seated. But they have a nice waiting area so that makes it a little better. 

It's so easy to order so much food here, and honestly, you should. Everything I've tried has been incredible, and for a pescatarian like me, them having the veggie options for dumpling and spicy wontons is so wonderful.

I first visited Din Tai Fung at the Seattle location and enjoyed it so much. So glad this place opened in NYC, it's also the world's largest location. The ambiance is really pretty and upscale.

Din Tai Fung,4,"I first dined at Din Tai Fung shortly after its NYC opening in July, when securing a reservation was nearly impossible, and the hype around it was intense. 

At the time, the food lived up to the buzz with standout dishes like the shrimp wontons, noodles with spicy sauce, and the Sesame & Mochi Xiao Long Bao. 

However, I did find the pork xiao long bao to be just okay,,, the flavor wasn't fully there, and the portions were smaller than expected for the price. Maybe it was due to it being the first week of opening, so I'm definitely open to giving it another try. 

This restaurant is HUGE! You can come with groups, sit at the bar, or even come solo because the space allows it. I really think it's cool you get to see the dumplings being made, it's definitely an experience. 

Now getting a table is much easier with reservations available via here on Yelp or walk-ins. Despite my preference of soup dumplings, Din Tai Fung remains a must-visit for anyone who loves Taiwanese cuisine its worth the trip.",2/1/2025,Food & Beverage
Din Tai Fung,1,"I ordered takeout and was excited due to all the positive reviews and reputation that this brand has. I was utterly disappointed. Maybe it would have been better in the restaurant but when I received my pork soup dumplings and rice cakes with shrimp they were lukewarm, borderline cold. The soup dumplings were incredibly small, the smallest I've ever seen at a restaurant (even trader joes box soup dumplings are bigger) but sure at least they give you 10 dumplings in an order. The flavor was relatively bland and there was no depth at all. There was also no sauce so I ate my soup dumplings dry. The rice cakes were ok but also not the best I've had. I paid an incredulous amount for food that was not worth the price and was not filling in the slightest. This place is definitely overhyped, especially from a takeout perspective.",20/7/2025,Food & Beverage

My friend and I took advantage of their weekday lunch special (runs from 11:30 am-3:30 pm), which affords you a $16-19 main dish (pho, banh mi, or noodle/rice dish), accompanied by a salad or soup. For a restaurant like this where dinner entrees run for $21-43, this is a fantastic deal. The portions were excellently sized, and our dishes were  really tasty. My friend also got Vietnamese iced coffee and it was giant. They have the full range of beer, wine, fancier cocktails, and a robust list of non-alcoholic options, so there's something for everyone.

The menu features a great selection of appetizers, highly recommend the spring rolls, they were fresh and flavorful. For dessert, the coconut ice cream really stood out. It was creamy, rich, and honestly better than what you'd find at many dedicated ice cream shops.

-steamed fried rice: this is unique. Each tiny dish has a piece of rice cake at the bottom of the toppings. You add the dipping sauce to the tiny dishes and use a spoon to scoop it up to eat. 
-bun cha Hanoi: this reminds me of other Vietnamese vermicelli dishes I've had in the past but the presentation of this dish is cool. It was also fun to construct your own wraps with the veggies, vermicelli, and meat. 
-crab fried rice: a good balance of crab meat and rice, a stable dish that you can't go wrong with.

La Dong,4,"NYC lacks good vietnamese food... so was super excited to hear that La Dong opened up! While not the best Vietnamese food I have ever had, it is pretty good for NYC standards. Service is super fast and it is also easy to get a last minute res here :) 

- spring rolls (3/5): not super impressed by this. looked better in other photos I saw online (I wish the texture was a bit more like a nest), so maybe today was an off day for this dish. 

- papaya salad (2.5/5): not terrific papaya salad either. I would opt into one of the other salads

- banh mi (4.2/5): this was my favorite dish of the night! they were able to cut it into 4 pieces for the 4 of us and the truffle broth was heavenly. the ingredients inside the banh mi were OK, but the sandwich overall was delectable and the bread was soft and crunchy!

- pho (4/5): pho is also one of the better ones I have had in NYC. The noodles were solid and the broth was really good. Only thing is I wish the meat was a bit soft and tender, and also wish there was option to add tripe!

- cha ca (2.5/5): I have had Cha ca in hanoi before and this did not taste like it. The flavors felt a bit off and did not love how the fish was cooked

Solid Vietnamese food - def try the pho and the banh mi!",28/5/2025,Food & Beverage

La Dong,5,"If you're looking for Vietnamese cuisine that hits both the comfort and wow factor, La Dông is it. From the moment we walked in, the space blew us away--warm wooden accents, arched details, and vintage-style lanterns gave it a cozy yet upscale vibe. It somehow feels both like a hidden gem and a trendy destination at the same time.

I ordered the shrimp with sugarcane served alongside a flavorful plum dipping sauce. It was beautifully presented and delicious--the shrimp was tender and savory with a hint of sweetness from the sugarcane, and the plum sauce added the perfect tangy balance.

My friends ordered the bánh mì and a bowl of pho. The bánh mì was generously filled and had that satisfying crunch you hope for in the bread. The pho had a rich, aromatic broth and was topped with fresh herbs and tender cuts of meat--definitely a standout.

Service was friendly and attentive, and even though the place was buzzing, we never felt rushed.

La Dông makes a strong case for being one of the best Vietnamese spots in the city--not just for the food, but for the full experience. I'll definitely be back",19/5/2025,Food & Beverage

FOOD
- tofu mushroom banh mi (5/10): grilled oyster and shimeji mushrooms with shredded carrots and fried tofu in a toasted baguette served with a side of mushroom broth. To make it vegan I asked for the mayo to be removed. The portion is very generous and lasted me two meals. I was underwhelmed by the taste of the filling especially the tofu. A good banh mi for me is one that has a lot of freshness from the herbs and pickles and has a firm tofu that could be marinated for more flavor. This tofu just tasted fried and there was not enough herbs. 

WOULD I GO BACK? As a vegan, no, but for someone who eats meat there are more options.",16/5/2025,Food & Beverage

Pho. Labeled with good ingredients. And the coffee was also chef's kiss. Loved the decor and detail to the style of cooking from that region.",14/5/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,"+
I wish I could give more than 5 stars! The beef pho and spring rolls are an absolute must-try -- packed with flavor and so satisfying. The service was excellent, and the staff made me feel genuinely welcome.
The food? Honestly, some of the best Vietnamese  I've ever had. I'll definitely be coming back again and again. Highly recommend!",4/8/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"Nothing special - HONESTLY, the food is good, but it's overpriced, but that's Manhattan culture for you! It also leans more towards ""fusion"", as it's the sister restaurant of Pranakhon + Thai Villa, both of which are Thai restaurants, and you see the fusion in the menu with the option of Crab Fried Rice. 

For apps, I'd rec the Steamed Rice Cakes, which come in a portion of 4 small dishes. The Chicken Wings weren't bad, just quite slim and pretty sweet. We got the Fried Branzino, which comes with a bowl of rice. It looked much easier to eat than the Dill + Turmeric version. It was good, but again, overpriced! 

I'd SKIP the Wagyu Pho - the theatrics where they pour in the broth is pretty much what you pay for, besides the meat, but we also got the regular Beef Pho and they pretty much tasted the same!! These are also supposedly Northern style pho styles, but my Viet friend noted that the broth didn't taste very northern.

Staff is GREAT! Overall, I'm glad that I tried this spot, but would go elsewhere for comparable taste and cheaper prices.",19/4/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,"WOW!!! We happened to be in the area and decided to check out it out. The hostesses were very friendly despite being walk-ins and took our cocktail orders while we waited. 

The four of us went with the server's recommendations and shared the following: -summer roll (really flavorful)
-crepe/Banh xeo (a modern spin of the traditional crepe, tasty)
-shaking beef (the only dish that didn't taste as good as what you'd get at a regular Vietnamese place)
-morning glory (small portion but yummy)
- banh mi (generous portion, and surprisingly delicious)
- fried fish/ca chien nouc mam (OMG! This was the dish..good to share too)

Beautiful decors, delicious & boozy cocktails (Red Dao), attentive service, and amazing food...it doesn't get any better than that!",18/4/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,"I don't eat at a lot of Vietnamese restaurants in NYC so I was really looking forward to trying La Dong. As soon as I stepped in, I could tell this is one of the prettiest restaurants I've ever been to. Everything from the ceilings, to the walls, to the tables were decorated beautifully. To start off, they give you complimentary shrimp chips & paste.  The service from start to finish was impeccable. They took my order pretty quickly and I had little wait time for my drinks/food. They were thoughtful in explaining any dishes I had a question with, they replaced our plates in between appetizers and entrees, and would constantly clean the crumbs or empty plates on our table throughout the night. They also provided wipes for your handed to use as a lot of the appetizers require you to use your hands to make wraps.  

Here is what I ordered:
Sugarcane Shrimp - consistency was like a fish ball (but shrimp...) and the sauce was sweet and tangy 
Crispy Spring Rolls - so crispy and juicy, doesn't look like the authentic spring rolls I've tried at other places but it was so good in it's own way and the cabbage/cilantro balances out the oils
Dry Duck Noodle - never tried this type of dish before (because I normally order pho) but I wanted to try something new, the noodles had flavors I never had before and the duck was CRISPY to perfection on the outside and well flavored/moist on the inside 
Classic Banh Mi - baguette was so crispy and the ingredients inside were so fresh, it comes with a side of truffle soup which complimented it so well and helped wash it down 

None of the dishes disappointed! PLEASE TRY THIS PLACE",6/4/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"A beautiful Vietnamese spot in a great location! Was immediately in awe of the beautiful tiles and interior. The host and servers greeted us so warmly when entering! 

One of those spots where you can do a casual $20 banh mi/pho meal here or branch out and try a bunch of specials and drinks for $$$. 

Their appetizers were the star of the show. Tried the pomelo salad and the banh xeo. First time trying banh xeo and it was SO GOOD. like a fried omelet taco with fresh veggies and tangy fish sauce! the pomelo salad was also very good, loved the coconut crunch. the fish sauce was overwhelming by itself and the chips were hard to eat with the salad. Also tried the short rib curry which came w half a baguette. Very yummy but a lot of meat. Would definitely
not recommend if you are getting one dish because it is so meat and carb heavy. Meat was tender and came off the bone. $47pp split between two. 

Will come back to try their pho and other appetizers!",28/4/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,3,"We got the soft shell crab salad, crab fried rice (good amount of lump crab on top) and bun bo hue! Everything was a good portion size with nice flavors. The bun bo hue had a nice flavor with a large pork knuckle and the pork blood which I don't usually enjoy was very soft and pleasantly not too iron-y. 

Only reason it's not 4-5 stars is because we kept feeling rushed. The waitstaff asked us no less than 5 times if we were done despite me responding with we were still eating/picking each time. They also completely forgot my friends iced coffee  Pricey for Vietnamese food but recommend trying it at least once.",7/7/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"For a cute date night or GNO, La Dong is up your alley! Adorned with cute decor & a gorgeous mural when you step into the resto, this place is worth visiting for good aesthetics and good food.

Make ressies before heading in - save yourself the wait!",5/4/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"We walked in around 6pm on a Thursday and were able to get seated right away. The ambiance of the place is lovely and the service was incredible. Everyone was super friendly and the food literally came out within 10 minutes. It was one of the quickest dinners I've ever had. 

As far as the food is concerned, I really loved my pho. The broth felt clean and smooth, and the beef was super tender. My only complaint was that the portions seemed small for the price. Otherwise, it might be my favorite pho spot in the city (for now).",11/4/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"Delicious Vietnamese food and great service made La Dong an excellent choice for dinner!

The menu is full of classic dishes, with small twists. The summer rolls were packed with fresh ingredients, but eschewed the peanut sauce in favor of something that almost tasted like a curry.

The pho was delicious, with a fantastic broth and lots of meat. The thicker noodles weren't my favorite, but still good! And they skip the usual accoutrements, giving only two sides to add to your bowl.

Prices weren't too bad for all the food you get. I'd stop by here again for sure!",13/3/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,"It was a busy summer weekday night so we were a bit worried about being a walk-in group, but they quickly found us a table. One of my dining companions never had Vietnamese food before -- the staff was very patient in answering questions. It was all very good and easy to share family style. I also liked how the restroom area had a sink so you can wash your hands w/o waiting in line for the bathroom.",31/7/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,"Really good food, super attentive staff, and stunningly decorated space. We had the sugarcane shrimp appetizer, classic bahn mi, and Waygu pho. All were delicious, but the bahn mi stood out as especially elevated -- it came with a truffle soup that was a perfect compliment to the fresh toppings and flavourful meat filling. The staff were highly attentive, keeping the water glasses full, removing all trash from the table almost instantaneously, and guiding you through your space. The decor is varied and stunning, everything shows a great attention to detail -- beautiful space for a delicious meal!",20/6/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"La Dong is a beautifully and culturally adorned spacious  Vietnamese restaurant around Union square. Somehow it kept coming up on my insta newsfeed which led to our weekend lunch here. Reservations were very easy to make.

The service needs improvement in that they were too attentively trying to clear food from our table when we were still eating. We hadn't even been there for an hour yet so we felt rushed and unable to enjoy catching up.

The food was really good though. I really liked the crab fried rice. My friends really enjoyed the pho. The crispy spring rolls were above average as well.

Despite the good food, not sure if we are going to come back given the rushed service.",23/2/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"Beautiful space, delicious food, fast service. Make sure you get a reservation during peak hours, it gets very busy on the weekend. We got a bunch of things to share and the highlights for me were the pâté, chicken wings, wagyu pho and the grilled Bronzino with dill. Will definitely be back if I'm craving for Vietnamese!",1/6/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,"Next level Vietnamese food, amazing ambiance, noise levels on the average end and, great location! Can't ask for anything more I guess?

When traditional classics are elevated to next level, we appreciate that food a lot. The best Vegetable Pho ($21) I've ever had, where the broth packs a lot of flavor. The accoutrements consist of some spicy chilies and vinegar garlic which elevate the taste further, and just when you think you have a perfect dish, a spice packed garlic, cilantro hot sauce if what you can request for, if you enjoy spicy food - which goes extremely well with the rice noodles!

The Crab Fried Rice ($32) from the Chefs special menu was amazing too and was a good plate to share between two. This dish accompanies the hot sauce.

Specific shoutout to Jaycee for her excellent service, attentiveness, and her contagious smile! Will definitely visit again and will be the go to recommendation for Vietnamese food.",16/2/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"Tried La Dong for lunch as a family and had a great experience! While they don't have a ton of veggie options, there are enough to have a choice, including a veggie bahn mi and pho. They don't do changes or substitutions, so nothing else can be modified to be made vegetarian.

The service was AMAZING. They were so kind and accommodating of our toddler. They gave us an extra table for more space and brought out crackers and pieces of pomelo especially for him!

We ordered:

Summer Roll Cara Cara - Loved the flavor added by the cara cara oranges and the peanut sauce was .

Tofu and Mushroom Bánh Mì - Big enough to last two meals and comes with truffle soup. A few too many mushrooms for me, but I loved the tofu and spicy mayo.

As far as the space, the bar and dining area are beautiful with elegant Vietnamese touches throughout. Even the bathrooms are thoughtfully done (I love the sink!). I would go back just to sit at the bar and get a drink...the espresso martini is calling my name.",25/3/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,I appreciate this place entirely. Every team member was cordial and approachable. Their kitchen serves nothing old. Every component of this restaurant matters. The quality is exceptional!,26/8/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,"One of the best Vietnamese restaurants I've ever been to! The restaurant is beautifully decorated with Vietnamese murals and lotus lamps, which makes this perfect for a date night or dinner with friends. 

I ordered the Ca Ri Suon Bo (beef short ribs curry), which came with a baguette on the side. The short ribs were so tender, they almost melted in my mouth. The curry was a perfect balance of spices, and paired beautifully with the soft and fluffy baguette. 

Will definitely be coming back!",23/3/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,"Food (5/5): Wow! This might be my favorite and the best Vietnamese restaurant place I've been to! The ribeye pho was possibly the best pho I've had. The meat was so melt in your mouth and the broth unbelievably delicious. All the dishes were so amazing. The prices are a bit higher but totally worth it.

Service (5/5): The servers were helpful and attentive with food coming out fast. 

Ambiance (5/5): Beautiful upscale ambiance with umbrellas in the ceiling and the whole place looking fancy. Really nice spot.",18/2/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,"La Dong is bringing restaurant dining experiences back! Okay, maybe those experiences haven't gone anywhere but either way La Dong is crushing it. 

First there's the charming interior design of the place that has just the right amount of art direction and charm to make you feel like you're somewhere cool. Then there's the details -- like the branded plates and the cozy nooks and the weirdly dark bathrooms. Just more fun little immersive things that nobody bothers to do anymore. 

Then the service is super friendly and prompt, lovely people who are chatty and down to help you decide from all the lovely things on the menu. And then of course there's the menu -- amazing! A great mix of interesting Vietnamese food and recognizable staples, all of it darn delicious. The gigantic sesame rice cracker is a stand out appetizer, as was the tofu scallion and meatballs. Also a fan of the crab fried rice, which is a generously large portion. 

I can't wait to come back and explore the rest of the menu -- maybe next time with a bigger group so we can really taste it all.",17/2/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"Vietnamese fusion restaurant. I made a reservation, arrived early, and still needed to wait for my table to be ready. The food was great but not worth the hype. 

Pomelo Salad (Chandler pomelo, grilled shrimp, Cara Cara, lemongrass, Kaffir lime, green moscato grape, mint, shallot & toasted coconut tossed in spicy tamarind dressing) - I should request it not spicy so that it can be more refreshing. The salad does not have much pomelo; it is more toasted coconut.

Crispy Spring Roll (pork, crab, shrimp, wood ear mushroom, carrot stuffed in a Vietnamese net wrapper) - It's not too oily, but I can't tell if there are crab and shrimp since they were well mixed with the pork paste.

Pho Ha Noi ( rice noodles, slow-cooked brisket, raw chuck eye, shallot, scallion, cilantro, side of pickle, garlic, and bird eye chili): The broth had a deep, rich beef flavor. The pho was overpriced for the portion, but the meat quality was definitely better than at other traditional Pho restaurants.",15/3/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"Not a bad spot for Vietnamese food, but I would say that it does lean more towards fusion, rather than authentic Vietnamese. The interior of the restaurant is dimly lit, lively, and has trends of traditional Vietnamese decor. Service was friendly and fairly quick.

We ordered the banh beo, the banh xeo, the bun bo hue, the tamarind duck, and avocado ice cream (at the end). At the beginning of your meal, they give you complimentary shrimp chips with a chili sate, which was sweet and savory. The banh beo was pretty good and I would definitely re-order. The banh xeo was a bit of a surprise as it came out in a taco shell, and there weren't any flavors of tumeric or coconut (I was a bit disappointed by this dish). The fish sauce for both dishes were REALLY light so I had to ask for straight fish sauce. The bun bo hue was pretty solid and came with lots of meat. And, my favorite dish of the night was the tamarind duck, which I could eat any day--it was so good. Overall, not a bad spot for some Vietnamese food.",11/3/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,"Loved it, I'm not a repeat person but I'll come back here :) Food is yummy, service friendly and fast, and ambiance is lively! 

I didn't have any traditional Vietnamese dishes but I'll come back for that to see how they are.

The items I did try - sugarcane shrimp, ca chien nuoc mam (fried branzino), and dry duck noodle were delicious! People who like sweet sauces will like the sauces here. Everything is very flavorful and plated nicely.

Our server was great and sooo fast. They clear the table and make room for more dishes for you. We finished paying and sat and chatted for 10-15 min and they didn't rush us out which was very nice of them.

Overall coming back to try more :)",9/7/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,"We were able to make a same day reservation on the weekend. The restaurant is beautifully decorated, but the tables were a bit close together. The service was friendly and we were able to take our time. We ordered the Bún Chả Hanoi which comes with grilled pork skewers, crab & shrimp spring roll, vermicelli, fresh herbs, pickle & sweet fish sauce dip. We also got the Pho Hà Nội which comes with rice noodle, slow cooked brisket, raw chuck eye, shallot, scallion, cilantro, side of pickled garlic & bird eye chili. This was plenty of food for 2 people and we were both full after. The pho soup was flavorful and it came with a good portion of meat. I wish the waitress explained how to properly eat the Bún Chả Hanoi, but we just made rolls with the lettuce and rice noodles and meat. The grilled pork and spring rolls were flavorful and well prepared. I will definitely be back!",1/6/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"Grabbed a dinner reservation for a small group and we're seated once our entire party arrived. Service was friendly and informative with suggestions around the menu provided as needed.

We got wagyu pho and beef cubes. The portions were a little smaller than expected but overall had good flavors. We had crispy spring rolls to start and ice cream for dessert. All in all, the food we ordered was good.

The interior was well designed with very pretty details around - I'd say the highlight of the experience. In summary, cute spot worth a shot.",1/3/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,"Fantastic Vietnamese restaurant off Union Square.
The interior is beautifully designed with lots of dark wood and feels authentically SE Asian.
Servers are delightful, very helpful, pleasant and efficient. 
We came for lunch and the food was excellent. We ordered the side add ons as well as the lunch menu items but the portions were so generous we need not have.
What we ate:
Cara Cara Summer Roll. This was light and refreshing. I frequently find the Peanut dipping sauce served with summer rolls to be cloying, this one wasn't. 
Spring Rolls. These were made with some sort of shredded outer wrapper that was crisp and crunchy rather than the usual soy or rice paper. The pork and crab filling was good. Really enjoyed these! 
Salad. Lunch comes with a complimentary small salad. It was great and had a yuzu soy dressing that had a wasabi type heat.
Pork Bahn Mi. Delicious, over stuffed sandwich. The pork was braised and tender and balanced well with the pickled vegetables. I'd order this or one of the other Bahn Mi again for sure.
Lemongrass Chicken over rice. Delicious again. Big portion with plenty of chicken and a fried egg along with nuts and salad. The chicken was tender and flavorsome.
Prices at lunchtime are very reasonable especially given the sizes of the portions. At night the menu is more varied and slightly more expensive. I'd definitely come back here for either lunch or dinner and look forward to doing so soon!",5/5/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"For appetizer, we had the crispy spring rolls, which came with 4 pieces. I enjoyed the pho Hanoi which had a lot of meat. We sat at the bar since we didn't have reservations. Food was good, the pho noodles are slightly thicker than usual, perhaps that is the style/based on the region, but just a note.",27/7/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"For vegetarians, vibrant noodle soups and broths to pass the winter months are often hard to find. In very aesthetic environs near Union Square, La Dong is serving up a very soothing vegan pho with a heavy emphasis on assorted mushrooms for when one feels overwhelmed. A generous portion of green chili and a slice of lime on the side take the broth to the next level of depth.

I'm always surprised that the area immediately around Union Square is so barren of quality eats, so La Dong will definitely be a recurring destination for me.",2/1/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"Good place for Vietnamese food! Came with a friend and shared two dishes.

The crab fried rice is definitely one of the better ones I've had. It comes with a sauce that helps make it flavorful and there is lots of crab on top. The dry beef pho was also good, lovely sauce with a bunch of vegetables and different meats.",20/2/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,"# Overall:
Definitely can recommend giving Ladong a try. I would recommend the classic pho over the wagyu pho. Since it was my first time here, decided to not be too adventurous with the menu, but there is an extensive menu that I intend on exploring more the next time I come back!

# Ambiance
Ladong's is right next to Union Square. From the street, the only indication you're in the right place is a big red sign with their name. Even though their facade is basically large windows, you don't really get a feel for their vibes until you're inside. Everything comes together to give a nice welcome and homely feel.

# Food and Drink
Complimentary Shrimp Crackers
As you decide on your order, you're presented with a few shrimp crackers and some chili sauce to go with them. The shrimp crackers are nice and light. The chili sauce is not spicy but very strong in umami flavor.

Pho Ha Noi
I really enjoyed the pho here. The flavors just seemed to click for me. The broth was nice and hearty. The bird eye chilis were a perfect way to add spice. The pickled garlic added a new flavor profile.

Wagyu Pho
This pho was special in that the server will pour out the broth during serving (as opposed to a normal pho like the Pho Ha Noi). This was my girlfriend's dish and aside from the presentation, she didn't really feel that this pho was that much different from the Pho Ha Noi. 

Pork Banh mi
Decided to order this instead of an appetizer since I heard about dipping the banh mi into the provided soup. The banh mi itself is a decent size, and while not the best banh mi I've ever had, it feels like a different dish with the dip soup. The banh mi itself still tasted good, but maybe could've gone without the mayo.",31/12/2024,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"I ordered the signature classic pho, which was quite tasty but not particularly amazing. However, the coffee was very good and the service was excellent. The interior decor has great atmosphere.",2/8/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"The food was good, but didn't quite live up to the hype. The restaurant has a cool-looking interior.

Summer roll - a bit bland on its own, mostly relying on the sauce to give it flavor. I found that the roll disintegrated very quickly while holding it.

Banh mi - nice fluffy bread and tart and crunchy fillings. The tofu had a nice chew to it as well. The truffle and vegetable soup served with it was nice and subtle.

Salted coconut coffee - not too sweet and in good balance.",12/2/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,3,"I think the vibes are great. The decoration is cozy and somewhat Vietnam inspired. I gave 5 stars for the atmosphere here. 

However, for the food, as Vietnamese, I think it doesn't have the base taste of what Vietnamese dishes supposed to taste like. The server was trying to upsell every time she can, make the experience a little bit awkward",6/2/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,"Came to this place with 2 people and decided to do family style dinner. I was shocked by all the beautiful decorations. Everything and everywhere looked so pretty. The service was great. The server explained the entire menu to us and recommended us the popular dishes. We order waygu pho, grilled pork with dipping noodle, and fried branzino. It was quite pricey but the food was delicious. 

The pho came out first and the server poured the soup into the bowl (super fancy). The waygu was super tender and the soup was amazing. The grilled pork was very tender and juicy also. The fried branzino was very good also. It wasn't too oily and the fish was in pieces so it was very easy to share. Overall, we had a great experience and will come back again!",17/12/2024,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,"Had a wonderful exeprience at La Dong! It is very refreshing to find an elevated vietnamese restaurant done at such an excellent quality.

My party tried a mix of items, with my personal favorite being the ca ri hai san (seafood curry), which tasted velvety smooth backed by punchy flavors... I have been thinking about this dish for a few days now! Other people also really enjoyed the wagyu pho, which was delightful.

We also tried an avocado ice cream at the end, which helped to end the meal nicely. Service at the restaurant was also superb!",4/2/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"One of the most beautiful and well decorated restaurants I've been to! The wagyu pho was flavorful and the meat was super tender!

Good pho, but a little pricey",3/2/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"Came here for lunch with some coworkers on a weekday around noon and were seated immediately without a reservation. They offer up a lunch special around $16-$19 pre-tax/tip depending on what you get. They do also offer their full menu, too.

Got the lunch special pho Ha Noi with a salad. Salad was pretty small, but tasted fine with the citrus-y dressing. Pho itself was also fine. Nothing to write home about. I did find it interesting they served it with pickled garlic and peppers instead of sriracha and oyster sauce. Either way, the broth was clean enough although maybe felt like it might've been heavy on MSG. Noodles were slightly thicker rice noodles. Heavy on the green onions which I like.

Overall, it was a fine lunch spot. Service was quick and friendly and interior is nice too. A solid option if you're looking for a casual lunch spot in the area, but don't expect the pinnacle of Vietnamese cuisine here.",21/1/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,"There's not many upscale Viet places in the city, so I love that La Dong has popped up to fill the void! Their menu features both classics with an elevated twist, as well as more traditional items. My favorites are the Wagyu Pho (some of the best pho broth I've tasted!) and the Pate & Bone Marrow. Some other dishes I've tried and enjoyed: Bun Cha Hanoi, Steamed Rice Cake, Crab Fried Rice, Morning Glory

The atmosphere here is great as well! Very beautiful and elegant space with friendly staff and great service. Plus, I've come here 3 times for weeknight dinners without reservations and have never had to wait for a table.",16/1/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"We called ahead to join the waitlist and upon arrival we were seated immediately. The restaurant is very aesthetically pleasing with warm lighting and trendy styling. 

- beef pho: broth was clean and meat was delicious. The noodles are on the thicker side compared to traditional thin rice noodles, which I enjoyed. The pho comes with chili peppers and garlic on the side to adjust the flavor. 

This place is a modern twist on Vietnamese food. The service is quick and food came out immediately.",10/11/2024,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"I took my friend from CA out for girl night. We supposed to go to other restaurant, but it was closed for a private event for few hours, so we found this Thai Vietnamese restaurant next-door, and they have vegetarian option for my friend, so we decided to eat here. 

I'm very easy eating so every food we order here are no meat dishes. We start with.....

- Vegetable summer roll: it is ok, I'm not crazy about the dipping sauce so our server gives me a seafood sauce (which spicier but my friend couldn't eat it because it has fish sauce inside)

- Sauteed morning glory: also good but a bit salty, probably have to eat with rice but we just have it as a appetizer.

- Vegetable Pho: I admit nothing compared to an authentic Vietnamese restaurant in Queens. 

- Overall, food is ok, decoration is great, very beautiful place especially decoration on the ceiling. Service is very friendly and polite. If you are not serious about real taste of food, this place is trendy and have very nice ambiance.",31/3/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,"I came here twice:
1st time was for lunch on a weekend. We had an amazing appetizer which is chips where you can dip in their sambal. I really enjoyed it. We then had pho. I had the regular one and my partner had the Wagyu pho. It is certainly not Houston pho and I am not sure if it is viet pho. It does have northern pho roots. But overall I still greatly enjoyed it. I think one might need to not picture it or compare it to Houston or viet pho. Overall still a very great bowl of noodles. Slightly pricey though so def something one can try once.

For lunch special on a weekday, I thought it was priced well. What I also liked was I was able to had an appetizer add on. Normally you would have to order a whole appetizer and would require a few more people in a group to try more of the items. But for a fraction of the price I can simple get a taste of what apps they offer which I really appreciate. So def take advantage of the weekday lunch specials and ordering the add ons. The pho ga was good, def good chicken and very standard and good pho ga. Zero complaints. I personally really liked the dry pho. My only complaint is that it was too big and too much beef? (If that is even a complaint). After a salad or a soup, I really couldn't finish the dry pho. It may look rather small but when eating it felt pretty hefty. It's more like a Lo mein so it isn't completely dry. But I really liked the soy sauce mixture.

So overall def recommend la dong, just don't expect it to be like your average viet spot. Think of it as a fusion spot and you would really appreciate the little hints of changes and differences.",10/1/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,"Great food and vibes! 
The inside is super spacious and there are plenty of seats. I went as a group of 4 and our food came out fairly quickly after we ordered. 
The star of the show are definitely appetizers. From the complimentary crackers to the sugarcane shrimp, rice cakes and the papaya salad with chicken skin, the appetizers are so unique and delicious. We were quite full after all the appetizers! Their main entrees like the pho ha noi or the bun cha hanoi are good but nothing spectacular. The pho noodles were a bit thicker than normal and the broth was decent.
Overall, I would definitely recommend!",4/1/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,"I'm pretty sure I've written previously that I actually don't care about the decor of a restaurant, as I'm more interested in the food. Well, La Dong made me care. It's freaking beautiful in here. Whoever designed this place deserves some sort of award. The ceiling of umbrellas is an amazing touch, and I love that mural up front as well.

Luckily the food is excellent as well.*

We shared a number of starters, and while they were beautiful and tasty (banh xeo!), the complimentary shrimp chips and the mains were the standouts for me. Namely:

1. The Ca Ri Hai San Ca, a seafood and egg curry concoction that had us wanting to lick the plate, and  

2. The Chien Nuoc Mam, a deboned branzino that was fried and sauced to perfection. It's served with the skeleton curled the plate like the serpent Jörmungandr, except instead of being curled around the world, it was curled around the most delicious chunks of fish you've ever tasted. 

Enjoy.

*You should be aware that the food may not necessarily be ""authentic"" Vietnamese food. However, I think these complaints should largely be ignored, as (1) food is not static; it is ever-evolving, and the heavy French influence on Vietnamese cuisine should have you questioning what specific point in history do you want current food to emulate? Also, (2) if the food here at La Dong was ""authentic"" no doubt people would be complaining about the prices and how they could get the same thing for less elsewhere.",21/10/2024,Food & Beverage
La Dong,3,"La Dong is a new Vietnamese fusion restaurant opened by the team behind Thai Villa, which I am a big fan of. I had the opportunity to dine here with a friend recently and was overall a bit disappointed.

We got to try the steamed rice cake and pho. The steamed rice cake had a nice presentation but was served lukewarm and was a bit tough to eat. Overall, it wasn't my favorite thing and I wish I tried the spring or summer rolls instead. The pho had a nice, flavorful broth but I honestly think the local Vietnamese restaurant around the block from my apartment is similar in quality and significantly cheaper. It just wasn't very memorable and I preferred having the more traditional sides and fixings. Where were my bean sprouts?!

The restaurant is beautiful and the vibes were on point, as expected by the group behind Thai Villa. Service was quick but attentive and polite. Overall, it wasn't bad but I guess I wanted a more authentic experience. Maybe I ordered the wrong things but I am willing to go back and try it again.",9/11/2024,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"The service was nice but the restaurant is quite crowded. It was very hard to sit in our booth or even get out of it. If you are able to get a seat, I would recommend asking for the middle table. 

1. Sugarcane Shrimp (8/10): Good sauce, flavor was good, would get again
2. Morning Glory (8/10): Delicious but so small and not worth the price
3. Bun Cha Hanoi (8/10): Hard to eat, not much meat and hard to share
4. Manila Clams (mussels) (5/10): They ran out of clams and substituted it with mussels but it was not fresh at all and did not taste very good. Flavor is also super bland
5. Wagyu Pho (10/10): Super clean, not heavy, probably my favorite thing there that gave this a higher rating. Would definitely go back for 
6. Crab Fried Rice (8/10): It was fine, very standard, had good amounts of crab 

I was not very impressed by the drinks but it is a cute place for dinner. I was also sad that there wasn't much dessert on the menu. I would definitely come back to try the banh mi and more pho next time.",26/12/2024,Food & Beverage
La Dong,3,"Food:

Waygu Pho 3/5 - I get that the price point is based on the meat but no bowl of pho should cost $34.  Note that this is the pho in general is the Northern Vietnam style so you won't get the same condiments as you're used to.   Pho was good but not for that price

Bo luc lac (shaking beef) 4/5 - great flavor and also overly priced, but they're using Waygu steak so I guess it's expected

Crispy spring roll 2.5/5 - not what I expected but it's got a much different wrap on it.   Some kind of flaky outer shell.  I also don't love when a Vietnamese restaurant uses the words summer and spring rolls incorrectly.   We only use spring rolls and egg rolls if you want to be legit

Ambiance - 5/5 for the vibe and feel of the restaurant

Service 5/5 - waitress was prompt with taking our orders and checking up on us

Overall, decent place for Vietnamese food but I'm still on the hunt for a great one in NYC",3/11/2024,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"We ordered steam mussels, beef wagyu pho, grilled Branzino and Grilled pork (Bun Cha) and coconut ice cream. Overall the foods are delicious and flavorful. I'd surely give five stars for the steam mussels and grilled Branzino and coconut ice cream.

The service deserves a Five stars. Everyone is friendly and respectful. A shout out to our waitress, Tari B, who explained about the menu clearly and patiently and served our dinner with a smile.

The decor and ambiance of this restaurant is very pleasant. We came for dinner and during peak hours. The lighting is nice and the noise level is good.",21/12/2024,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"Vibes & ambiance? Check and Check! Prepare to be wowed the second you walk in the door. This restaurant is from the same team behind Thai Villa which will become clear right away. It is beautiful, so cozy and you'll feel like you are walking into a very special space. Honestly even the bathrooms were gorgeous...

The food is also noteworthy, don't worry. They started us with complimentary fish chips, and our first app of the night were the Banh Beo (steamed rice cake). It's served in four small dishes that you add a little sauce to and dig in. It was tasty! Next were the banh xeo (Vietnamese tumeric crepe). Also very tasty but it was served on a waffle cone ish sort of taco shell. I loved the filling of shrimp, shallots and beansprouts. Next time I visit, I would pass on ordering those two dishes again. 

Onto the things I LOVED. One of my favorites of the meal was the Ca Ri Hai San (stir fried seafood & egg). The sauce was so flavorful and cream, I couldn't get enough of it over rice. And oh man, the seafood bites mixed in were delicious. 

If you are looking for the perfect thing to share with the table and you love seafood as much as me, get the Ca Chien Nuoc Mam (fried deboned whole branzino)! There was another whole branzino on the menu but we went with this was basically because no one was up for deboning a shared fish. It was truly SO good and I can't recommend it enough. 

We needed a little bit of green on the table so we got the morning glory veggies as the perfect fresh bite. 

It was a great lunch and I cannot wait to stop back in.",8/10/2024,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"So we ordered the fish and I'm not sure what was going on but I felt a bit allergic to whatever was on it. My throat wasn't closing up or anything but it was feeling uncomfortable for sure. It was a bit difficult to eat between two people so I probably wouldn't recommend it as your protein of choice between two people. Everything else was okay not bad food and drinks. 

The establishment is beautiful though. I'd probably give it a 3.5, so will round to 4.",16/12/2024,Food & Beverage
La Dong,2,"Disappointing. Pho broth flavor is okay; dry pho is unfortunately nothing like a real pho kho, had weirdly rubbery noodles and underwhelming seasoning.

The bone marrow and chicken liver pate appetizer came with a bone containing the least amount of marrow I've ever seen. It was legit less than half a teaspoon's worth of marrow, this plate should never have passed quality control and left the kitchen.",16/12/2024,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,"Loved trying a new restaurant in NYC - and we love Vietnamese food! La Dong offers a new taken on your favorite classics! Great service, great flavors - would highly recommend

La Dong,4,"Bougie Viet place. Loved the bo luc lac!! The branzino is a must-get. 

For alcohol, they had a limited cocktail menu with 4 drinks. ""Ca Phe"" was like an espresso martini. 

Really beautiful decor, great date spot!",5/12/2024,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,"Came back for round two with the kids. Did a walk in at 6:15pm as I couldn't find a reservation on line. They were very nice and gave me a table that I had to give back within an hour, which was fine with me given it was a school night anyway. 

Tasty dishes, kids loved the pho! The broth was so flavourful. So happy to have this restaurant in the neighbourhood!",14/10/2024,Food & Beverage
La Dong,2,"Pretty dissapointed with this new viet resto. Pho was relatively bland and the noodles were really soft and broken. Bún Bò Huế had slightly more flavor in the soup but still lacking. Some of the appies were ok but we came for the pho and are judging this one by the same. Also this was pricey for what it really was so value going to take a hit as well. Overall, would pass.

La Dong,5,"From the moment I walked into La Dong, I felt genuinely welcomed. The host greeted me with grace, and soon after, I was seated and greeted by a waiter whose smile and energy lit up the room. I was hungry, and he got straight to the point--efficient, kind, and attentive.

While waiting for my chicken pho, I was surprised with a complimentary snack that literally melted in my mouth. Such a thoughtful touch and absolutely delicious.

The best pho I've ever had, rich, flavorful broth, perfectly tender chicken, and fresh herbs that brought everything together. I didn't need or want anything else. I was fully satisfied and left so happy.

The ambiance was cozy, clean, and calming. If you're looking for soul-warming pho, La Dong is the place to go.",21/5/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"We were planning a cousins' dinner and one of my cousins recommended La Dong. She had been there before and vouched for the food. We had a 6:00pm reservation, but two of us ended up being a bit late. They were still able to sit us, but warned that they would start the 1.5 hour dining time at the point they sat us, regardless of when our last person arrived. This was fine with us, as we were the ones who were late. 

We ended up splitting everything, so here's a giant list of all the food that we ordered for 4 people: 
- Steamed Rice Cakes with shrimp, dried shrimp, scallion oil, shallot, garlic & Vietnamese dipping sauce
- Nem Nướng, or grilled meatballs, served in red leaf lettuce wrap,
Cara Cara orange, ginger, cucumber, toasted coconut, shallot & peanut sauce
- Pâté & Bone: chicken liver mousse, pickle, bone marrow & toasted baguette
- Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio with *rare* American wagyu slices, fresh lime, shrimp paste, watercress, Vietnamese coriander, peanut, crispy shallots & bird's eye chili
- Cá Chiên Nước Mắm: fried whole Branzino (de-boned) tossed in sweet fish sauce glaze, fresh greens & herbs
- Shaking Beef: wok tossed American Wagyu cubes, onion, yellow pepper in garlic soy (served medium-rare) & watercress-cilantro salad
- Cà Ri Sườn Bò, or beef short rib curry: tender braised short ribs in Vietnamese yellow curry, baby carrot & coconut milk
served with baguette. creamy, spicy & fragrant
- Classic Banh Mi with homemade pork sausage, ground pork spread, chicken pâté, fresh herbs, pickle & Vietnamese mayo

Ok, perhaps our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. But it was so good. 

My favorites out of the appetizers were the Steamed Rice Cakes and the Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio. The beef carpaccio was super fresh and I loved the mixture of sauce that was layered on top of the carpaccio. It gave the beef such a fresh, crisp flavor. Out of the entrees, I would say the banh mi and the beef short rib curry were my favorites. I'm a sucker for a good coconut milk curry and this one did not disappoint. It was so flagrant and flavorful. 

Service was great and our waitress was super friendly. 

And perhaps this is more my fault than anything, for not asking, because you always have to ask for the price when it comes to specials. But I did order our waitress's recommendation for a drink and it ended up being $43 for essentially a penicillin with special whiskey. It tasted good, but I don't think I would've gotten it if I had known it would essentially be 2.5 the cost of everyone else's drink.",7/6/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,"Love the ambience, the service, and the pho.  Got there early on a Tuesday night before the dinner rush and was seated by the bar.  I started with their  shrimp crackers with a delicious sauce that had a bit of a tiny kick.  Then I moved into their signature beef pho with bone marrow add on and boy was it the star of the show.  I didn't think they added anything to the bone marrow, but they didn't need to anyway because it was already so fatty, gelatinous, rich, and dreamy on its own, I'm still salivating thinking of it.  The pho appeared to be topped with maybe fried shallots and there was a side of pickled garlic along with a side of chilies. rice noodle, slow cooked brisket, raw chuck eye, shallot, scallion, cilantro,
side of pickle garlic & bird eye chili.  Yum.  I would come again.",20/5/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,3,"More like 3.5 stars but rounding down. Opened by the same team as Thai Villa, the interior is beautiful! The servers were attentive and very sweet, better than Thai Villa for sure. The food was a bit hit or miss for us. We had the steamed rice cake and crispy spring rolls to start. I enjoyed both apps. The entrees were a bit medicore- we had the seafood yellow curry and wagyu pho. The pho broth wasn't as fragrant and rich as I usually like, but the wagyu slices and noodles were good. I wouldn't recommend the seafood yellow curry, the seafood was all extremely fishy and tasted very defrosted. The yellow curry itself was spicy yet sweet and I liked that, but the fishy seafood took away from the curry. 
Overall, not terrible but I heard such great things, I thought it would be better!",18/11/2024,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"Pretty solid but can be hit or miss depending on what you get.

Banh beo (steamed rice cake): 3/5, really thick which was not my favorite, but the shrimp was cooked well and I liked the toppings. I've just never had such a thick banh beo before.

Nem nuong: 3/5, I preferred this with just fish sauce rather than the peanut sauce it came with. The orange slice was a unique touch that made it feel more fusion-y. I didn't prefer it, but can see some liking it.

Bun cha: 5/5, loved the meat and egg roll and the fish sauce that comes with pieces of pork inside. A solid serving size with the lettuce wraps and vermicelli.

Crispy spring rolls: 5/5, other reviews said it lacked flavor but I loved it. We actually ordered this at the very end since we liked the roll in the bun cha so much. Fun texture with the netting wrap -- a little on the breadier side but still great.

Great service, great ambiance (although there seemed to be a draft at one of the tables since a few parties sat and then asked to be moved). Also, we didn't get any complimentary shrimp chips which I saw in a few reviews.

At the price point, I don't need to come back but I'd be open to.",18/11/2024,Food & Beverage
La Dong,3,"After seeing La Dong all over my social media, I was super eager to visit and see what all the hype was about. For starters, the interior of the restaurant is absolutely stunning. Throughout the restaurant, the ceiling is covered in umbrellas and gorgeous lotus flower lights, which are absolutely breathtaking. I came here on a Friday night with my boyfriend at around 5:30 and was able to be seated immediately! Here's what we ordered: 

Pho Ha Noi: (3.5/5) Although the broth was pretty flavorful and fragrant, the addition of the crispy onions became overpowering, making it taste almost like a French onion soup. Definitely not my favorite bowl of pho in NYC; however, it was still delicious! 

Pork Banh Mi: (3.5/5) The fact that every banh mi is accompanied by a side of truffle pho for dipping is INCREDIBLE. I wish every restaurant did this!! However, although the idea is amazing, the execution fell a bit flat. The pork itself felt dry and lacking in charred flavor despite the abundance of grill marks on the meat itself. Additionally, the truffle pho broth felt very one-dimensional and overly salty. 

Overall, our meal at La Dong felt just okay. While everything was tasty, I wasn't blown out of the park, and I definitely have other Vietnamese restaurants I'd gravitate toward instead. Good to try, but I don't know if I'd return.",9/11/2024,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,"Right when you come in you notice how beautiful the restaurant is and how welcoming the staff are. Our server was quick and attentive. She had outstanding recommendations and overall the service was flawless.

The food was as good as the service! Grilled meatball wraps are a great combination of different flavors and textures. My short rib curry was one of the best curries I've ever had. The short rib was so tender it fell apart at the touch. All of the ingredients in the curry were cooked very well. The baguette it came with for dipping was definitely baked in house. It was flaky on the outside and extremely fluffy. The pho was very good, the quality of the meat stood out the most.",3/5/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"A very welcoming and buzzy vibe. A bit loud for dinner conversation. I had the pomelo salad which was ear-tingling levels of spice and the vegetarian pho which was good but not packed with flavor. I'd like to return to try a meat dish. Many staff with earbuds floating around, my water level never dipped!",3/4/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"{Overall: 4.5; Food: 4.5} Ambiance: 4; Service: 4

La Dong is a great new Vietnamese restaurant in Union Square. 

The beef pho was very good. The broth was rich, flavorful, and salty. The toppings already come included in the soup, which makes it even more flavorful. The portion size is reasonable - not too big and not too small.

The Bahn Mi was the stand out dish of the evening. The bread was lightly crispy on the outside, and soft and warm on the inside! I've never had a Bahn Mi with warm bread in NYC. All of the vegetables inside the Bahn Mi were incredibly fresh and crisp. It had the right amount of pork and pate.

Some of the other dishes being served around me had a beautiful presentation and I'm looking forward to trying them next time.

The ambience of the restaurant is nice - it has a trendy and modern Vietnamese feel. The service was good.",3/3/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,"New to the neighborhood, this Northern Vietnamese spot brings an authentic taste with a modern twist in both food and decor. The design is charmingly Vietnamese yet contemporary--rattan lotus-shaped light fixtures add a beautiful touch! Nina our server is the sweetest! Overall service is swift, friendly, and accommodating for families with young kids, though still ironing out a few kinks due to the new opening. 

The menu offers a great variety of Vietnamese classics and northern specialties. The Pho Hanoi is delicious, especially with the fried dough, though the broth could use a bit more depth to really bring out those savory notes. The Banh Beo rice cakes were a highlight--perfectly chewy with crispy toppings, shrimp, and fish sauce creating that ideal balance. The grilled meatball is served like a taco in a lettuce cup. Quite the unique twist, with refreshing Cara Cara orange for a hint of zest.

Don't skip the mocktails! The Mock Mock Gee, a G&T-style mocktail, is phenomenal. Also the Mangarita packs lot of heat, beware! And if you love turmeric and spice, try the Cha Ca--hearty and flavorful, though a little extra scallion and dill would have perfected it.

Dessert was a simple yet satisfying end: avocado ice cream with banana crunch and jackfruit. Looking forward to coming back to explore more!",3/11/2024,Food & Beverage

La Dong,4,"La Dong is a new Vietnamese restaurant made by the Thai Villa folks that features creative takes on classic Vietnamese dishes. You should be aware that this spot is not necessarily ""authentic,"" however, the good news is that the food is pretty good. 

Service here is great, our server was helpful in navigating the menu and was attentive throughout the meal. No complaints!

The food here is pretty solid. My favorite was the pho, which I thought to be one of the better renditions in a city that doesn't have a ton of great pho. The broth was flavorful and fragrant, though don't expect huge portion sizes here. The bun cha was pretty solid, an above average take of the dish, though I'd say the flavors were a bit muted.

Overall, I think La Dong is solid! I'd come back here for sure, just for the pho, though there's some room for improvement.",29/10/2024,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,"My husband kept saying this is the best Vietnamese restaurant ever. The food was amazing, service was good and seating was comfortable.

La Dong,4,"It's hard to find a good Vietnamese joint in NYC (weird but true), so when La Dong opened, immediately knew I wanted to check it out. 

The menu had a lot of great options. Opted to get:
1. Water spinach: pretty good. Small though
2. Shaking beef: it was alright. I've had better elsewhere. The cilantro salad on the side was pretty bomb though. 
3. Bun cha: pretty good. 

Overall, the food in La Dong was pretty good, albeit servings were on the smaller side. Kinda pricey for the size of the servings. Would come back to check out the other food. 

Ambience was nice. Definitely a nicer Viet joint vs the others. Service was good. Tables were a bit cramped together to make the most of the space.

Even though they touted La Dong as modern Vietnamese, the food itself wasn't thaaat modern or different - probably the ambience vs anything. If you're looking for true bomb modern Viet, I'd opt for Monsieur Vo. Overall good, though nothing out of this world different",21/10/2024,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,10/10!! This restaurant was phenomenal. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu.,15/7/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,"This is currently my favourite restaurant of this year. Yes this place is fusion, yes it is elevated Vietnamese food, and yes it is more expensive than your typical Vietnamese restaurant, but it executes with skill so that each component is thoughtfully prepared with precision, ensuring that flavors are balanced and textures perfected - at least that's the case for my Bun Bo Hue dish. We usually go for hole in the wall, unassuming Vietnamese restaurants bc those usually have the best flavours, but at La Dong not only is the food delicious, but the décor is just absolutely gorgeous and such a vibe. 

I've been ordering Bun Bo Hue at all the restaurants that serve it, even at the Vietnamese restaurants in Philly and if you love Vietnamese food you know Philly is supposed to have amazing Vietnamese restaurants, but nothing has really hit the mark for this specific dish except for La Dong. The soup was flavourful, the meat was fresh and tender, and the noodles were cooked to the perfect texture. Every component of this dish was done perfectly here, while at other restaurants either the noodle texture wasn't great, or the pork hock wasn't tender enough, flavoured enough, or fresh enough...etc. 

The two sides that we tried were the morning glory and the crispy fried tofu scallion - we loved both and would recommend both. The tofu was velvety soft on the inside - I loved the texture and I also loved the flavour. 

I'm seeing a lot of reviews saying the pho was not very good, I feel like part of the negative response is probably due to the price point, however I personally have not tried the soup pho so I can't say. I did try a bit of the dry pho and it's a creative take on pho for those not feeling for hot soup. I liked the flavouring even though it is on the saltier side. The sauce used in it centers around the oyster dipping sauce that is served at all traditional pho restaurants. 

I really enjoyed this place. Our waitress was also super friendly and made us feel very welcomed.",13/2/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,"Truly amazing! From the food to the service, absolutely no complaints. The restaurant is so beautifully decorated too.

La Dong,5,"This restaurant just opened 4 days ago and is from the same owners as Thai Villa and Pranakhon! They gutted the whole area and built great architecture inside. Even for the 4th day, they had a sizable number of diners. 

They start out by giving you light crisps to dip into chili paste. We got the Vietnamese crêpe, which was basically like a taco or waffle cone wrap. The only downside was that it fell apart in our hand because of the crunch. 

The shaking beef was delicious and had a very good sauce. The grilled pork and dipping noodle was yummy as well. The winner here for me was dipping the vermicelli in the fish oil. 

Can't wait to try more -- this spot will get crowded quick.",20/9/2024,Food & Beverage

La Dong,5,"I dined at La Dong with two friends. One lives nearby. He recommended it based on having walked by many a time. He had a flight the next day, and, as a nervous traveler, he didn't wish to be out too far from home. The other two of us had to travel to the venue. I can say it was not a trip I regretted. (I actually took a rental bike there from a prior appointment. That was exhilarating and generated an appetite.)
This establishment exemplifies a new trend of Asian restaurants moving upmarket. Scholars have studied the price points and popular perceptions of different ethnic cuisines. Some such as French, or an outlier among Asian offerings, Japanese, can command premiums with the public, while others such as Chinese and likely Vietnamese have been historically associated with more affordable niches. As much as the change is to be welcomed for the symbolism as to respect for the communities from which the food originated, it also means that the diner will be charged more. In this instance, however, the menu listings were not outrageous, and, more importantly, were worth the charge. The ambiance suggests fancier. The service, likewise. 
We shared two starters. One was the pate and bone marrow. The other was the morning glory. Each was flavorful in its own manner. The former was generous compared to the same item elsewhere. The latter was fresh and well seasoned, a necessary green to accompany the otherwise heavier entrees.
Our party had, respectively, a classic banh mi, a beef main course, and mussels in the appetizer size. Everyone enjoyed their choice. The banh mi was enough for leftovers. The beef looked great. The mussels were the smaller species, in a southeast Asian inflected broth. For dessert, despite my own interest in sampling the avocado ice cream, we settled on a more plain vanilla, albeit accompanied by either giant boba or whatever the proper term is for such tapioca, and a cookie that had subtle complex spices in the mixture. 
We were leisurely. Nobody rushed us. The tab was reasonable. Everyone surrounding us seemed to be similarly enjoying a night out on the town. I am accordingly pleased to commend the establishment. It would be well suited to a first date or a larger gathering. Kudos to the proprietors. They have struck the best balance.",7/3/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"Great Vietnamese spot, really nice decor love the vibe. Food was awesome, classics like pho, but they have a ton of entrees and apps as well.

La Dong,5,"The restaurant isn't that big so definitely make a reservation, they do have a nice waiting area and turn over seems fast. The service was excellent, food came quickly and was delicious. The morning glory veggies was very good, light (not greasy) and lots of garlic. Crab fried rice was so good I took an extra order to go! We shared the regular pho, which was very good. They give different condiments than the basil, sprouts, and like. They gave a tray with a few different sauces. 
We shared a pot of the secret garden tea, it was very floral and fragrant - sometimes floral teas are a bit bland but not this one, definitely can taste the rose and lavender. 
My only wish is that the table was bigger, since we shared so much we had share plates and bowls. Luckily nothing fell over.",28/2/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,"The restaurant transports you to south east Asia, or at least a glorified Hollywood version of it. Very cool vibes and very instagramable.
As for the food, we started with the crispy spring rolls and summer rolls, both with shrimp. The summer rolls held together perfectly in the usual rice paper wrap. The veggies were fresh and the shrimp was well cooked. Overall, what you would expect at a Vietnamese restaurant but double the price. The crispy spring rolls were excellent. They are wrapped in a net wrap, which is so much better IMO than the regular wrap. The filling was delicious, but nothing special. Lastly, for appetizers, we got the bone marrow. What a decadent dish. The fat from the bone marrow with a lob of pate work perfectly over a well toasted baguette. 
Now for the mains. The broth for the pho is incredible. I drank it up, which I probably shouldn't have - I assume it goes way over the daily recommended salt consumption. We got the pho with the wagyu. Super tender beef. Does not come with the usual Hoisin and sriracha sauce, but you don't need it. I kind of also miss the other accompaniments - beef balls, tendon, tripe. Overall, the quality of the noodles and broth were excellent.
Next came the duck tamarind. The sauce was so savory - I poured it over a bed of rice and went to town with it.
We got a grilled branzino, which came with lettuce and rice noodle - we wrapped it all together in the lettuce and dipped it in a citrus spiced sauce; flavors all worked incredibly well. Lastly, we got the crab fried rice. I didn't get to try any - was too full from the above - but my son thoroughly enjoyed it.
Service was excellent - attentive and helpful in assisting us in navigating the menu.

La Dong,4,"I was here at this unique Vietnamese restaurant earlier in the day with a group of six others. The food here is Vietnamese but elevated so don't exactly expect as traditional grub and the prices are slightly because of this and also because of the nice space. They have two sides of the menu including chef specialties and more traditional dishes though it's hard to say one side was that traditional when there is a $35 pho (nope.) Speaking of the nice space, the restaurant is honestly gorgeous and one of the better decorated restaurants from the mural in front to the paper lanterns above our seat which unfortunately had some red lighting so many of my photos came out a bit poorly. The staff here was pretty friendly but faulty as they forgot to bring out serving spoons occasionally and they brought out food extremely quickly especially for the main dishes which is very reminiscent of their other restaurant Pranakhon and Thai Villa. 

I started with a Calamansi Matcha Spritz which was very much calamansi forward with barely a hint of matcha but it was refreshing and worked throughout the meal and was only $7. I probably would instead get a hot Vietnamese coffee/cà phê sữa nóng next time instead of this or the iced version as it looked excellent on other tables. They gave us some crackers which had a dipping paste in the middle as a freebie to begin. The crackers were presumably tapioca only though they could have probably been shrimp/prawn crackers and had a good crunch while the dipping sauce was outstanding. It had some fish sauce flavor to it, a good amount of chili, and some sweetness but not too much so. It reminded me a little bit of a mixture of belacan and sambal or something equivalent and I honestly would buy a bottle from them as would one of the other people I ate dinner with.

Our only appetizer was the Steamed Rice Cake/Bánh Bèo with shrimp, dried shrimp, scallion oil, shallot, garlic & Vietnamese dipping sauce. They gave us some spoons to eat this with. The rice cakes had a slight coconut flavor to them and there was a little bit of plump shrimp. The dish came with four pieces and it was pretty worth it but I have preferred this from other spots.

Best of the main dishes was definitely the Fried Whole Branzino/Cá Chiên Nước Mắm listed as de-boned (branzino) tossed in sweet fish sauce glaze (with) fresh greens & herbs. The dish was presented nicely with the remaining skeleton of the fish on the platter with all of the pieces around the body of the fish with the herbs on the side. The fish was fried perfectly and they clearly got off almost all the fish that they could with only a tad bit of fish near the fin that could be munched on. The fish sauce had light sweetness and it was nice to make wraps with the fresh greens.

The Crab Fried Rice/Cơm Chiên Cua with white lump crab meat, scallion, egg, and jasmine rice was surprisingly good. I'm usually not someone who orders crab fried rice as I tend to find it most restaurants skimp on the crab but this place definitely did not. The rice was well seasoned and there was also a spicy green sauce on the side to add extra flavor. As someone who usually wouldn't recommend this dish, this is an excellent version here.

The Dry Pho Duck with egg noodle, crispy quarter duck, water spinach, shallot, scallion, cilantro, pickled ginger & duck essence gravy was also solid. The egg noodles were nice and the duck while small was crispy. This had a rich tasty sauce and the pickled ginger was a bit unexpected. I would recommend this as a meal for one.

The Duck Tamarind with crispy roasted half duck, tamarind and duck bone reduction, and steamed Ong Choy was pretty tasty. The tamarind sauce was thankfully not too sweet and the duck piece I had was tender. The ong choy/ water spinach was a good choice of vegetable and surprisingly there were a few slices of I believe pomelo on top also which was a fun touch. This was also a tasty duck dish and while I preferred the dry pho, this had more duck.

The Shaking Beef/Bò Lúc Lắc listed as wok tossed American Wagyu cubes (served medium-rare,) with onion and yellow pepper in garlic soy with a watercress-cilantro salad was the weakest dish by a good amount. The meat was very tender but the sauce was a bit lighter than some other places. I have also preferred thicker chunks of meat from some other fancier Vietnamese spots such as the also recently opened Twin Tails in Columbus Circle as they added more texture and there could have been a lot more grilled onions also. 

The flavors here are a tad light even for Vietnamese food but they have some creative fun options here. Particularly good fried branzino and crab fried rice and the duck dishes were not too shabby either. I would go back and likely get a bahn mi even if it pains me at that price point or try one of their other dishes. There's better spots but for fancy places, it is at least better than Madame Vo and the space is wonderful. Upper 3",16/12/2024,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"We got the pomelo salad, papaya salad, and the bun cha hanoi, a dish of meatballs in a garlicky broth that you eat in lettuce wraps (w/ vermacelli, basil, cabbage, and other herbs). Our server Nina, was a sweetheart to tell us that we could order more if we wanted later because the bun cha hanoi would be huge. She was right in that it ended up being the perfect portion. I thought the food we had was delish but had to knock off half a star because the pomelo salad was really sweet. The pomelos were very sweet already so the dressing could've been made slightly more salty and way less sweet for a more balanced flavor.",29/7/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,3,"I still don't understand what brothless pho was and it really didn't blow my mind or look that appetizing. I thought the portions were kind of small given the price point. The interior is beautiful but the food was ok. Personally, I just think I'm not a huge fan of fancy vietnamese hole on the wall type foods.",27/1/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,3,"Their pho is actually not bad, but it is a bit too salty. We ordered the wagyu one so maybe that explains why the broth was also a lot more fatty than normal. Also pouring broth from a kettle to the bowl means that the broth is not as hot as it can be, which sucks. The bone marrow and pate is fun to eat and taste pretty good. Bánh bèo is quite hard, not recommended at all. The sauce for bánh đa is pretty good, like sweet and peanut-y; but there supposed to be pork floss in it but we didn 't taste anything. It's a fun dish to eat, but quite expensive for just 1 rice cracker and sauce. Avocado ice cream is good.",25/1/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,"I haven't been through the reviews to see why La Dong isn't five stars but it gets one from me! La Dong is 5/5 for location, service and food. It is a short walk from union square on 17th street and you are greeted by warm, welcoming hosts immediately. We were dining early on a Friday night so we got a table right away. The place filled up very quickly soon after so I'd imagine there is a wait if you were to come in later. 
We got 2 pho's, one beef, one chicken, a crab fried rice, a Vietnamese coffee and a coconut ice cream for dessert. The staff was kind, gracious and treated us like we were royals. Almost like we were doing them a favor by letting them feed us. The beef pho was superior to the chicken pho, although they both hit the spot on a cold night. The crab fried rice is phenomenal, the rice melts in your mouth, and the flavors do a number on your senses. Washed it all down with a Vietnamese iced coffee which was just the right amount of sweet. It had a malty texture, remarkably close to a bitter dark chocolate milkshake. The coconut ice cream is how coconut ice cream should be, all the time, everywhere. Topped with dry coconut shavings, jelly and a dehydrated banana leather, it was simple and elevated, all in one go. Also, the food comes out fast and they start you off with complementary shrimp crackers.
Will I be back? Hell yeah. Their menu is extensive and we barely scratched the surface this one time.",25/1/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,"Dishes were served expeditiously, with the summer rolls and nem nuong coming lht quickly.  The former had an interesting textural contrast with the rice noodles and crispy skin of a spring roll; the sauce was somewhat tangy instead of the usual peanut sauce.  The branzino was substantial and excellent; it was recommended to eat it wrapped with accompanying noodles.  The wagyu pho had a great broth, but the meat's quality was somewhat obscured by the base and accoutrements.  Decor was great with attractive lighting.  Service was impeccable.",1/12/2024,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"Very solid Vietnamese spot near Union Square. It is a large restaurant with plenty of seating and was decorated nicely. I came here on a Sunday for lunch with my friend and La Dong was not too crowded. I started off with their Coconut Salt Coffee and really enjoyed the balance in flavors though the coffee could've been a bit stronger. They also provided complementary shrimp crackers and chili sauce - the chili was really fragrant and paired well with the dishes too! I ordered the Bun Cha Hanoi and it was plated nicely. However, with all the veggies and noodles on the plate it was a bit messy to eat and think that for the price and ratio, a tad more meat could've been added. Nonetheless, I think it's a great addition to the NYC restaurant scene.",20/1/2025,Food & Beverage
La Dong,5,"La Dong is a modern Vietnamese restaurant just north of Union Square, great for a date or girls night. I regret coming solo because I only got a small sample of a really great menu.

I sat at the bar and ordered the seafood curry, the morning glory, and the mocktail with ginger beer. Everything was excellent - the freshness, the flavors, the portions. I would absolutely eat my meal again without hesitation, and maybe ask for my curry to be more spicy.

Staff are attentive, well organized, fast, and bilingual in English and Viet. Price is good for the neighborhood and the ""colonial"" decor.",16/12/2024,Food & Beverage
La Dong,4,"Celebrating a birthday with a good friend at Vietnamese restaurant, La Dong, near Union Square.

I arrived just before 6pm and the restaurant was empty but within a half hour, there wasn't an empty table in sight.

We started with the Steamed Rice Cake (shrimp, dried shrimp, scallion oil, shallot, garlic & Vietnamese dipping sauce) and Sugarcane Shrimp (shrimp paste loaf on sugarcane skewer red leaf lettuce, fresh herbs & plum sauce), the latter being my least favorite.

For main courses we had Crab Fried Rice (white lump crab meat, scallion, egg, jasmine rice), Chả Cá (grilled whole Branzino marinated in traditional turmeric paste, scallion & dill) and Shaking Beef (grilled Wagyu cubes, onion, yellow pepper in garlic soy & watercress-cilantro salad).

Everything was very flavorful, especially the fish and the crab fried rice.",19/2/2025,Food & Beverage

Got the Iced Vietnamese Coffee - asked for light ice, but got served with tons of ice, but it was good and presentation was pretty. 

Pate & Bone - this was soooooo good and addictive. I would come back just for this. 

Summer roll - nice as well. Wrapping done nicely. 

Beef pho - okay broth wasn't as aromatic as I would hope, bur better than the Vietnamese places you find in Chinatown. Love the sliced garlic and red chilli pepper.

The food came out quickly and the server kept stopping by to check in which was nice. They had a lunch special so I chose the mushroom vegetable soup with pho ha noi. I also added the steam rice cake which wasn't my favorite. But I really enjoyed the mushroom vegetable soup (maybe even better than the pho broth). The pho doesn't come with any fixins or sides like bean sprouts, instead it comes with pickled garlic and chilis. The food is pretty pricey but thought it tasted good.",25/12/2024,Food & Beverage

In terms of food we got the pate & bone to start (bone marrow, pate in a little jar, and some slices of toasted bread). This was good, but I wish they gave us more slices of bread. We also got the beef pho, which I thought was ok (they use wider noodles than you would usually see in pho) - I liked the sliced garlic and red chilis on the side that you could add to the noodles. Lastly, we ordered the bun cha, which was good but I've had better elsewhere in the city - I thought the meat wasn't  very flavorful.

They had a few outages that day, but they were able to work around it and give us other options for the dishes that we ordered. They were kind enough to make sure that we got reimbursed on the parts of the order that they could not fulfill And I will say that all the food that came out was really delicious. I especially really like the burger and the Matcha that I got. The space looks like a diner and service seems really fast and friendly, the owners are from the Neighbourhood and so they have a really good feel and vibe for the place and they also seem to welcome a lot of locals here.

Little Grenjai,3,"Colorful, trendy, cramped space now housing this former takeout/delivery-only darling.

The burger is genuinely unique - it tasted a lot like pad krapow in sandwich form.

""Street style"" pad thai had good flavor but the portion of rice noodles was disappointingly small, and just disproportionate compared to the decent portion for the $5 crispy pork belly add-on. Yes, I know that's the typical portion at a street stall in Thailand. It still feels underwhelming for a $22 dish at a gentrified Brooklyn eatery. Rice noodles barely cost anything, c'mon now.

Also tried the thai tea cake - okay sponge with good thai tea flavor.

Glad I tried it but a bit too out-of-the-way and pricey for the portion size for me to come back.",31/3/2024,Food & Beverage
Little Grenjai,5,"Today was my second time to the restaurant, though the first was for one of their community dinner events before formally opening - so this was my first try of the quickly-becoming-famous smash burger.

The burger was delicious, well cooked, the toppings were great adding nice flavor, and bun was nice.  Just a very well done smash burger.  The potato slices that you can optionally get on the side were also very freshly fried and delicious, I'd recommend adding them.  I got the smash burger without the cheese as I'm an American-cheese-hater, but didn't miss it at all.

I've been having their pad ka prao pork for a couple years, as they used to have a pop-up near me that was my go to.  Honestly it's my favorite pad ka prao in all of Brooklyn, only NYC places that can compete are in Elmhurst Queens.

Both the dinner service at the community table and lunch service were very good.  Lunch is very casual (order at front and find a seat), but pleasant and quick.  Dinner service was more traditional seated restaurant and was high quality.

Ambiance is great, beautifully designed/decorated restaurant.

Highly recommend!",26/4/2024,Food & Beverage

We lucked out, no line no wait for the only thing we came for--the SMASH BURGER. It was worth the wait and the effort of being out in this weather. It was pretty damn good. Melted cheese, spicy and you could definitely taste and smell the basil. Definitely will be back and have food in house as the burger would've been so much better if the egg wasn't cold when we got home. 
The menu is def a lil pricey ($20 for pad Thai with shrimp and $15 for a burger) as I have learned to accept this living in NYC.",23/3/2024,Food & Beverage

Little Grenjai,5,"This place is amazing. Awesome staff. Taking classic Thai dishes and making them really yummy without changing too much. It's not your normal turn and burn Thai place and they didn't open just to start a business, they're passionate about the food. Can be hard to get a table so reserve a day before at least for dinner. Burger is stupendous. Love their grapow and pad thai even. Their Nam Khao Tod (rice ball dish) is done really well. I've had it twice and it was presented differently both times and tasted slightly different but both were amazing. This place feels very chef driven. Nam Khao Tod is A. hard to find because it's a laborious process to make and not very profitable since it's essentially rice. B. When you can find it, it's not always done well because restaurants will find shortcuts to make the cooking process faster. I'm talking about you Night + Market in LA. Their Nam Khao Tod is disgusting and fake. Sorry. So as a Thai/Lao person who grew up eating Nam Khao Tod or just Nam being made by aunties, it always makes me so happy to eat a good version. So thanks Grenjai for killing it! Wish you continued success and I'll keep spreading the word. The chefs and staff are super nice too and will talk to you when you can. Feels like a nice neighborhood addition.

My only gripe is that people will post up at the few tables they have inside for a while, even when they're done eating. I totally understand that these hipsters are enjoying themselves and it's probably their event for the evening, but yeah get to getting! Kop Jai!",15/9/2024,Food & Beverage
Little Grenjai,4,"The smash burger is indeed worth all of the hype! I highly recommend getting it with the fried duck egg - the jammy yolk that inevitably drips everywhere is a fantastic sauce to mop up with any leftover bun. The burger is also a bit spicy, but the spice level is very tolerable. 

The pad thai is really good too and you can order it with your choice of protein. We had it without any protein since it's cooked with egg and tofu and it was delicious on its own.

The burger is only available for lunch so I dropped by on Juneteenth thinking that I would be taking advantage of a slow day for them. Looks like everyone else had the same idea because the place was jam packed! This unfortunately meant that service was incredibly slow. They also bring food out individually, as they are ready, from the kitchen so for our party of three, our food came out about 30 minutes apart.",19/6/2024,Food & Beverage
Little Grenjai,5,"WOW. My husband and I were in NYC for seven days for vacation from CA- hubs lived in NY for 8 years and we were staying with friends in Bed Stuy... I work at a 2 Michelin star restaurant in NorCal and we dined at several starred restaurants in the city and we both agreed our dinner at Little Grenjai was our favorite meal of the trip! 

It's cute and cramped (in the best way) we had a 4 top in the corner, perfect for us. Service was prompt and friendly. Drinks came fast. I ordered multiple small plates from the menu, 2 of the specials, crab rice and the short rib for mains. Honestly I wanted to order everything. 

Plates came out rapid fire one after the other, and we inhaled them. Flavors and textures were complex, spicy enough for me but not too spicy for more timid palates.

Little Grenjai,4,"After a tiring day of traveling from the West Coast, I needed nourishment.  My friend had been wanting to try Little Grenjai, so that's where we went. 

However, the item he looked at was on their lunch menu.  Their dinner menu had different items, but we were not disappointed.  We started with the crispy rice salad, which I loved!  I love sour flavors, so the fermented pork sausage was right up my alley.  The lime dressing added spicy and citrus notes, while the peanuts, toasted coconuts, and crispy rice added a wonderful crunch.  The Thai arancini ball added a different textural sensation of crispness.  I just wish the dish was bigger because I could probably eat their entire stock of it. 

As our main, we got the fried chicken dinner.  I love fried chicken, and the Thai flavors made theirs unique.  My friend was allergic to one of the ingredients in the salad that comes with the chicken, so we were able to substitute it with more crispy rice salad.  So that made me very happy.  And I loved the tamarind dipping sauce, that added a sweet tanginess to the fried chicken. 

Service was excellent!  The staff was very helpful in explaining their concept and menu.  The space is tight and lively.  We sat at the bar, but I feel like you can easily strike up a conversation with the table next to you.  

I would totally come back here again when I'm Bed-Stuy.",18/8/2025,Food & Beverage

The food itself was super flavorful and delicious. It does have a spicy kick but it wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be. I felt it but my tongue wasn't burning or anything.

You come in and are able to sit anywhere you like and then walk up to the counter to order and then your food is brought to you. I opted to sit at the counter facing the open kitchen (we love an open kitchen concept). 

I got the crab rangoon to start and then the krapow smash burger. The rangoons were tasty although there was v little crab and more cream cheese than anything else. I enjoyed the sweet chili sauce that came with it. The burger is what I really came for -- It honestly was one of the more flavorful burgers i've had in a while and that's obvi due to the thai flavors incorporated into the patty. The thai basil and chilies were a nice touch to the burger however I wish the sauce that came on there was a little more. Would I come back for the burger? Possibly. Am I interested in trying their other thai menu items? for sure.",11/1/2025,Food & Beverage
Little Grenjai,4,"A cozy spot with wonderful service and yummy food! 

We ordered the crispy rice salad, pad thai, massaman short rib and sticky rice sundae. tl;dr:
Crispy rice salad - yes
Massaman short rib - yes
Pad Thai - no
Sticky rice sundae - yes

My favorite was definitely the short rib and we saw a lot of short rib orders being made that night (we sat at the counter which looks directly into the kitchen). Crispy rice salad was delicious as well. 

I was most looking forward to the pad Thai because it was so hyped on the website, but it wasn't my favorite. The noodle texture was a soft and sauced pad thai, but the other ingredients got lost in the noodles and sauce so you couldn't really taste or distinguish them. I felt there was only one wet/soft texture and one predominant flavor. If you're picking carbs, I'd suggest the crab fried rice instead -- we saw a lot being prepared and it looked good. 

The sundae was tasty and different because of the sticky rice flavor and salted peanuts -- that gave it nice varying textures and tastes. However, it was not my personal favorite but it was very good. It was tough not comparing it to Thai Diner's coconut sundae (though they're different) because I recently had it. My companion loved it.

We tried the smashburger with fries, and drunken noodles with cracklin pork belly. They were out of their Thai tea so didn't get to try. The smashburger wasn't too greasy with the pickled veggies and we enjoyed the blend of pork and beef. It was missing a bit more sauce imo, could've been a creamier sauce since it wasn't too greasy. Their drunken noodles are actually pretty spicy!!! They were on the greasy side but veryyyy well flavored. The cracklin pork belly was also crispy and yummy.

I saw this place on TikTok and wanted to give it a try. I went on a date and it wasn't too hard to get a reservation. The staff was very friendly but it is a small spot. I like how kitschy it seems. We had an early dinner and had the following: 

- Peek Gai Tod Wings 5/5: soo good 
- Khan Soi Duck 4/5: tasty but not the most amazing dish 
- Pad Thai pork belly: 3/5 I wanted this to be so good but I thought it was just okay. I do have a high standard for pad Thai bc I've been to Asia before. But idk. Something was missing here. 

I def want to go back and try some of the curries. Recommend giving it a try!",25/8/2024,Food & Beverage
Little Grenjai,3,"I was excited to try this place because I've been following them online and waiting for them to open. The inside is cramped; I believe it's a converted Chinese takeout spot and it can get uncomfortably crowded very fast. You have to order at the register and then they bring your food to you. I ordered the burger, which is what they're known for, with a side of fries and my partner had the drunken noodles. I thought the burger was OK; I expected it to have a spicy kick and to be favorable but it was missing both of those things. I had them add the Thai fried egg on top, which was fine. The only interesting part of the meal was the fries. They make them like the Lay's ruffled potato chips; they're crispy around the edges but soft in the middle. Very cool. The prices here are OK.",7/5/2024,Food & Beverage
Little Grenjai,4,"This place is very small and gets packed quickly, yet I really like the setup. I highly recommend finding seating first if you decide to dine in, bc seats will go very quickly. After you sit and choose your food selection, make sure you save your seat then get up to order. Then just sit back and wait for the goodies to arrive. The staff was super sweet and handled the crowd well. I appreciated their calm demeanor amidst the crazy, but they are used to it I'm sure. 

We split the burger and the wings and they were tasty. Next time I'd like to try the pad Thai the pork belly and a few other options but overall. Little Grenjai is definitely a must try. It gets busy tho so be prepared lol.",17/4/2024,Food & Beverage
Little Grenjai,4,"Alright so I've seen a lot of press on the burger, it's all over the internet and I love burgers so had to come by before it gets more popular. The location is small, very casual, lots of hipsters. I parked across the street on a Saturday afternoon. Walked in with my wife and 2yr old and stroller had to be parked in front. No problem, we sit at the booth my 2 yr is going crazy, touching everything, tapping people at the bar. Probably leave the baby at home. Anyways ordered the burger, made it a double and added the duck egg, got the pad thai with pork cracklin and drunken noodles. The pad thai was amazing, the portion was a little small in my opinion. The drunken noodles were spicy, not like Buffalo wings spicy like thai chillies spicy. If you enjoy spice this is such a great dish, full of flavor. Now the show stopper! The Burger! Wow, first bite you taste the marinated patty. It's strong flavors are well balanced with thai basil, their version of giardiniera and the unctuous egg that drips down the side of your mouth and the side of your hand. It was my favorite dish and have been thinking of is for the past 2 days. I can't wait to go back, will probably get the burger for sure and maybe try their different sides. This place opened Feb 2024 and is already picking up a lot of buzz. Go try the burger, judge for yourself",13/10/2024,Food & Beverage
Little Grenjai,5,"This is simply a 5 star experience. 

Not sure why the average is like 4, people are haters. 

I came for the smash burger, my taste buds were smashed.

Size, flavor, spice, 10/10

Thai iced tea 9/10 

Ambiance, service, music, design 10/10

Warning* if you're not used to Thai/asian spice it can be a lot but I thought it was just right",22/12/2024,Food & Beverage
Little Grenjai,5,This is a restaurant where you order in the front and then grab a number and sit down it is a relatively small place. But the dishes were amazing. The crab Rangoon was a flavor that I've never really had before. The drunken noodle was spicier than I expected but it still tasted amazing would definitely recommend others! The minced pork holy basil was pretty amazing but didn't end up finishing the rice.,8/11/2024,Food & Beverage

Little Grenjai,5,I absolutely loved my burger and drunken noodles. Wow! That burger is incredible.  The noodles were also great. Spicy! Love it!,9/3/2025,Food & Beverage
Little Grenjai,4,"Welcome Little Grenjai to the neighborhood. The space is brightly lit with lots of daylight, with a modern retro interior, with diner style tables and seats. Staff is friendly but the layout is a little awkward due to the counter service ordering from the coffee bar instead of the front counter, so cramped lines form inbetween tables.

Their Krapow Smashburger is a fantastic take on a smashburger by adding a flair of thai flavors throughout. Chili infused beef patty, american cheese, pickled vegetables (incl. carrots, peppers, and cauliflower!), thai holy basil, and a shrimp-based sauce. This burger is unlike any other burger and tastes like it came right from the streets of Thailand.

Peek Gai Tod fried chicken is good with a great blend of seasoning and marinade. The exterior was nice and crispy with the chicken still tender, albeit slightly oiley. The burgers came out first whereas I had to ask about the chicken since I wasn't sure if it was forgotten about or not. Strange to have the apps come after the mains but since they're brand new they're likely just trying to find the right pacing in the kitchen.

Knock on the menu variety and pricing. The small yet wide variety of dishes seems like it would overwhelm the kitchen and some items are way overpriced (ie. congee is $14 with pork being a $4 add-on). They have a wide variety of beer and wine being served but no coffees or teas despite there being an espresso machine at the coffee bar?

Would love to come back for dinner service or their monthly Tender Bits pop-up as it looks like an awesome experience.",4/2/2024,Food & Beverage
Little Grenjai,3,"I had really high expectations for Grenjai after not only seeing tons of social posts about it, and also having a fellow Yelp Eliter recommend the burger to me. Sadly my experience fell flat.

The setup/layout is a bit interesting. You have to walk in between tables to the counter to place your order. It wasn't that busy when I was there, but i could see this being a bit awkward and cramped when it's busy.

When I walked up to the counter the person there was texting or scrolling on their phone. I had to speak before being acknowledged. They quickly apologized and were friendly, as was the other person that brought our food. 

My friend and I ended up ordering the wings, burger, fries, and the minced pork over rice.

- Wings: Soggy. I wish they were still crispy. The sauce only partially coated a few of them and just felt like the flavors hadn't fully melded. I ended up having leftovers, which I airfried the next day and enjoyed a lot more.

- Smash burger: one thing about a smashburger that I love, are those crispy bits that you get form the thin patty. This just didn't have that. Also, the flavor was just pretty flat. It just tasted... spicy. I was expecting more of a flavor explosion, but it just didn't happen. 

- Minced pork: It was really dry. My friend suggested we try it with some of the sauce that came with the wings, and we both found it more enjoyable. We saw others had ordered theirs with an egg, and had we known, we would have done the same. I think the egg would've made for a more memorable dish.

- Fries: Despite having a sensitivity to potatoes, I had to try these lol. They were my favorite part of the meal! I love the cut of these fries--like wavy potato chips.

I'm going to try them again soon for dinner. Hopefully that experience will be a bit different.",30/3/2024,Food & Beverage
Little Grenjai,5,I ordered pick up from Little Grenjai and it was very delicious! I got their smash burger. Their team is so nice and it was busy inn there but looked like a cool diner vibe. Would love to go back and sit down.,10/2/2025,Food & Beverage
Little Grenjai,5,I've now been for dinner twice and lunch once. The lunch burger is incredible! Jockeying for a seat during lunch was very stressful. You order at the counter and seats are first come first serve. There is not much seating. Dinner is easier -- just make a reservation. The service is always top notch and all the dishes I have ordered are always incredible. Great natural wine. The decor is cute -- not formal.,12/12/2024,Food & Beverage
Little Grenjai,4,We shared the krapow smash burger. The toppings shine on this burger. Great crunch and acidity coming from the pickled veggies. Peppery and spicy sauce guaranteed to make you reach for at least one tissue. Nostalgic sesame seed bun. I believe the patty was a chicken or pork based blend. Service was ultra quick.,30/3/2024,Food & Beverage
Little Grenjai,5,"This place is the bomb! Have only been once, at lunch, for the famous burger but it definitely lives up to the hype! I got a double patty version and it did the trick. I was full! Nice char, low heat, delicious burger.  Can't wait to come back and try the wings; the pad Thai and everything else.  Though I'm a little scared to come back for dinner because I'm sure it will be mobbed with a long wait. The owner who works check out is super sweet and the decor is fun and funky. Also, their merch is cool!",9/5/2024,Food & Beverage
Little Grenjai,1,Wasn't a fan of their smash burger. Stools and a few tables available for seating--Somewhat cramped though.,22/8/2024,Food & Beverage
Little Grenjai,3,"We went during dinner, thinking they would have the smashburger. Found out that's only during lunch! Instead, we got the leek dip and drunken noodles. Leek dip was great but the noodles were nothing special. The tofu we got was just on top of the noodles- it was just okay. Wouldn't go back for dinner, but would come back just to try the burger",23/2/2025,Food & Beverage
Little Grenjai,2,"I came here with my friends and high hopes. First off, the vibes are very cute and thoughtful -- everything from the tin cups to the curtains. The restaurant is very, very small. We made reservations and would recommend that. I ordered the Drunken Noodle with Tofu and was really disappointed. It tasted burned, like the fish sauce was over-caramelized, and pretty salty. The Green Papaya Salad we ordered for the table was pretty tasty though. I'm not sure I'd come here again.",15/8/2024,Food & Beverage
Little Grenjai,2,"You should know before you walk in the things that seem vegetarian are not actually vegetarian. All the noodles except Drunken Noodles have a fish sauce base and we were told it couldn't be made without it. So we got 2 out of the total 3 vegetarian things on the menu: brussel sprouts and drunken noodles with tofu puffs. However, they tried convincing us to get the cabbage instead of the brussels (was later wondering if this was bc the brussels or d noodles were also based in fish sauce and they didn't share that) and literally brought us that instead even after we very much declined and then said they accidentally wrote it down (?) Huh? But eventually got our order right. 
Their tofu puffs, respectfully, are a waste of space. Felt like I was biting into air, had no flavor at all. The drunken noodles by themselves were good and the brussel sprouts were decent but after having delicious b-sprouts at another spot the night before this was an embarrassment for this place. Also, if you like your drunken noodles spicy, this isn't the spot for you. It had no spice, they just added peppers on the side. I would not return unless they upgraded their menu to be more vegetarian and vegan friendly and had better service but glad I tried this new spot by my apt so I can at least confirm it was a bad idea! It's always crowded for dinner but it was pretty empty for lunch which made sense after trying it.

UPDATE- after reading Alex L.'s review below where they state they were told the Brussel sprouts were also based in fish sauce ... I'm in shock. BEYOND unprofessional and (quite frankly should be illegal?) of their staff to lie to us when we made it extremely clear we are vegetarian and wouldn't eat anything based in fish sauce. I guess that's why they asked if it was an allergy (we said no) so if it's not allergy I guess they don't care.",31/3/2024,Food & Beverage
Little Grenjai,3,The food was calm. I went in to order take out the guy originally said 15-20 minutes but I ended up waiting 49. On top of that they had forgot the cake I ordered and they don't have a phone number to call so I had to email them about that they ain't respond tho. A lot of wait and misfortune for food that was just okay. Looked like a cute date spot tho,1/2/2025,Food & Beverage
Little Grenjai,2,Don't go out of your way for this place. Couldn't try the burger as its only available at lunch. Had some hope for the Thai cake but was totally forgettable. Smallest cocktail I've ever seen. WAY overpriced. $7 for a tiny piece of pork to be added on. If the price was reasonable I'd give it three stars as the taste overall is nothing special.,13/12/2024,Food & Beverage
Little Grenjai,3,"Smash burger was really great. Thai iced tea was generic but fine. I enjoyed the minced pork stir fry, but I wouldn't say it was stellar. Even though overall the fuss didn't knock me out, it was good enough that I would come here again. Decor is adorable and the overall vibe is cute but the server we had does not like his job or the customers and didn't feel like faking it. It's a bummer to pay for a meal and be made to feel uncomfortable.",6/11/2024,Food & Beverage
Little Grenjai,5,Look most would as for the burgers to be an all day ordeal. But when I came by the restaurant the ambiance was a little tight but very bright. People ordering food the smells of the kitchen almost tell you what comes out next. Will definitely reserve a group planning next time I come. Service was swift and pleasant and I only waited for my food to go for about 15 minutes. I got the wings and the crab Rangoon just to try and it definitely a reason I come back,5/5/2024,Food & Beverage
Little Grenjai,5,Amazing little restaurant with great food and service. The space is designed very well and is very welcoming. The burger is worth the hype and the minced pork is a must order. We will stop by anytime we're in the neighborhood for sure.,24/8/2024,Food & Beverage

Little Grenjai,3,"Not great for vegetarians looking to avoid fishy flavors.  I am vegetarian and realize that most Thai uses fish sauce for many dishes.  I asked about if they included fish sauce in their brussel sprouts dish and they said they do.  I said don't worry about it but they put some sauce on the side anyway.  I was prepared to eat the dish the way it is usually prepared but instead it came out separated.  I think this accounted for the dish tasting dry and a bit boring.  The added tofu puffs probably needed something to make them not taste like paper.  I should not have said anything.  That being said, both the desserts were amazing.  The coconut pie and Thai ice tea cake were so good.  I also had a delicious beer.  Maybe next time I will try and order the dish normally as my partner loved her meal.",24/2/2024,Food & Beverage
Little Grenjai,3,The burger is something special. Its delicious. But the crab rangoon I ordered was over top salty. Like little salt bombs. This is why I gave only 3 stars.,24/2/2024,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"Raku is legitimately one of those restaurants that gives you a new perspective on the dish it specializes in. The first time I had it my mind was blown away by how bouncy they could make their udon and this time was no different.

We started off with the Atsugiri bacon which was perfectly cooked and super succulent. Then I got the niku udon and once again was amazed at just how springy they could make the noodles while still being able to latch onto the sweet and savory niku broth.

If you haven't had Raku yet it's definitely somewhere I think is a must try just by how unique their udon texture is.",28/5/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,3,"service - below average.. didn't check on us nor refill our water yet they wanted 20% minimum tip.. 

food - flavorful and comforting 

ambiance - causal",19/7/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,3,"Didn't have a reservation here on a Tuesday night around 6:30 PM, but didn't wait more than 15 minutes for a party of 4. The restaurant is quite small with no more than 25 people seated at any point. The pricing is fine, you'll spend $20-30 bucks per entree and the serving sizes are pretty average. You probably won't leave hungry, but you certainly won't leave stuffed.

Gyunan (3/5): I honestly don't think I understood the hype. My favorite part about eating any kind of noodle is the bounce, the satisfying chew. Their noodles were overcooked in my opinion and just turned into mush in yourself. The flavors of the broth were light, but the toppings are sparse and just okay. Not sure if it was just an off day, but I definitely wouldn't go out of my way for this.",18/7/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,4,"My second time at @rakunyc and I enjoyed my cold zaru udon a lot more than the hot udon I've had last time! Got an add-on veggie tempura but sadly they were not hot anymore when they came to me.

Had a bite of the buta shabu and I liked the grilled flavors of the sliced pork a lot!",1/5/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"Their udon are still as delicious as ever! I ordered my usual spicy niku udon & my sister got the yasai (vegetable) udon + vegetable tempura. The spicy niku udon was still consistently delicious (every time I eat it). The vegetable udon broth was so light + savory and amazing! The vegetable tempura were excellent as well - crunchy and not oily, and well seasoned.

Excellent staff + food! This is still my most favorite udon place in NYC.

Love that they give you frozen grapes as a complimentary dessert - delish!",23/3/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"Probably the best bowl of udon I've ever had. When I came in, I already had dinner--but I went to socialize with friends&order an appetizer and could not resist. With the white walls, wooden furniture, and simple decor, the place had a peaceful vibe. I split the tantan udon with someone else, and since I was full, I was glad I did--the portions were great. The noodles themselves were fantastic--they tasted so fresh and were thinner than typical udon. The broth was spicy and flavorful. I have no notes. Service was good. I highly recommend for a delicious and pleasant meal.",27/6/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"I finally took the dive with Raku on a cold winter's night and came away super satisfied. 

You can set a reservation for Raku, but I came in as a walk-in right as they opened Sunday for lunch and was about third in line. It was super cold that day, but one of the servers was super nice in bringing hot tea to everyone waiting. 

I was able to get a bar seat as a solo diner. After asking the server about the menu, I ended up ordering:

*Green tea: Solid and straightforward
*Zaru udon with shrimp tempura: I thought this might be too small for myself, but the server told me it would fill me up. She was right! Loved the udon quality. And it came with a bunch of tempura - shiso leaf tempuras, the shrimp tempuras, and a fish tempura. The udon dipping sauce was also fantastic. Loved the mix of quail egg and mushrooms/green onions. It was filling! 

The food came out pretty quickly and overall was solid. Service was great. Totally would come back.",4/3/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"I love Japanese and this is deliciously Japanese. It's a tiny, unassuming door that leads into a beautiful restaurant. The food comes out fast. My favorite was the shishito peppers. We got lots of apps and then a soup. It was all delicious. Service was friendly and very attentive. Two thumbs up.",20/6/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"I've been wanting to try Raku forever and was so glad to finally make it in with friends! I ordered the Sansai Udon and was so impressed. The noodles were incredibly chewy and bouncy- unlike anything I've had before.. and the broth was light, refreshing, and packed full of flavor. The maitake mushroom added a rich, earthy depth that tied the flavors together so nicely. 

Great service- friendly and attentive without being overbearing, and the interior is absolutely gorgeous: modern, clean, and thoughtfully designed. Our location also had a cafe at the front and my only regret is not grabbing a dessert to go (still thinking about the hojicha panna cotta and soba pudding...). 

Reservations recommended. We made ours a few days in advance for lunch and were glad we did- the places definitely starts filling up during peak hours. Would definitely visit again!",18/6/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,4,"An amazing, cozy restaurant if you're looking for noodle soup--and a must-try, even during the summer! Their udon noodles are unlike any other--perfectly chewy and delightfully bouncy. The broth is incredibly savory, bursting with umami flavors, and pairs perfectly with your order (like the shrimp tempura in their ebi udon!).

Though Raku may get packed at times, that just speaks to how good the food is. The ambiance is warm and welcoming, making you feel as if you're truly in Japan. This is a must-try if you're in the city--and they even end your meal with complimentary frozen grapes!",16/6/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"Cozy and intimate with only 26 seats. Came on a Friday at 4 PM--no wait or reservation needed.

The best part? Their udon noodles--so chewy, bouncy, and perfectly al dente. Raku's chewiness is on another level. Their broths are above average, but nothing special. A complimentary frozen grape to end your meal. 

*Niku Udon $28 | 9.5/10: Tender meat, similar to Taiwanese beef noodle soup. The honeycomb tripe was excellent, and the broth had a deep, beefy flavor
*Toriten Udon $21 | 9/10: Dashi broth with crispy, juicy fried chicken served on the side. The chicken was great but could benefit from a stronger marinade",26/3/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,Arrived in a 19-person group for a work event. We took over 3 tables that sat 6 people each and 1 person pulled up a chair. The staff were really patient and efficient with us. The only appetizer that's gluten free is the bacon. I got a beef rice bowl as they can make that gluten free and it had a ton of rice. They also have the togarashi seasoning to give your food an extra kick.,15/6/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,4,"my friends are obsessed to the point they go every time they're in town. tourists find it life changing... i get why, bc the noodles are super chewy and the broth is so rich and hearty. i do wish it was a little more affordable but worth trying for everyone ! try the niku",3/8/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,3,"Went here for the first time last night after seeing it on tik tok. The atmosphere was really cute and the restaurant was full. We made a resy as it was 730 on Thursday night. 

The staff was very attentive and we did not wait long. 

We started off with the pork gyoza. It was the best thing of the meal. Everything came out steaming hot. We then got the gyunan ribeye hot udon and the sansai hot udon. Both were decent. The meat was well cooked however the broth tasted like hot water. It lacked a lot of flavor. The udon itself though was good.

The pricing is also pretty reasonable for this cuisine in the city. 

I don't think I would return as I was underwhelmed and expected a lot more flavor. There are much better spots.",30/5/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"Food: The udon is amazing here! My favorite part is the noodle texture. Noodles are perfectly silky and bouncy. It's much better than the udon you typically have in restaurants. My favorite udon here is the tantan which I highly recommend. The beef udon and curry udon are great also, but tantan is a must-get. The monk fish liver appetizer is also very good. I didn't find anything special about the eggplant appetizer though. The quality of food here reminds me of Japan.

Service: Service is excellent here. Staff are friendly and attentive.

Ambiance: I've been to both the West Village and East Village locations. The East Village location is very small and seating is tight whereas the seating is more comfortable at the other location. Overall ambiance is great at both locations though. 

Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant!",16/3/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,My favorite udon spot in NYC. I came here for lunch on a Tuesday and got the seated pretty quickly. I ordered the jaja udon which was a cold udon. This is my first time trying cold udon at Raku and it did mot disappoint. The noodles was chewy and delicious. There was a big pork meat ball which I mixed in with the noodle that gave it a bit of a spice. It was a great dish for a hot summer day.,5/6/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"Winter is around the corner, and I find myself craving for hot soup and noodles more often. I was impressed by Raku's cold dipping udon last time, but their warm udon is EVEN BETTER! I almost drank up the entire bowl of hot soup. 

We went to their East Village location, which was much smaller and more cramped than the other locations. I highly recommend making a res to avoid the wait (yes, there's a wait even on weekdays!)

＊Gyunan Udon 牛南うどん $21
If you don't want to splurge on their wagyu udon ($35 for American Mishima or $42 for Japanese A5 Miyazaki beef), gyunan would be the perfect choice. The beef was so tender and juicy that I enjoyed every bite of it. It almost melted in my mouth. Compared to wagyu, prime beef was less heavy and had a lower fat ratio. 

How could they keep the chewiness and bounciness while serving the udon in hot broth!? I am usually picky about udon soup's texture, but this one ticked every box. 

Let's talk about the soup -- it looked clear but it was actually bursting with flavor. It gave me enough warmth and coziness.",5/12/2024,Food & Beverage
Raku,3,"Made a reservation on a weekday for a party of 4. We were excited to try the udon after hearing a lot about this place. The udon is super tasty and has a good texture to it. The soup is hearty and they have a good variety of options to choose from on their menu, including hot or cold udon. The area is pretty small but nice in the inside. Aside from the food, our server kept rushing us to order and also clearing our bowls towards the end. We were only there for one hour total but in less than 10 minutes, the server came back to us twice asking us if we were ready to order when we let them know we needed a little more time the first time they came around. Same thing at the end, they kept asking us if we were done with our bowls when we were still finishing up.",2/5/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,4,"We had a reservation at 5:30pm on a Sunday and though the other guests in my party were running late, they sat me down right away and were very understanding, which I greatly appreciated.

I started off with the hot organic green tea, which warmed me up right away from the frigid walk to the restaurant. For starters, we ordered the Sabazushi (three mackerel pressed sushi) and Chawanmushi (steamed egg). The sushi was nicely made as both the fish and rice were fresh. The egg was silky and well seasoned. They were also generous with the seafood and toppings. 

For entrees, I ordered the Toriten Udon (four marinated fried chicken) and the other guests ordered the Kamonan Udon (LI duck breast, Tokyo negi). For the Toriten, I asked for the chicken to be on the side and I'm glad I did because the chicken was crispy and juicy and I enjoyed eating it with the chili powder. The udon and broth were simple, but made very well - one of the best in the city! The udon was bouncy and chewy in the best way possible and the broth was well flavored.",11/2/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,4,"Small spot in the East Village, great place to grab lunch solo. The udon noodles are perfect. Spicy niku is just the right level of spicy. A little pricey but big portions",16/4/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"I'm a big fan of raku udon! I live on the west coast and when I visit my boyfriend who lives on the East coast I always request to go to raku. It's quite literally the best udon I have ever had. All their dishes are so flavorful, the udon has the perfect chew, the broth (no matter what you get) is always so delicious, and the appetizers are always great! 
The service is spectacular as well, very tentative and kind. I've never had a bad experience when going! The inside is kind of small, but it has a very nice vibe.",6/2/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"Usually not a huge udon fan, but Raku converted me. Their noodles were super bouncy and flavorful, both key characteristics of good udon. 

Although the hot udons on their menu seem simple, the broth is packed with flavor. Their portions are also humongous. You definitely get what you pay for. I highly recommend!",17/1/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"Excellent Service. Nice ambiance on the bar side. I forgot to take a picture of the actual udon, but it was super good. The texture was the perfect level of chewy and the there was a perfect amount. The food was also reasonably priced. The agedashi tofu was also yummy.

Overall I'd recommend this place.",9/1/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"Raku is a bit of an institution at this point, one of the best udon spots in NYC for quite some time and really has grown over the years. I first came when they were a small spot, before they expanded and added another location, and came back a second time after the expansion. The udon noodles are super flavorful, and they're doing some modern and creative twists to some of their dishes. The bacon dish which is essentially a giant slab of pork belly is a winner, although out of the 2 times I've had it, it was a bit on the drier side, but when it hits it hits. The curry and wagyu udon were also quite delicious, and I would recommend this place as one of the best udon places in NYC, not that we have tooooo many in manhattan. 

The space is well lit, lively, and energetic. Give it a try!",4/1/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,4,"Perfect on a cold day, especially if you want a quieter, more peaceful dining experience. This location is easy to miss as the doors are right in the wall, but there were people waiting outside which helped. My friends and I came by on a Thursday night and the wait was 45 minutes for three people, so we wandered around until we got a text. We opted for bar seating as it would get us in sooner and it was still a good experience (except for the bursts of cold air as the door opened/closed)!

I ordered the kamonan udon (duck) and it was delicious, hearty with a strong duck flavor, maybe a little salty for me towards the end. The noodles are nice and chewy, and the duck was perfectly cooked. It was a large serving, which could serve as two meals if noodle dishes traveled well enough for that. I will say I wish the udon dishes here came with more default toppings than just the protein and green onions, but oh well.",3/1/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"Had the Niku udon which included beef short ribs and honeycomb tripe.  It was delicious. The broth was flavorful and the udon was perfectly cooked, nice and springy.  Would love to come back and try their other dishes.",20/4/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,4,"I only managed to snap photos of the drinks, but the udon here is absolutely delicious! I always order the ebiten which is tempura with udon, and it's always good every time I come here. The broth is light & delicious, and the noodles are perfectly chewy. The iced matcha & barley tea complimented very well with the noodle dishes, and the food is so good overall! The service is quick, although it does take some time for the food to come out. I always recommend my friends to come here if you're craving udon!!",13/4/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"Yes yes yes. Highly recommended by many folks. I didn't expect much but it was DELICIOUS. 

We did a long day of walking and shopping and decided to try to come here without a reservation. It was a Tuesday around 3? Luckily no wait, sat right away. WHOO

We ordered
cucumber salad - could have skipped this. It was alright, nothing special.
kani-maze - WWOWOWOW So flavorful, the udon was the perfect chewy texture. All the toppings were nice together. I could have done another portion of noodles or at least half a portion to add to the leftover sauce. YUM
kamonan - duck udon - simple but very flavorful. 
the two dishes complimented each other very well. 

Overall quite happy with the meal, ""pricey"" udon but it was really good. Definitely would come again to try more on the menu!!",19/11/2024,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"Highly recommend for yummy udon! Service was excellent and the outdoor seating was spacious, the interior was a little crowded. Sit outside if you want personal space

The noodles were fresh and chewy. The broth was so flavorful and earthy. I added chili oil and en egg which really enhanced it 

The star of our meal was the fried chicken with the spicy sauce. It was spectacular.

The salad was a perfect crispy autumnal crunch with peanuts and squash. It was lovely

Raku,5,"Best udon in the city... hands down

Here is what you should know:
1. The wait isn't as bad as you might expect. It tends to move quickly and the food is absolutely worth it. 
2. Portion size is a little smaller
3. It is a tiny space.. recommend going in a group no bigger than four
4. The pressed mackerel is the best appetizer
5. Ask for the seasonal special",28/9/2024,Food & Beverage
Raku,4,"Came here for lunch right when they opened and there were already a few people in line. The inside is small and they've squeezed in a lot of tables. We were seated and after we ordered our food came out quickly. 
I got the kitsune udon. The udon noodles were so chewy and cooked perfectly. The broth was flavorful and I liked the tofu skin. I don't think it was anything too special besides the noodles, but maybe it's because I only got the kitsune udon. The other items sounded interesting, so I'll go back to try those!",29/7/2024,Food & Beverage
Raku,4,"We came on a Friday evening and only counter seats were available inside so we opted to sit outside. We tried the Chicken Tatsuta-Age, Ankimo, Buta shabu, and hojun. Chicken Tatsuta-Age was ok, I wouldn't get it again. Hojun is a yuzu fruit sake: it was good, but tasted more like yuzu/citrus than sake (I wouldn't be able to tell its sake!). The udon was great: soft and chewy. The sesame dipping sauce for the buta shabu was flavorful and light, but the pork belly was ok in my opinion. You can dip the noodles into the sauce cup, or just pour the sauce in the plate. I would get this again.

This location takes credit card.",29/7/2024,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"This spot is incredible. We put our names down on the waitlist on a Saturday night and had to wait about 1 hour. We came back and had to wait for our table to be set up and they even gave us hot tea while we were outside. When we got in there are intimate booths set up that is perfect for a small group or a date. I was recommended the Niku udon and it was absolutely delicious. The beef was perfectly cooked, and the broth was hearty. I also got a side of the vegetable tempura which was perfectly fried. I cannot wait to come back on a cold day.",13/3/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,4,"I'd say not your typical udon shop but the noodles here have a QQ I have never had anywhere else for sure. Seating is a bit cramped so be prepared to listen to other people's conversations.

Niku udon - I loved the qq noodles in this, the short braised rib was soft and tender but the soup reminded me of a Taiwanese beef noodle soup especially after you add the spicy sauce. It was good but definitely not your typical udon, at least for me. I'd try something else next time.

Buta shabu - I don't typically order cold noodles but it was 90 degrees when we visited and the table next to us each person had one of these so it had to be good. The noodles on this were different from the soup udon since they were flat, the goma (peanut) sauce was delicious and light. The thinly sliced pork belly had a little char to each piece which made this dish so easy to slurp down on a hot day. This was definitely a nice change and I'd easily order this again. 

It was pretty good overall. I'd come back again.",23/7/2024,Food & Beverage
Raku,4,"Service: 4/5
Food: 4.5/5
Ambiance: casual, quiet but not silent

Surprisingly no ridiculous line out the door, especially with all the hype it gets on social media. Got seated immediately (outside, no complaints tho since it was a nice day). Food is not incredibly unique or mind-blowing, just a place that does simple things really well.
Menu is still a bit overwhelming with the number of options though. I think the noodles are made in-house + by hand, which makes all the difference. Good length with the perfect amount of chew. Portions look intimidating, but are actually just the right amount. Will come back to try their cold dipping noodles, donburis + to check out the inside.

What I Ordered:
- Ebiten Udon: nice light broth. came w 2 shrimp + 1 eggplant tempura.
- Gyunan Udon: flavorful broth without being salty. good amount of meat.",8/9/2024,Food & Beverage
Raku,4,"Heard about this place so we definitely had to check it out. It was Tuesday around 8:00 PM and the wait was still around 45min - 1hr. It was also POURING but there was a little hut on the street right outside the restaurant that we ended up sitting at.

The place is really quaint and cozy, perfect for the rainy weather. We received service almost right away and was able to put orders in. 

Kamonan: I loveee duck so this was definitely the udon for me! They had good amounts of meat. The udon also came out at a perfect temperature. It wasn't too hot where I was blowing on it forever but it wasn't cold... just a good amount. 
Chicken Tatsuta-age: a little too citrusy for my taste which was surprisingly because I only heard good things about it!

Overall, would probably come back to try one of the other delicious udons they have! A smidge overhyped but it was reallllyyy good.",23/8/2024,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"Raku, An Udon Shop on NYC's ""Curry Lane""

Despite the heat of a July summer day in New York, I still opted to have hot udon. Among the several options, I went for a smoked herring- based soup that was phenomenally layered with flavors. The udon noodle was silky smooth. The karaage was delightfully light, crunchy and perfect with the accompanying fish roe mayo. I also ordered a yuzu-based cocktail drink along with the trio of cold side dishes -- burdock, spinach and hijiki -- that provided quick relief from the heat of the udon and searing weather. 

Although the place was rather claustrophobic for the teeny-bit of windowless and dark indoor space, the place was filled up quickly by guests who didn't seem to mind. The overflow guests were ushered at the outdoor space, a semi-permanent structure by the street that was built right after the pandemic. The udon restaurant also has two branches located in Midtown and Greenwich Village. 

This Raku branch is located in a block on 6th Street between First and Second Avenues in Lower East Side that's nicknamed the ""Curry Lane""  or ""Curry Lane"" as it has become the destination for curry-inspired Asian food since the late 60s. 

Raku is not on any swanky critic's list like the Michelin guide, but the affordable food was elegant, authentic and made from high quality ingredients. This will be on my permanent list of favorites.

Raku,3,"Service was great, the staff is super attentive and didn't rush us at all. However, the food wasn't as good as the Toronto location that I've been to. There's hardly any meat, maybe about a spoon of ground pork and the soup didn't really taste strong of peanut. The chicken karaage was good. The buta shabu was not too bad but not as good as the one I had in Toronto.",4/1/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"Raku takes comfort food to the highest level! I love a good noodle soup on any day and raku has some of the best udon I have ever tried. We ordered the salmon oshizushi as an appetizer and the salmon was super fresh and tasted delicious. I love the salmon roe on top for extra taste. I ordered the gyunan udon and it was so yummy, the broth was perfect, the meats inside were so soft and tender and the udon's texture is perfectly chewy and not soggy. The portion was also huge! So it is great value.

When my friends and I got here around 7:30pm on a Saturday there was quite the wait, it was about an hour and they said they would message us when our table is ready so we just went to a nearby bar to grab drinks before we were seated for our meal.",17/8/2024,Food & Beverage
Raku,4,"I came on a snowy weekday and was immediately seated - and there were a lot of empty tables (a nice change from dinnertime when you usually need to wait a whole hour). I typically go to the Soho location but this was my first time at the East Village one. This location is a lot smaller and homier!

The udon was pretty similar in quality though I thought it was a little less el dente than the soho location. The donbori was actually way better here - the meat was more tender and I thought the sauce to rice ratio was perfect (I thought it was too much rice at the soho location). Definitely get the agedashi tofu - this is actually my favorite thing here and I love the bonito flakes and sauce they pair it with.

Solid classic as always.",31/12/2024,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"*I would give a 4.3/5 but thought it would be fair to give 5 on yelp

Raku is one of the top udon places in New York and I have visited the Soho location before. I decided to try the East Village location because I thought it would be bigger (it is not) and I really enjoy the udon. I went as a walk in for 2 around 8 and was told there was a 45 minute wait. We put our names down and went across the street to get a drink while we waited. The host texts us 4 minutes after we put our name down and it said we had 10 minutes to confirm so I confirmed but we didn't get back until 15-20 after we had confirmed since we needed to close out at the bar. It said our table was released but I decided to go up to the host anyways and let her know we got texted so we could try to get the next available table. Immediately she looks down at the iPad and makes a smirking face and proceeds to tell us what we did isn't allowed and she decided to do us a favor and give us an open table but if we're going to go somewhere else while we wait we have to be back in time. I understand they didn't need to save our table but she was pretty rude in the way she communicated it and could've been nicer. This hostess definitely left a bad impression since we didn't expect them to save the table even though they were 40 minutes off on the wait estimate, and she acted weirdly annoyed at us.

Despite this, the rest of our experience was positive. Our server was extremely friendly and we got the Yuzu mimosa and agedashi tofu appetizer. The mimosa is exactly like what it sounds and super bubbly and refreshing with strong yuzu flavor. Agedashi tofu was delicious and the bonito flakes honestly tasted like a smokey fish jerky on top. The sauce was also great.

I got the Gyunan udon which I expected to be a bit more meaty and savory in flavor but it was a more light and clean broth (still very good). Udon is chewy and wonderful texture. The gyunan was a bit lackluster overall since the meat was not very soft and I think it could've used some more fatty slices of beef and more beef in general. I tried the spicy Niku broth and it was amazing so a better option for something more hearty. 

Matcha tiramisu is my favorite dessert and theirs wasn't my favorite version but still very good! I like how the matcha flavor was strong and it was not too sweet at all. The one thing I didn't love was the gelatin/pudding stuff at the bottom because the texture was a little weird but the flavor was great! 

I will also add it is super weird that the restaurant is separated into two halves. I was in the tiny half with the kitchen but the servers have to walk outside on the street for like 30 feet and go to the other side to bring food. The interior is nice but the setup is odd. 

Overall, I really like Raku but I prefer the Soho location since it is a bit bigger so less wait times. If it weren't for the host I would give this place a 9.3/10 but it honestly brought it down since service is an important factor for me. I enjoy the udon here despite the gyunan missing a little bit of flavor for me and being somewhat pricey but I will definitely return to try some more unique udons.",9/2/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,4,"Good comfort food. The restaurant was super cozy.

We were brought here by my friend who is a local, this is his girlfriend's favorite restaurant.

I ordered the yaki (vegetarian style) and my wife the toriten (chicken on the side so it doesn't get soggy).

I thought the chicken from the toriten was amazingly juicy. The yaki was really flavorful with a tomatoey sauce, and the cabbage in it was fresh and crunchy.

My wife thought that the seaweed broth from the toriten soup was okay but liked the noodle texture and the chicken.

Big portions too, lots of noodles, but options on the menu get pricey really easily.

Staff were friendly and easy to flag down when we wanted to order more noodles.",20/3/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,4,"My friend and I met up for the first time in 2 years here and had a really warm and yummy lunch - a perfect place to catch up and eat well. We arrived right when they opened and there was already a small group of people lined up waiting to get in. The inside is small and cozy, reminding me of Japan. 

We started off with the chicken tatsuta-age and we immediately needed to down some water after taking a bite. Although it was flavorful and the batter was nice and crispy while the meat was tender, there was way too much added salt and not even the spicy mayo nor lemon could balance it out. I was disappointed since I had read rave reviews on their karaage. But I did appreciate that you could choose between 6 or 10 pieces of chicken.

Now onto what we came here for and what ultimately saved this meal - udon! I ordered the kamonan (duck breast) while my friend got the tantan udon. Portions are crazy big. If I weren't here to visit, I would have split this into lunch and dinner but I ended up finishing it and walking out looking pregnant. The duck was extremely tender and the noodles were cooked to perfection. So bouncy, chewy, and everything I have ever wanted. Incredible broth and if I wasn't already so full, I would have drank every last drop of it. Overall a comforting meal that left me satisfied.

The service was great up until the end, when something out of the ordinary happened to us. After payment and tipping, one of the waiters came up to us and told me that I had tipped so low (I tipped 15%, which is average?) and he ASKED for my reasoning. Dumbfounded and confused, I had to reassure him that everything was okay and hurried out of there. I was telling another friend about this and she mentioned that the same thing happened to her after dining at this location as well. Maybe they were trained to do this? Just an awkward and very weird experience. Amazing noodles, though.",4/2/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"dined at this exceptional Japanese comfort food restaurant and was thoroughly impressed. Their Chicken Tatsuta-Age stands out as the best I've ever tasted. Tatsuta-Age is a style of Japanese fried chicken where the meat is marinated in soy sauce and mirin, then coated with potato starch before frying, resulting in a crispy texture and rich flavor.  The service was impeccable--both swift and courteous. Omg, that bacon is sizzling and delicious. The egg broth udon soup is also very satisfying and warming. Very thick! 

Having visited Japan, I can attest that the decor authentically captures the ambiance of traditional Japanese eateries.",8/3/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"Best udon spot in the city! There's something so satisfying about Raku's udon - it's al dente so it has a nice chew. Their udon soups are so homey and full of umami.

As a lot of people have said, the udon was a bit overhyped, but was refreshing for this summer day. Super friendly and fast service. A little cramped indoor seating, but spacious outdoor area! 

Sabazushi (Mackerel sushi, $8) {4/5}: I liked the smoky flavor on this grilled mackerel. Add the togarashi from the table if you want a little spice 

Zaru (cold noodle with dipping sauce, $14) {3.5/5}: The dipping sauce was a good balance. It came with a raw quail egg, real grated wasabi, seaweed, and scallions that you mix into the sauce - the highlight of the dish. The noodles were just okay 

Maitake (Mushroom tempura add-on, $6) {1.5/5}: No flavor on its own, had to add togarashi and dip it into the udon dipping sauce. Not that crispy either

I got the Tantan and really enjoyed it! The udon here is good but I think what sells me is the soup. I'm a soup lover to my core and this soup was warm, flavorful, and rich.

Udon is the star here. It is excellent!",27/5/2024,Food & Beverage
Raku,4,"The eggplant appetizer (yaki nasu) was yum and probably my favorite part of dinner! The pork was smoky and savory with a hint of spice, which meshed deliciously with the buttery eggplant. Highly recommend trying, especially if you love eggplant. 

Udon here was good but not something that I would rave about. I tried the ankake, and the noodles weren't as bouncy & chewy as I would have liked. My soup came out HOT though, so that may have cooked the noodles more. The soup temperature was satisfying though and would be great in the winter. The broth was nice & thick and mild in flavor.

I am a bit picky with udon after having spent more than half a year in Japan, but Raku's udon has just the right chew and I appreciate the wide variety of options of both udon and appetizers. In the winter I gravitate towards their duck (kamonan - long island duck breast, tokyo negi) or beef (gyunan - prime beef, tokyo negi) options, while their zaru udon (chilled noodles, shiso leaf tempura, dipping sauce) with extra tempura is a wonderful summer option.

They can get quite busy so I would recommend trying to get a reservation or allocating ample time to your dining experience. Food comes out relatively quickly once you are seated.",18/6/2024,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"Visited Raku with a friend while visiting the city, and as usual, we had a great time! We were seated outside almost instantly around 2PM on a Sunday. 

For starters we ordered a salad and the Karaage. The salad was a solid starter, and while delicious, it was very much on the nutty end! So if you're not a fan of nuts, maybe give it a skip. 

The Karaage on the other hand was superb, a very solid Karaage with a moist inside and a great, crunchy exterior. The sauce they provided was also very good!

As for the udons themselves, my friend ordered the Snow crab udon while I got the duck breast udon, and both of them were superb. The noodles were perfectly chewy, the broth was to kill for, and the duck breast was incredibly tender and flavorful.

The ramen was fantastic--I had the spicy beef curry, and the flavors were bold, with generous portions that left me fully satisfied. My only complaint was the service; our server seemed in a hurry for us to leave. She dropped the check on our table before we even asked, which made us feel rushed.

For the main course, I had udon in dashi broth, which was flavorful and comforting. Overall, the meal was enjoyable without feeling rushed, thanks to the good pacing by the staff. I recommend Raku for anyone looking for a reliable and satisfying dining experience. I'm looking forward to going back to try other dishes!",8/5/2024,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"(Overall: A) - The East Village location may have a slightly different menu from the SoHo location from what I've heard, but their thoughtfully developed broth and fresh tender udon continue to be a draw. The service is also reasonable and the atmosphere has the basic necessities for comfort including an outdoor patio with heaters, umbrellas for the rain, and a clean bathroom. Would recommend.

(Niku Udon: A) - This udon bowl is paired with an assortment of beef cuts that are braised to tenderness. I love to deep earthy development in the broth of the soup to pair with their fresh udon noodles. The only thing I would improve about this bowl is to give more of the delicious meat and vegetable, but otherwise its beautifully executed.

+ Fried Chicken: these were a little spicy. Hubs quite enjoyed this
+ Pork Gyoza: basic but delicious

For the main course, I ordered the Sansai which came with ""mountain vegetables"" and maitake mushroom tempura. The mushroom tempura was out of this world.

The inside is pretty small with one bathroom. There's more outdoor seating than indoor seats. We were seated outside which was a little cramped and a little scary right by the road. Service was attentive and fast. We ordered the Niku udon and a duck udon. I enjoyed the Niku udon more. The soup flavor was light but flavorful and the udon noodles were chewy. I wonder if they make their own udon noodles because the shape is a little different, the ends flare out like a trapezoid. The Niku udon didn't have as much meat as I would've liked. The duck udon was even lighter. 

Oh, they give these frozen grapes as a little treat with your check. 

Overall: I remembered it being better. It was still good but I wasn't that impressed and I also felt like the prices are a little expensive. I do feel like the Niku udon is a little overpriced.",1/4/2024,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"The curry udon was really good in terms of flavor and size. It took me 2-3 meals to fully finish this dish, but was worth it.",24/3/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"When the aroma of Raku's Niku Udon first hits my nostrils, I am drawn to it like a crack fiend to a lit crack spoon. I immediately get transported to a hole in the wall noodle shop in Kyoto that is playing lofi bangers that Shazam can't pick up. Deep cuts only.

I came here alone on my lunch break today as on a cold rainy day my heart, mind, and soul immediately go to a Raku meal. This is a fantastic place for a solo meal to just come and enjoy your own company... while we are on the topic I get so annoyed when people be posting about how they are going on solo meals. Like can't you just go do that and not post about it? Was it really a solo meal if you gotta tell everyone about it?..... Well I guess I'm doing that now just in Yelp form ahahaha damn.

The Niku Udon's spice level is just enough to make your nostrils run and let out one of those quick little ""woooo"" breaths out of your mouth, which is my idyllic spice level.

The voluminous bowl, which consists of a light flavorful broth, silk noodles, beef short-rib, nori sansho chili oil, tendon, and honeycomb tripe is my hangover cure. Well that and a couple puffs of a pre-roll but that's neither here nor there.

I let out an audible ""wow"" on my final sip of the broth, as my soul needed it. My soul been hella tired lately idk why.

My only complaint is that $27 before tax and tip is just steep. It can't be a weekly occurrence for me, as much as I would like it to. Once a quarter vibes smh. But that just seems to be the price of doing business these days in New York. I've spent $27 a lot worse......

Still my favorite rainy day meal in NYC.

Raku,5,"After wandering around East Village for a bit, we looked on yelp to find a spot that was open for a late lunch. The pictures here looked good so we decided to try it out! The outside of the restaurant is definitely unassuming and if you weren't actively looking for it, you could easily miss it. I ordered the Tantan udon and my friend ordered the Niku! The Niku was very light and easy on the stomach. The tantan was extremely delicious and had lots of flavor, however be warned it is quite salty and rich. Overall would definitely come again and it's one id the better udon restaurants I've been to.",12/9/2024,Food & Beverage

Raku,5,"Definitely the best udon place in manhattan. Tsurutontan doesn't even compare.

Place is quite small and cramped, and can get busy so I would recommend an off time or put yourself on the waitlist.

I ordered the niku udon (spicy) and the chicken tatsuta-age (10 pieces). At first glance, the prices are expensive ($26 for niku udon), which is insane for a noodle dish. However, they do not skimp on the portions for meat and noodles. The udon was spicy and had a rich broth, but the noodles were by far the best part. The noodles were the bounciest and chewiest noodles I've ever had. The meat was tender and flavorful as well.

The chicken tatsuta-age was very crispy and big portions as well. Def worth getting as an appetizer.",22/1/2024,Food & Beverage

Raku,5,"The noodles....... are so good. I'm not a ramen nor udon lover and generally picky about my noodle soup. But this is the spot. The interior is cute and minimal, music is barely there, just guest murmurs- kinda packed around 7pm on a Saturday, but our party of 2 got seated in 15 min and we sat outside. Food came quickly and the server was very friendly. The beef udon has to be the best. I got the spicy pork miso which was good but in general I prefer clear broths. I love burdock root and that didn't disappoint. Again, it's THE udon spot",22/8/2024,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"DEFINITELY reserve if you want to go as it's always super busy. Their chicken karaage was okay, but the udon is the best I've ever had--the closest to an authentic udon experience. Staff was really friendly and made sure we had a good time while there. Will always be going whenever I'm in NY.",21/8/2024,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"The portions are generous and were perfect to eat during a cold rainy day in New York. I went here with two of my friends who mentioned how popular and good this place was, which I do agree with getting a reservation as the usual waiting times for a walk-in would be around 45 minutes. I got the curry udon and shared the chicken tatsua. Everything here that was served was so fresh, the chicken tatsua was so hot when it came here and the same with the udon. I liked the udon that I got, with how thick the curry broth and the noodles were chewy. I thought the ribeye beef was good, though as a protein it wasn't anything revolutionary. With the reservation, we got seated in the dining room which was cozy and intimate, with spacious tables. Our service was also great too, they ensured that we were well taken care of and liked everything to our taste. I would come again as it is a pretty affordable casual lunch / dinner spot that is honestly worth the price. I have no complaints with this place and I liked their finishing touch of giving frozen grapes after the meal, it was a really nice gesture.",25/5/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"One of my favorite udon places! The noodles don't disappoint. It's so bouncy and chewy and Al Dante. I tried their shrimp tempura udon and the flavor was amazing. 

They're quite busy so the service was fast. The place is super cute and I enjoyed eating there!",19/2/2024,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,I came at 3pm and it was basically empty. There was indoor and outdoor seating available. Staff was friendly. There is a small restroom available. I love the simplicity of this restaurant. I ordered the beef udon and it was simple and delicious. Id definitely be coming here often if I actually lived in the area.,15/8/2024,Food & Beverage
Raku,4,"Raku scores on udon texture and refreshingly flavorful broth.

My friend and I came 30 minutes after they opened and indoor seating was full so we opted to sit outside in the heated tent. Since we were seated outdoors, there wasn't much of an ambiance. The indoor ambiance also followed a Japanese minimalist blueprint and a little dark since there were no windows to let in natural light. 

Service is quick, efficient, and unintrusive. You can tell the business model here is to bring out the good food and turn tables as quickly as possible. Even without the servers pressuring you to leave, you can feel the pressure if people are waiting for your table. But that's with any popular restaurant in Manhattan that is affordably priced so Raku is no different.

Food wise, the udon is definitely fresh and the noodle consistency is king. Both the thinner noodles in my Spicy Niku Udon and the thicker noodles in my friend's Tantan Udon were the perfect amount of bouncy. The broths in both udons were also delicious with the Spicy Niku broth being lighter but flavorful and the Tantan broth being rich and decadent. They also give a decent amount of protein in each dish.

For the quality and price, Raku delivers. But don't expect to sit for hours and catch up with a friend when there is a line out the door. Get your udon, slurp, and onto the next.",10/2/2024,Food & Beverage
Raku,4,"NOT cash only anymore! 

Was able to walk in after a short wait on a weeknight and service was fast and friendly despite the how busy it got soon after. 

I got the kamonan udon which was pretty mediocre in flavor, both in broth and duck seasoning. Honestly not too sure what the fuss was about but maybe I didn't get the ~right~ udon. The noodles themselves are amazing though, with the perfect amount of chew. Good portion size too",7/2/2024,Food & Beverage
Raku,4,"A solid spot for quality udon! Tried the cold udon in this summer heat and it hit the spot. Service is good but the space is so tiny so it was very loud inside (hard to hear the person across from you speaking) and tables were very close to one another. Will try a different Raku location next time, hopefully will have a better atmosphere inside.",6/8/2024,Food & Beverage
Raku,4,"Never had cold udon before, but this dish was the most refreshing dish for a summer day! We went in for dinner on a Friday night and had to wait about 45 minutes for a table, but the wait was sooo worth it. We ended up sitting at the bar, but it was just 2 of us and honestly the vibes were great and service was super fast.

Cold Udon Yamakake: (9/10) This dish comes with grated mountain yam, quail eggs, and bonito flakes -- so delicious ! The udon noodles are chewy and thick. The green onions and flakes are crunchy and provide the most complementary texture with the chewiness of the noodles. Each spoonful was yummy af

Bloody Mari (8/10): This drink was tangy and zesty, a nice blend of tomato-y and citrus-y flavors. However, I felt it was a little too strong for my taste and didn't really pair well with the udon. Could just be my preference though, so take with a grain of salt",23/6/2024,Food & Beverage
Raku,2,"It was hotter in this restaurant than it was outside... mind you it was 92 degrees today. 

I feel as though customers should be told beforehand that there is an AC issue prior to making a reservation as this seems like an ongoing issue from previous reviews. 

As I walked in I thought oh it's hot but like any other restaurant I'll probably cool down in a couple minutes but that never happened.  The food was not bad but I would never come back due to the AC issue. I was eating hot soup noodles while sitting in this sauna of a restaurant trying not to overheat. 

Would not recommend.",4/8/2024,Food & Beverage
Raku,4,"I think Raku truly lives up to its hype and is the place I take friends when I need to introduce them to good udon. There are no reservations here and for a relatively small restaurant the waits can get a bit long, but usually on weeknights its doable to walk in here hungry and not have to wait too long. 

I tend to get the fried chicken here which is pretty tasty and always comes out fresh. We tried the monkfish liver as an appetizer once and was really pleasantly surprised by the texture and taste. You really can't go wrong with the udon choices here - the udon noodles are nice and chewy and stand out here compared to other places. 

Service is friendly. Bring cash - they don't accept card here. There's a reason I've come back to Raku time and time again. Nice little spot in the East Village.",24/6/2024,Food & Beverage
Raku,4,"I came into Raku on a very hot day in New York. I got a cold noodle dish and vegetable tempura (which was hot, but I cannot resist tempura). Food was very tasty.

Raku,5,"The best udon I've ever had. The texture of the noodles was springy, chewy, and desirable. The broth was super clean tasting. Such a simple bowl of noodles had so much flavor. I arrived for lunch just as they were opening and was immediately seated. The establishment is small with only a few seats so I would recommend coming early or during off times on the weekdays if you don't want to wait for a seat. After I ordered, the food arrived quickly. The server was attentive and checked in on me to see if food was to my liking. Would highly recommend this spot.  This place makes my must try foods when visiting New York.",12/7/2024,Food & Beverage
Raku,4,"Hmm, a little overrated in my opinion but was still good. Would rate 3.5/5 but rounded up to 4/5. It's so difficult to get a reservation here that I thought the food would be seriously mind blowing, but that wasn't really the case. 

The texture of the udon noodles were perfectly chewy and delicious and portion size was excellent, but the broth came lukewarm instead of warm/hot which made the meal a bit disappointing. My friend's bowl was the same case. I love warm soup noodles on a cold day, but Raku didn't execute the way I had hoped. I thought the room-temperature broth was odd, but maybe I came at an off time? Seating and service were all good, perhaps I will give Raku another try to see if my second impression is better... but with there being so many good ramen/udon spots in NYC, I don't know...",26/12/2023,Food & Beverage
Raku,4,"The fried chicken is so savory and juicy. The slightly spicy dip on the side is so satisfying to have and the lemon cuts through the friedness of it. 

The ebiten udon has a lovely broth and the udon is always chew and bouncy. The shrimp tempura is fried well and is light. 

This place always requires a bit of wait, but it is pretty darn worth the wait. My friend loves coming here as much as possible and who can turn down a steaming hot bowl of udon on a cold day?",23/11/2023,Food & Beverage
Raku,4,"A great noodle spot with a good variety. The taste was a good mixture of nutty and savoury with a good char taste of the meat. The inside seating is very small, so if people near you are speaking loud, it's hard to talk with your table mates. Service was fast, didn't need a reservation on a Saturday night.",10/7/2024,Food & Beverage
Raku,4,"Great vibe, delicious udon. Would I wait more than 10 mins..? Meh probably not. I might be the odd-woman out tho... hehe 

I got there 10 mins before it opens at 12 noon, a party of 3 was already in queue... once they raise up the ""blue"" mini-curtain, it means they are open for guests.  (Very Japan Culture!). Very cozy inside, a few solo counter seatings and a few tables for parties of 2 & 4 combo.  They also offer outside seatings.  Simplicity in decor - no clutter!  Service is great, efficient and warm. 

I got myself the wakame (seaweed) udon + shrimp tempura.  The udon texture was bouncy, chewy and silky... delicious! The mixture of seaweed was a yummy distraction... from the slightly over-salted broth... just a tad bit. The shrimp tempura was nice & crunchy (honestly, I've had better ones...).  So... I enjoyed my udon very much but would I go out of my way, walking 8+ blocks from my train station... and do it all over again? Not really. Only if I'm around the area and by chance with no wait time. 

Raku was on my bookmarked spots for a while and then it kept popping up in my IG feed from a few ppl I follow... this one was definitely an ""influenced"" eat.",29/10/2023,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"Raku has got to be one of my favorite udon places! I went on a Friday night with a friend around 6:30, and we got seated at the bar immediately.

As for food:
- Chicken Tatsuga-age: 5/5 Super crispy and flavorful! The pieces were big and soo juicy, the chicken was dripping after every bite.
- Ebiten Udon: 4.5/5 The noodles were definitely the best part of the dish - they were so soft and chewy! The broth also had a nice umami flavor, but it came out a lukewarm instead of warm/hot as I had hoped.

My friend also ordered the Wakame (seaweed) Udon which she said was really good!

Overall, the udon here is great and definitely hits the spot on a cold day. Their noodles are probably the best I've had in NYC. I would definitely come back to try their other udon dishes!",6/1/2024,Food & Beverage
Raku,4,"i got the curry udon and it was just okay. the noodles weren't chewy/springy as i expected and the flavor was a bit watery for my liking.

First, the service was fast. All the staff were very nice and attentive. We sat in the outside portion, but the overhead heaters were nice and toasty, such a cozy ambiance!

As for food, we ordered the chicken tatsuta-age,
spicy Niku udon, and gyunan udon. Everything was so delicious. The fried chicken was crispy and soooo juicy. The udon had a qq element to the noodles, not soggy and had a soft, chewy bite to them. The broth wasn't salty, and you could actually enjoy all the flavors. 10/10 restaurant and 100% not overrated",30/12/2023,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"The JaJa udon was very refreshing with a good kick of spice.  Karage was well fried and the chicken was juicy.  The service was good, with multiple servers coming to check on us throughout the night.  The restaurant was clean and well lit.",22/6/2024,Food & Beverage
Raku,4,"Ambiance (4/5): The inside nicely lit with a clean Asian decor. It is very tight with approx capacity of 20. However the outdoor dining is almost double the inside. We sat outside and (as expected) decorations were a bit sparse. The noise levels were moderate. 
Service (5/5): It is a walk-in only. We waited about 20 min before getting seated at 6:45ish. The staff checked in on us often and our glasses were regularly refilled. Our food came pretty quickly.
Niku (3/5): the broth is unbelievably umami! The portion of meat was meager and felt like there was more tendon  and tripe than it was short rib. I was expecting a bit more for the $26 price point. If you ask for the spicy oil on the side, there's much less than if you ordered the spicy version. 
Sesame Apricot (3/5): it was a beautiful presentation but the taste didn't blow me away. There were hints of the sesame in the cake layer and then added sweetness from the bottom layer of apricot. It's a great dessert to split amongst 2.
Yuzu Sake (5/5): we had 2 pours each between 3 with the middle size option (400c).",12/5/2024,Food & Beverage
Raku,4,"Yummy Japanese spot. Prices were pretty decent for New York. I got the curry udon with beef. The udon noodles are nice and chewy. The bowls are huge!

They have a nice outdoor seating area with heating lamps, so outdoor seating was enjoyable even in the cold.",9/11/2024,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"Expect to have a decent wait time on the weekends. We were a party of 5 and had to wait around an hour to be seated. The place is pretty small itself but they do have outdoor seating. Servers were accommodating and kind.

Raku,5,The best udon ever. I used to go to Udon West but after it closed I was never able to find good udon. This is better!!

Will be back !!!,22/2/2025,Food & Beverage
Raku,5,"WOW. This place is amazing. They have minimal seating inside the restaurant but they just opened the outdoor seating area so there's more seats available. The servers were very kind and attentive to our needs. 

The udon surprised me when it came out. It comes in a ginormous bowl and I thought that it was just the plating. But it was literally a never-ending bowl of udon. The broth was so clean and refreshing and the meat that came with it had soaked up all of the broth flavoring so it burst with flavor. I also am not sure but it looked like their noodles were hand pulled. The noodles were so chewy and bouncy. I would highly recommend this place for a good hearty bowl of udon.",30/5/2024,Food & Beverage

My friend had a reservation for the evening, so we didn't wait long before getting seated, but there was a line for those who didn't have reservations. They sat us at the counter so we were facing the wall but it was really nice cozy and intimate! Note that they also have outdoor seating. 

I got their cold udon noodle and my friend got their hot beef udon noodle. Both were delicious! Noodles were really chewy and the broth for the hot udon was very flavorful. The sauce in the cold noodle was also flavorful, and tasted really refreshing. The dish came in huge bowls but the portion was actually perfect, I felt content and not overly fully afterwards. Definitely recommend checking out this spot!",29/10/2023,Food & Beverage

The marinated fried chicken appetizer / karaage was very delicious too - large juicy pieces that are crispy on the outside.

I was stunned. I did not expect a full bowl of curry but extra gravy to cover the rice as I like my rice soaked in gravy (see pic that the rice is clumped together and not every grain is covered with gravy). I mean it is personal preference and others may request for lesser gravy so they should not be loss. Will vendor charge less if asked for lesser gravy? In addition, it is common that most stalls usually more than happy to provide extra curry gravy. Further this stall is located in NTU where majority are students who are not working and the additional $1 for extra gravy is unjustifiable and ripped off. If there is miscommunication like the cost refers to separate bowl of substantiate amount of gravy, this should be communicated but the staff did not mentioned anything or clarified what I am asking for.

Encik Tan,4,"Read the low reviews here, think that it doesn't do Encik Tan justice and here's my review:

Food: They sell your usual Encik Tan fares like Curry Rice, Fishball Noodles, etc. Not the best you can get, but definitely okay for its price. $5 for a standard set of curry rice (Add $0.30 for takeaway). Top-up $1 for a lime juice, mid-sized cup, okay for an individual. Damage less than $7 per pax, though there are more expensive menus.

Service: Like fast-food, prompt and neat. Payment options include cash and credit card. Strangely, they don't accept PayNow or PayLah, despite being in a university campus, which is supposed to be chic and trendy.

Atmosphere: I've been to other Encik Tan branches which was really bad in terms of hygiene. This branch within NTU is air-conditioned and relatively clean.

Overall, a 3 to low 4-star, but definitely not those low star reviews you have seen here, which are emotionally driven in my opinion, not fair from a food seller view by Encik Tan.",2024-08-06T06:34:47.429Z,food and beverages

Predictably, the price is more expensive than comparable non-chain versions by $1-2 (most noticeably the noodles), especially considering such normal-ish portion.

The curry rice is alright, crunchy chicken cutlet size and taste are just fine, but the rice is too soggy especially when paired with the curry gravy. I'd say purely quality wise, the fishball noodle would sit in the middle of the pack compared to similar items elsewhere. For $5-6, I wish there's a bit more substances in it, for example more fishballs, mushroom, or dried anchovy.",2024-03-22T15:07:04.966Z,food and beverages

I have been a regular patron, often coming in for lunch weekly. However, I’ve noticed that the tables are frequently not cleaned promptly, which detracts from the dining experience. Given the restaurant-level pricing, I believe maintaining cleanliness should be a priority.

The sides (2 out of 3 from french fries, broccoli and corns) are served in large portions. For the soup, the mushroom soup is the safest option; tomato soup could be sour to some; pumpkin soup could be weird to some. The tea is freshly made on the day itself.

Saap Saap Thai,5,"This is a self-service HALAL Thai restaurant where order is placed on touch screen panels and payment is either thru the screen or at the cashier. I ordered the BEEF BOAT NOODLE DELUXE which is the most expensive among the boat noodle menu @ $10.90 a bowl.  It has a generous serving of tender beef slices, brisket cubes, tendons, and beef balls. These assorted beef meat are so tender, complimented with enough serving of  thin noodles cooked 'al dente', on a sour-sweet-spicy broth that is so refreshing to sip and slurp. The serving size and the delightful taste of the dish definitely justify the price. I also ordered their original Thai iced milk tea @ $3.00.  I'm not a fan of milk tea but ordered it just for the experience.  Fortunately, it is not the heavily sweetened serving that milk teas are known for. I would recommend this place as they have lots of varieties in their menu. I will definitely come back and try some other dishes.",2023-03-20T10:51:16.642Z,food and beverages

Here for a quick lunch, ordered their Tom yam prawn glass noodle set with wing 👎🏻 and Thai Garlic Black Pepper chicken rice set with fried item 👎🏻 which come with  “🪰” on it which is fully cooked just have to remove away however it still look disgusting and does make you lost of appetite.

Tom Yum is salty.
Milk Tea is sweet.

Saap Saap Thai,1,"Horrible price system and money hungry service implemented, 0/5. Will not come back again nor recommend anyone from wasting their money.

After we paid and ordered a mango tango classic, we wanted to change the order to the one with ice cream which was one dollar more. However we were told by the counter staff that it will be $1.50 more because it will be considered an add-on. I asked ""can't change order?"" To which the lady replied ""cannot"". And that was just within 30sec of making the order, an order which she haven't even start preparing. She was the only staff there. I asked if the ice-cream version of the mango sticky rice was the same and the difference was just the ice-cream, to which she said yes.
We didn't wanna argue liao and so we just say ""nevermind"".

Next our order came and it was a super sour mango sticky rice, we rated 1/5. I accidentally spilled the coconut milk syrup cup, losing 2/3 of the syrup and we went to the counter to ask if we can have another cup of syrup. It was a sealed cup and it was strangely tightly closed, resulting in a accident.

To my surprise the staff said, if it's spilled at the counter it will be free and we will have to pay $0.80 for another cup of coconut syrup. That's really expensive for just a tiny amount of coconut syrup. We thanked her but told her no.

Times are hard but really don't need such horrible pricing system. Not allowing us to change our order was clearly a hard sell to make us pay more.

Was served by a lady in black, which according to the receipt should be the manager.  Much saddened by this experience.",2022-07-30T08:22:06.397Z,food and beverages

Al Sheika Banana leaf Restaurant Pte Ltd.,1,"To be fair, food was average and probably deserved 3 stars. What made my review 1 star is that the cashier whom I believe was the owner then was really dishonest (or probably racist)

Extremely overpriced, even for Raffles. Well, I'm definitely sure that there is a price discrimination over here when selecting from the array of dishes for the briyani/rice. When the cashier told me the price of my dish, he could see my shocked face then he immediately started justifying the price of my food which made me believe that the price of my food has been intentionally upsized.

Will recommend for you to come if you believe you will be served the actual stated price, if you're not feeling confident that you will be paying for what it is worth, I will recommend the many other food options nearby. Will be trying the other Indian restaurant just 1-2 min down the road the next time. Pure disappointment and poor business ethics, maybe he thought he got away with a little quick buck today however what he lost was the trust with potential regular customers. Came with 3 other briyani-loving friends, but rest assured we will never be coming back and never getting our other colleagues/friends to patron this dishonest restaurant.",2021-03-21T02:44:49.248Z,food and beverages

This is the most underated Bak Kut Teh, Kway Chap and Pig’s Organ Soup.

A big bowl of ribs, $5 and pig trotters $5! Where to find…. And the fruit juice stall next to it… $3 for apple yakult. A generous whole bottle poured in and what’s best is you can choose the flavour of the yakult 👍🏻

803 Thai Food (803泰国小吃 @ Upper Jurong Road,2,"Review: Disappointing Thai Meal Experience

Ordered three dishes and was thoroughly disappointed with the overall quality and preparation.
•	Green Curry: Watery and overly dominated by coconut milk, lacking any real green curry flavor. The brinjal was undercooked—practically raw. We returned it and requested a re-cook, but the second version wasn’t much better. It still tasted more like coconut water than curry.
•	Tom Yum Soup: Lacked depth—neither spicy nor sour. Ingredients were minimal: just two prawns, some frozen-tasting chicken pieces, and potato squid. Felt like shortcuts were taken with the broth.
•	Fried Thai Egg: While flavorful, it was excessively oily and heavy.

Although the pricing was on the cheaper side, the food quality fell short and were poorly prepared, with little care in cooking or presentation. Sadly, it’s not a place I would return to.",2025-07-12T14:51:17.587Z,food and beverages

803 Thai Food (803泰国小吃 @ Upper Jurong Road,5,"Undoubtedly, this Thai Zhi Char stall in the west can be considered as one of the finest establishments of its kind. I had the pleasure of visiting it for the second time, this time accompanied by my family, and it truly left a lasting impression. The sheer quality of the food served surpassed our expectations, leaving all of us thoroughly satisfied.

One standout dish that captured our taste buds and brought us immense delight was the Tom Yum soup. Its tantalizing blend of flavors, combining the perfect balance of spicy, sour, and savory notes, was a true testament to the chef's skill. Each spoonful of the aromatic broth was a burst of culinary excellence that left us craving for more.

Additionally, the fired Hor Fun with wok taste was an absolute masterpiece. The skilled craftsmanship displayed in its preparation was evident from the first bite. The flat rice noodles were expertly stir-fried in a scorching hot wok, imparting a delightful smoky flavor and a slightly charred aroma. The combination of tender slices of meat, vibrant vegetables, and the tantalizing sauce made this dish an irresistible symphony of textures and flavors.

Not stopping at these highlights, we also had the pleasure of savoring other delectable dishes that further enhanced our dining experience. The Thai Pandan Chicken, with its fragrant pandan leaves wrapping succulent pieces of marinated chicken, was a delightful fusion of aromatic herbs and juicy meat. The Garlic Chicken, on the other hand, delighted our taste buds with its rich garlicky flavor that permeated every bite, leaving us wanting more.

To complete our feast, we decided to try the Thai Cockles, and they did not disappoint. These plump and juicy shellfish were cooked to perfection, highlighting the unique briny taste that makes them a sought-after delicacy. The accompanying sauce added a delightful tanginess, elevating the dish to new heights.

All in all, our visit to this exceptional Thai Zhi Char stall in the west was nothing short of an outstanding culinary adventure. The food quality, attention to detail, and the overall dining experience were truly remarkable. We left the establishment with contented smiles on our faces, grateful to have discovered such a gem. Without a doubt, this place has earned our highest praise, as there was absolutely nothing to complain about.

The pizzas didn’t taste the same as they used to — the flavor was noticeably worse, and the amount of ingredients, especially the toppings, seemed significantly reduced.

I’ve always enjoyed Domino’s in the past, but this time the quality was far below what I expected. It’s really disappointing to see such a decline.

Domino's Pizza Upper Jurong,1,"Service super slow and not attentive. Wasted 20 minutes waiting for the food that is sitting over there.
4 Domino store in Singapore given me disappointing service. (Tried 5 store in Singapore)
Luckily I paid $6 per regular pizza so I don’t expect they make another hot pizza for me.

TLDR:
I have placed my pick up order and 5 minutes before I arrive, food was ready to pick up. When I arrive I saw my food (only pizza) sitting on their cabinet. I told the person in red domino shirt that I am here to pick up my order. The guy in red shirt proceed to tell me to wait and he will talk to his colleague. Alright I wait for 1 minute, and he has his personal video call to make. So I sat at the chair there giving them enough ample time assuming that they are in the midst of preparing another order (assuming short of staff). But 20 minutes later, they started preparing another order which pisses me off. I approach them and they acted stupid like why I didn’t tell them I am picking up the order. The whole 20 minutes, 10 minutes I am standing infront of the counter (obviously, waiting in line), 10 minutes sitting on the chair patiently.
If is not your constant advertisement online, I wouldn’t try this another time.

Store owner:
I have attached my receipt, you can check your cctv of how I have waited for your staff. Even if you have heater for the pizza, your Aircond is quite cold too. The box is hot, the food turn cold 10 minutes after I left the shop. Not worth for pick up in this case",2025-05-10T13:26:54.434Z,food and beverages

Domino's Pizza Upper Jurong,2,"I ordered Domino's for breaking of fast at 3.20pm on 23 March 2025. I chose the delivery time of 6:30pm. At 6:45pm, our order was yet to be delivered, however, from the live tracking on both the website & email, both stated that the order was being delivered. So decided to wait a little longer, thinking that the delivery could be a little later due to break fast time. By 7:10pm, the order was yet to be delivered. I called the branch from Upper Jurong since the order was coming from there. The manager from the said branch, named Dinesh, answered the call. It was stated by him that our order was number two in the queue & there was no delivery riders to send them out. We were shocked to hear that they had no riders at that timing, when it was closing to the time of breaking fast. Despite the frustration, Dinesh was still patient with us, through the call, & assured that we would be getting our order by 7:45pm. To add on, he said we could call them back if our order was not received by then. So we ate what we had first & at 7:45pm, our order was delivered. From the damped boxes & plastic, it can be seen that our order had been done way earlier but kept there for a while.
Thank goodness the food was scrumptious. It would definitely be more scrumptious if it was consumed when hot.
❗❗ALERT for other customers, pick up would definitely be  better than delivery. ❗❗

Suggestions to Domino's:
- have the time slot blocked, if you know that there wouldn't be any riders available at that time
- have a waiting time stated on the website or app, to alert customers for the wait
- if possible, have personal riders instead of external riders
- get riders from trustable sources & platform",2025-03-24T07:32:52.274Z,food and beverages

When we finally called through the staff told us they were still looking for riders. I don’t understand how they couldn’t have taken the initiative to call us first to update us? The staff then told us he would call back in 15 mins to give us updates. Not only did he not call us back but we couldn’t call through for the NEXT 3 HOURS. By 3 ish we finally manage to call through to get the refund. Absolutely horrendous service.

Douraku Sushi,5,"⭐️
16 Aug 2025: The SG60 Omakase set menu is really super value for money. The quality in all the dishes are fantastic. Chef’s signature no. 1 roll is also bursting with flavour. Simply delicious.

6 Aug 2023: There’s a cheaper $60+ Omakase set for lunch and it’s very value for money! Ingredients used are very fresh and of great quality. Oyster is plump and juicy; otoro melts in your mouth, so does the A4 wagyu; scallop is Q-ey and good; Uni is buttery and creamy and sweet; yuzu ice cream is refreshing and satisfying!

Dec 2021: The $89 Omakase set might seem a little on the expensive side but it also comes with a bottle of sake. The chef’s selection is not bad and mostly fresh! Uni is not as sweet as expected but the salmon is fantastic as the cut has a good mix of fats in it making the sashimi melt-in-your-mouth 👍🏿

multiple times but nobody picked up. My order was $100+ and i had to physically head down to the store to ask for more order and guess what it wasn’t even ready and was told to continue waiting. The staff also said that they had a lack of manpower and it wasn’t their problem. There were a few other people who had issues with their orders as well and one of them was told that the outlet didn’t have enough dough?? 😂. Wrote in to dominos and was only offered a voucher with a minimum order of $15.00 hahaha and they asked if i received my order after 1 whole day😂.

Second time they delivered half an hour late. Funnily enough, they started making the order near to my delivery timing(8pm) then delivered half an hour late(8:30pm). Many times when I try to call them, no answer. The “crispy fries” I ordered were all soggy even though the delivery is distance is so close. The pizza taste is okay though.

Absolutely Horrible waste of money.

All the other comments are also pointing to the horrible service and food, and the replies that  Domino gives is always the same, trying to improve, but there is absolutely no change in the attitude or service.

Never ordering from this place ever again.",2025-04-02T12:39:00.322Z,food and beverages

Domino's Pizza,1,"I am extremely frustrated with the service I received. I ordered $60 worth of food from Domino's NTU on FoodPanda at 5 PM, with an estimated delivery time of 40-60 minutes. However, after an hour, I still hadn't received my food. I attempted to call the store multiple times but no one answered. Additionally, I couldn’t reach anyone through the FoodPanda app since it stated that the food was being delivered by the outlet’s driver and couldn’t be tracked.
Another hour passed, making it two hours since I placed my order, and I had still received no updates. The app still showed my food was “preparing.” Finally, I was able to get through to someone at the outlet, but he sounded unsure and was unable to provide any useful information. He took my details, mentioned that the driver had been sent, and then said the food had been placed at the lobby . When I told him I hadn’t received any food or communication, he took my details again and promised to call me back after checking. However, no one ever called me back.
I then went to check in person, and to my disbelief, the food had been left outside on top of a fire safety box for over an hour without any notification. I called the outlet again and explained the situation, but the staff member(ANN)  defended the store's actions and claimed the driver had delivered the food. She also said most workers are old and might not understand, which is completely unacceptable.
I am thoroughly disgusted with this terrible service. Since the food had been left outside for over an hour in a fire safety box, it was no longer safe to consume. This is not the first time I’ve had issues with this outlet. The last time I ordered, the driver left my food on a table outside without informing me.",2025-02-17T15:12:31.053Z,food and beverages

Service and atmosphere need improvement.
- the female staff couldn't adequately communicate on English to take order
- moving of canned drinks from storage spot and some cans toppled, noisy
- female staff spoke loudly to fellow colleague  = noise
- staff used his legs to tuck the stools under the table  and resulted in squeaky noise

Price is really decent, quite rare to find this kind of value nowadays.

The auntie might seem a bit grumpy at first, but she’s actually really nice. I asked to change one half to roasted, and she helped check if there was any ready at the back, had to walk all the way around the stall to do it too.

Uncle Leong Signatures,3,"Visited Uncle Leong Signature for lunch on a weekend around 12pm, and to my surprise, the place was completely empty.

We ordered a few dishes and unfortunately, the experience was quite disappointing. The fried ee mian was particularly bad — the oil used for frying tasted old and reused, which left a really unpleasant aftertaste. On top of that, the sauce was bland, and overall the dish just didn’t work for me at all.

We also tried some of their dim sum. The fried mango prawn dim sum was another miss — once again, the bad oil taste stood out, and the mango was bland and tasteless, far from the sweet flavour you would expect. As for the chee cheong fan and fried carrot cake, they were alright, nothing exceptional but at least edible.

Overall, I would say this place is just alright, but given the quality of the food, I would seriously reconsider visiting again.",2025-04-27T15:07:17.731Z,food and beverages

Uncle Leong Signatures,1,"Was there for our reunion dinner on 28 Jan 2025.  We booked the time of the dinner at 730pm but was only serve and provided with the seats at 830pm.  Nevertheless, the receipts ended up with 10% service charge.  As it is CNY, we did not dispute with the restaurant and made payment on that day.  It was after this that i checked on the CNY Menu we ordered and noted that there is indication that there is no service charge and the only ""+"" should only be the prevailing GST of 9%.

I what's app the restaurant and request for a refund of this 10% over charge.  Was immediately answered with a call from the restaurant.  The in charge highlighted that the 10% charged was not service charge but surcharge for CNY and claim that she had spoken to me before.  I do not recall this communication instead highlighted to her that the menu sent to me clearly indicated that there is only prevailing GST on top of the CNY menu cost and clearly states that there is no service charge nor CNY surcharge mentioned.

If the dinner has been good for this dinner, we do not mind to take this as a tip to the team and not asked for this refund.  However, the reunion dinner was delayed from 730pm to 830pm and by the time ended was closed to 11pm.  My dad (elderly) was left with hungry stomach and food served around 9pm were not freshly prepared with some dishes already turning cold and not well heated.  My family's young children were cranky due to the long wait.

Such service do not deserve any service charges nor surcharge.  If only, the surcharge was clearly communicated in the menu, we may have picked another restaurant instead of this.  Thus, this is clearly a mis-interpretation of their cost.

I tried speaking to their so-call boss, but sadly he said he can't do anything.  However, when i ask why this is not indicated clearly in the menu, he mentioned that this is their usual charge and that there is a notice on that day of the dinner which placed outside the door.  Isn't this not ethnical as customers are probably only aware when they are there.

Hope this can inform all about their restaurant CNY standard with underlining conditions that are not clearly stated on their menu cost.  Please be wary. I am taking this up with CASE now.  Hope they can provide us with a fair resolution.",2025-02-09T01:53:50.485Z,food and beverages

SZ Kitchen @ Joo Koon,5,"SZ Kitchen at Joo Koon is a great spot for comforting zi char favourites, and two dishes stand out for me: the hor fun and the milky fish soup. The hor fun comes with smooth, tender noodles drenched in a rich, savoury gravy. What makes it special is the wok hei – that smoky, charred aroma that lingers with every bite, proof that the chef knows how to work the fire. It’s the kind of dish you crave on a rainy evening. On the other hand, the milky fish soup is hearty in a different way. The broth is creamy yet light, with a natural sweetness that blends beautifully with the fresh, firm slices of fish. It warms you up instantly, offering comfort without being cloying. Paired together, these two dishes show off SZ Kitchen’s ability to deliver both wok-fired boldness and homely, soul-soothing flavours.

Ordered 1 set for my breakfast, and I'm hooked, wonton is meaty and well marinated with a good size diameter to boot, mostly we get wonton with more skin then meat filling, but this is the real deal, it comes with a bit of prawn meat and chives incorporated into it.

The noodle is springy and doesn't bloat up when you order it as takeaway.

As such my default order will be a plate of wonton noodle + a bowl of wonton soup, muahahaha, eat till my heart's content.

Recently we also tried their port rib version, it is soft and well marinated also, do give it a go also, either ask them to add on top of your wonton noodle order or just order pork rib ver itself.",2023-09-04T02:35:51.522Z,food and beverages

Something was amiss after 30 mins and we found our Q number not being called while Q number after ours were called.

It was observed a lot of people waiting at the counter and I noticed dishes which we ordered were taken away. It occurred to me that people were not waiting for the Q number and simply taking the dishes on their own.

I fundamentally believe if you don't like your job you should either quit or do something about it and not vent it on the business's customers. Either the owners is oblivious to the situation or the staffs are putting up a front.

Staff wasnt patient at all when we asked about the ingredients displayed as there were no descriptions and it's our virgin visit. Asked for napkins if possible upon checkout and all 3 front staff quickly jumped on aggressively to say don't have, saw tissues at the cashier counter and asked if I could have one if not I could buy it and they said that's kitchen towels and not tissues so no. After seating down heard the staff complaining among themselves of how they haven't had their off days. I guess they are overwhelmed as they were are seating inside the counter on a toilet stool when we walked in. The place was empty tho with only 1 table of 2pax.

Food was good and super value for money as recommended by a fellow alumni. I personally feel it's underpriced for the quality.

To the owners I hope you're seeing this as you have a great business given your NTU story, and it will be a waste if you lose customers over stupid unnecessary things like this.

The tofu was good but there wasn’t much of it added.
You choose a few sides and a main. The base is salad and rice or pasta. I think that’s how it works…

The Crowded Bowl,5,"The food was fulfilling and tasty. Their portion sizes are perfect for me, I can eat a normal cai fan 3 ingredients and feel satisfied so their normal bowl is just enough. My favourite ingredients are the mock fish, corn and one other veggie or meat depending on what I feel like. I'm not going to dock points, but there are some ingredients I feel are pretty rough and just don't fit in terms of flavour and texture, like the fishcake looking tofu has a grainy feel and is almost flavourless. Other than that, choose between savoury or sweet and sour sauces to complete your bowl. Oh, and their scrambled egg is top notch, extremely creamy, soft and fluffy if you're an egg fan.

I dined in, and the experience was OK. Not too cold or hot, sometimes I guess one or two flies will make their way in due to the lack of a strong air-conditioning curtain? So one star off.

Service is excellent, staff is friendly, attentive and quick.",2024-02-10T02:42:16.236Z,food and beverages

The $4.50 option comes with 1 main + 2 sides, which the main are all carbs (Fusilli pasta, olive rice, potato). I asked if I could swap the main with some other veggies, but the answer was no from a staff in the evening (with some impatience attitude, probably tired throughout the day, let's give chance?)

Today afternoon (21-09-2024), I bought Meal with Mutton Intestine and chicken fry parcel, total cost $10.50 they charged, when i reach and ate the mutton totally no salt... really very sad, you people are charged so much but even your never taste it before serve to customer, it does not cheap!!!

when you're in hungry, if totally no salt in the food how you going to eat ????? ridiculers. it's about $10.50.

My strong recommendation to everyone, don't take parcel from this place.  if you want to eat just eat there. stupid people never taste before serving, and also charging too expensive...

Mother Earth Vegetarian Restaurant 大地之素,5,"A great vegetarian restaurant on the west side of Singapore. My family and I have been here a few times.

The service was fast with dishes after dishes. All the food is excellent and you won't go wrong choosing any dish.

My favourites are the Triple Satay Platter, Say No to Sharks' fin soup, chilli crab mantou, Kyoto Pork rib, Cereal Toufu, Creamy Abalone Mushroom, etc

After dinner, can go to nearby Jurong Point for dessert or some grocery shopping.",2025-06-09T09:35:15.454Z,food and beverages

Mother Earth Vegetarian Restaurant 大地之素,1,"Firstly, I didn’t expect a restaurant where you have to take your own plates and utensils, and even wipe your own table. If I could give a rating lower than zero, I’d give it -100. What kind of logic is this—calling it a restaurant but making it self-service?

And to top it off, they still had the nerve to add a 20% surcharge for CNY Eve. Understand that is CNY charges but come on such services trash.

Worst experience ever, Honestly, should I even pay that when everything is self-service?

There was a moment when all of our dishes had been cleared, but the new ones hadn’t arrived yet. When they finally brought the new dishes, they just stood there holding them, waiting for us to clear the space ourselves?

Even if it’s self-service, they could’ve informed us about it beforehand, not after the dishes arrive, when we have to walk over and ask. It’s basic customer service to let your guests know in advance, and that’s something any restaurant or service crew should do.

Don’t use excuses like “too many people” or “lack of staff” – that’s not the customer’s issue, it’s the restaurant’s. Don’t shift your problems onto the customers.

JING RAN RESTAURANT 第二家园餐馆,2,"We come to this place quite number of times as it’s convenience and close to my office. The food is fine , table is comfy, the price for the dish size is valuable but the service is horrible. I used to be in the FnB industrial for more than 5 years and have been to some different restaurants, food central…and I’ve never ever seen any other place in Singapore have this kind of service staffs. Over 4,5 staffs we often see around the floor and none of them able to greet customers properly, serve food to customers just bring to the table and place it on, even when they clear the empty plates they can’t even greet or ask for permission if we wish to have it clear, they come and go just silent like the robot. They serve the drinks: a bottle of beer without open it for customers just leave the opener on the table. Must be fair previous times they got open and leave the bottle on the table…🙁. I wish i can meet the manager or the owner and tell them if you really put intention to build this business then please at least train your staffs. Can’t expect for perfect service but at least basic service customer should require. when i type these words I don’t want to bring hate or make you less customers but i hope you will do something different and make it become a great place. ☹️☹️☹️☹️",2025-01-07T12:00:22.154Z,food and beverages
JING RAN RESTAURANT 第二家园餐馆,5,"Would recommend!

Tried a variety of dishes for dinner. They have a good spread of options, and the flavours striking in a way that speaks to their authenticity while being affordable.

Their dishes were great. The standout was the steamed sea bass, the fish was fresh, the texture was delicate but robust. Their vegetables were well seasoned, with stir fried beans crisp and flavourful. The egg and tomato was a simple dish but was no less satisfying.

Their food also did not shy away in the spice area, with the heat making a balanced roundness to the dishes without being overpowering. For those not well acquainted with spice, I’m sure they are amenable to requests to taper the kick. Though I do recommend it for the experience.

Service was prompt and attentive, complementing the dishes served. Would come again. They also have private rooms with KTV systems.",2025-01-01T10:58:59.994Z,food and beverages

Reason was menu price not right. What they charge is right 👏

And they don’t cook based on first come first serve. They serve people who dine in first. Then cook for takeaway. Waited 35 min for 1 frog and 1 rice 🤡

SZ Kitchen @ D’Arena,4,"SZ kitchen..... An interesting restaurant in the western part of Singapore. There are a total of 3.... One at Joon Koon interchange, one at Gek Poh ( closed as of Sep 24) and the biggest one  at D'Arena. The D' arena should be their flagship stall as the area serves a bigger crowd (round table that sits 10) while the others are catered to smaller lunch crowd.

One interesting thing about their flagship stall is that their have more stuff and zhi char dishes..... some unique offering is mutton fish soup. Have yet to try but might give it a go one day.

McDonald's,1,"Horrible outlet with rude staff. Very disorganised. The queue numbers on the screen are only there for show.

I ordered my food, stood in front of the counter, and watched the staff preparing lots of mobile orders. I saw my order number under “Now Preparing” on the queue screen so I waited. Then it disappeared. It was not under “Serving”, and no one had called my number (which I do not even understand since isn’t the point of the screen is so no numbers need to be called)?

So I approached this male staff at the counter and asked if my order was ready since the number was not on the screen. He glanced at my receipt and said rudely and sarcastically, “Ma’am please wait it has only been 3 minutes”. Even had the cheek to glare. I tried telling him that I ONLY asked because my number had disappeared from the screen and he replied loudly and impatiently, “I will call the number when it is ready” - as if I am supposed to be familiar with their messed up system. So much for the screen alert advising you to “Please watch here for your number”.

The patty on the cheeseburger was too salty, and the ice in my drink was already half melted.

Based on the reviews I’ve seen here, McDonald’s should do something about the staff and system at this outlet.",2024-03-15T22:37:51.086Z,food and beverages

McDonald's,1,"Ordered a dine-in meal at 1726 on 19 Feb. I waited in the queue all the way till 1756. I tried asking the manager(an Indian lady) where my order was, reasoning with her that orders from 1743 and before were already being served. The manager did not bother looking at the receipt and brushed me off, saying it's an automated system, and if I can't wait, she's more than willing to refund. Really bad response, worsened by what follows:
5 minutes later, another employee noticed that I've been there for quite some time and took a look at my receipt. She noticed something was very wrong and went back to the manager, who said she had already served the order since at 1730-something. Turns out they decided to serve dine-in orders in takeaway bags.

I don't think that's a standard practice? They could at least put a sign saying they are doing so. Hope the management can better train their staff to follow procedures properly, and at least try to understand the situation before dismissing or borderline threatening customers with a refund for something that's their fault to begin with.",2024-02-20T16:42:18.893Z,food and beverages

McDonald's,1,"I’d like to express my disappointment regarding my experience at your Joo Koon outlet. This morning, I ordered the Big Breakfast set and requested for butter, something that has traditionally accompanied the meal. However, despite asking multiple times, the staff firmly insisted that butter is now chargeable.

This may seem like a small issue, but it had a surprisingly big impact on what should have been a simple, happy weekend breakfast. Being denied a basic condiment that was previously complimentary and is reasonably expected as part of a “Big Breakfast” came across as unnecessarily petty and profit-driven.

McDonald’s has long been known in Singapore as a family-friendly restaurant that values customer satisfaction. If this is a shift in policy, I urge you to reconsider. Charging for something as basic as butter without informing customers in advance feels misaligned with the brand values many of us grew up with.

While I understand rising costs and operational decisions, these changes shouldn’t come at the cost of basic customer experience. A little butter should be part of the service, not an upsell!

I hope this feedback is taken seriously, as this seemingly small policy change significantly affected my overall impression of McDonald’s today.",2025-08-03T03:43:22.739Z,food and beverages

The sandwich preparation felt rushed and lacked care; vegetables were placed rather messily, portions were noticeably small unless specifically asked for more, and there was no lettuce in stock at all. Although the bread was put into the oven, it came out cold along with the cheese, suggesting the oven may not have been properly heated.

What shocked me most was the attitude of the floor manager, Henry. His tone was aggressive and he glared at us like he was picking a fight. Totally unacceptable behaviour. We weren’t rude — just asked about our food delay — but were met with zero professionalism and this kind of gangster-style response. Very disappointed and will never return.",2025-06-25T07:09:37.546Z,food and beverages
Captain's Table,5,"Absolutely outstanding experience at The Captain’s Table! Every dish was a delight, and the service was top-notch.

We started with the Fish Maw Soup—rich, flavorful, and comforting. The Steamed Fish was perfectly cooked, fresh and tender, with a light, fragrant sauce. The Roast Chicken was juicy with crispy skin and a hint of spice—so satisfying!

The Prawns and Scallops were incredibly fresh and cooked just right, while the Mushrooms with Sea Cucumber brought a luxurious, umami-rich depth to the meal.

To end on a sweet note, the Mango Puree with Pomelo and Sago was refreshing and not overly sweet—absolutely perfect.

What really stood out was the attentive and professional service. The staff were friendly, prompt, and thoughtful throughout the entire evening. Every detail was taken care of.

Tenderbest,1,"I was excited to try Tenderbest’s in hawker setup on April 2, 2025, but my experience was disappointing due to the cashier’s (women) attitude. When I placed my order, I mentioned I would pay via PayWave. She didn’t inform me that PayWave wasn’t available, so I stood there waiting for a terminal to tap my card. Instead of calmly explaining, she suddenly shouted at me, looking irritated, and pointed to the scan voucher option.

I didn’t even see the voucher scanner because I approached from the left side, and it was on the right. A simple explanation—like “We don’t accept PayWave, only PayNow or PayLah”—would have solved everything. Instead, she acted as if I had done something wrong. Even after I paid, she continued looking at me with an angry expression, which made me wonder why she was treating me like an enemy.

To make matters worse, when serving the food, she just tossed the plate down and said, “Chicken creamy pasta.” That was it—no courtesy, no service.

Tenderbest,5,"I don’t know why many people are hating on this store. But honestly I find the food quite nice, it’s acceptable but could be better.

I have tried tenderfresh @ Clementi and I could tell the halal standard (NEW) is better than this. I understand why is because this tenderbest store is using old equipment (eg. Fryer) and hence the fries look undercooked but still edible, I don’t blame them. Though it’s not hot but it’s still okay.

Chicken wise it’s like your typical hawker standard. It’s acceptable and I feel that I prefer this over the tenderfresh one because the tenderfresh appears more crisper than tenderbest.

The chili, garlic bread and the coleslaw taste very similar to tenderbest

However, Tenderbest should invest in customer services for their sub-standard service staff. Went down to their store at Jurong West Street 91 today (30th November 2021) during lunch time. Was horrified at how rude their female cashier was when comes to customer service.

It's not rocket science to know that such sub-standard customer service is not gonna help your business moving forward. Will be taking my business elsewhere until Tenderbest is able to re-train this female cashier.

From their menu, I decided to have lontong as it has been a long while since I last ate.

I was expecting the usual bland lontong, but was pleasantly surprised by their lontong.

The rice cake was nice and firm enough without it being too soft and lumpy.  The piece of tofu was fried nicely, soft inside but firm on the outside.

The lontong gravy was also very flavorful, and when mixed with their sambal, it turned out to be a very good combination.

Overall this would be amongst the top 3 lontongs that I have eaten in SG.

I noticed there is some minced meat on my bowl but  it was not stirred well with the chilli and put seperately , it lost a star for  it..  if tried scooping some minced meat with the chilli sauce, it will be more nicer.

Jia Jia Vegetarian,2,"The management should really do something about the queue system. Instead of asking the customers to ""自己来"" when it comes to adding the sambal chilli or green chilli, the staff could perhaps offer their help - perhaps consider placing the chilli inside and help the customers add before packing it?

Very often, they don't ask if pple would like chilli and straightaway they proceeded to closing the box / tying the plastic bag. Then, these customers have to struggle to reopen the dabao box just to add chilli, and usually this action often blocks those who are waiting in the line. The lack of space in front of the stall and the lack of a proper operations sysyem really make the whole experience unpleasant.

Idk. I really miss the previous vegetarian stall tenant helming this stall. It was a local family who ran the business and making sure their food and service were the best.

The current business is run by an organisation who employs non-locals, who are here to work, and lack the personal touch. Everything also ask their customers to ""自己来""，if not fast enough, they will even shout from the inside and rush them to hurry. I am speechless.",2025-05-18T03:00:51.611Z,food and beverages

Chinatown Complex,5,"Chinatown Complex is one of the most iconic food centres in Singapore, known for its vibrant atmosphere and impressive variety of hawker stalls. Located in the heart of Chinatown, this bustling complex attracts both locals and tourists who come here to enjoy authentic, affordable, and delicious Singaporean food. The moment you step inside, you are greeted by rows of stalls offering everything from traditional dishes like chicken rice, satay, char kway teow, and laksa to unique specialties that reflect the diverse food culture of Singapore. One of the highlights here is the Michelin-starred hawker stall selling soya sauce chicken rice, which has gained international attention and long queues of eager diners. Apart from food, Chinatown Complex also has market stalls selling fresh produce, sundries, and daily essentials, making it a lively hub that blends culinary heritage with everyday community life. The overall setting may feel crowded and busy, but that adds to its authentic charm. Prices are very reasonable, portions are generous, and the variety ensures there is something for everyone.

Chinatown Complex,4,"I'm not sure why Google has this place as just a hawker centre, because Chinatown Complex is more than a hawker centre - housing a wet market at its basement level and a sundries market at its first floor; with the hawker centre at its second floor. Maybe it's because the hawker centre here is (apparently) the largest in Singapore with 226 stalls thereat albeit some of them not taken up when I was there today. Anyway, Chinatown Complex draws a lot of locals and tourists to its building and is a IMO historical icon in Chinatown. That said, the place may appear dingy to some, but heck, it's historical - and apparently, it's up for some refurbishment or more than that in 2026. The hawker centre is mostly serving Chinese or local Chinese cuisines with few or no other cuisines on offer. Well, it is Chinatown isn't it.",2025-07-02T07:57:16.480Z,food and beverages

It absorbs the gravy evenly and hence it taste better. Mee Hoon Kueh and noodles are hand made daily by owner too. Fried fish coated with a very thin batter too with good amount of fish.

Starbucks,3,"I had a very unpleasant experience at this Starbucks today.
The female staff member at the counter was clearly impatient from the start. When I didn’t catch her question about cup size, she rudely pointed at the menu and rolled her eyes, which felt completely unnecessary and disrespectful.

Later, when she asked “take it away?” (which she said too quickly for me to understand), I asked her to repeat, and she stared at me again before slowing down. Her attitude was cold and condescending throughout the interaction.

To make it easier, I had even prepared a screenshot showing exactly what I wanted — drink type, cup size, sugar level — and specifically asked for just one pump of syrup, but the drink I received did not match my request at all.

There was no queue behind me, no pressure or rush. Still, I was treated like I was causing a problem just for not catching her words the first time.

I always try to be respectful when ordering, and I understand that service work can be tiring — but basic courtesy is the minimum. I felt very uncomfortable and disappointed. I will not return to this store.",2025-08-14T08:02:34.561Z,food and beverages

The tea taste not that strong or lingering in the mouth as my tea-loving self would have liked, but a really soothing drink overall.

Wan Soon Lai Bakuteh & Fried Porridge,5,"Unfortunately, there aren't that many fried porridge outlets in Singapore. Plenty of Teochew, Cantonese, Taiwan congee, frog porridge etc, but precious few that actually serve fried porridge.

Apparently originating from Malaysia, the ingredients are first stir fried in a wok under high heat before adding the porridge base. When done correctly, the wok hei aroma permeates throughout the porridge, adding an extra dimension to a dish that for many represents the epitome of comfort food.

My favorite example of this porridge however doesn't even make it to Google's list of fried porridge in Singapore (again, you get plenty of porridge that isn't actually fried). Add to that, WSL is located in an industrial area not easily accessible by public transport (the nearest MRT being Joo Koon which is a 15 min walk away).

You don't have to worry about eating cold porridge here. The thick flavorful porridge is served piping hot in a claypot that takes a long while to cool down. Even at $6 it still represents fair value given how generous they were with ingredients. They keystone of this dish however,  is the wok hei and it's front and centre in WSL's porridge. Honestly, worth the trek out into the industrial heartland for this simple dish!",2025-08-14T14:26:21.469Z,food and beverages

June’s Breathe Cafe,4,"One pretty quaint lunch spot away from the more well-trafficked places in NTU campus, owned by a cheery middle aged couple. It's located in a concourse of the Experimental Medicine Building (third floor), accessible from the main North Spine complex from an overhead bridge.

Price is a bit more steep than in the cafeterias and they focus more on quality rather than portion size - perfect for dieting staffs and students. The menu is large - from pastries, sandwiches, cakes, wraps, cut fruits, coffee, and most importantly rice/pasta bowl with customizable topping (choices of meat, tofu, vegs). The pastries are served warm and fresh, and the bowl dishes' toppings are tasty. The coffee (espresso-based) is surprisingly pretty good and rather well-priced.

Can confirm sometimes there aren't enough seating during peak lunch time, albeit being situated inside a spacious concourse. More seating could be added so the customers can unwind.",2025-02-22T15:03:34.865Z,food and beverages

I notice that there’re a lot of students here studying, using their laptops, having group discussions without ordering food DURING lunch hours.

We share a plate of $5. It's super duper wet style hkm but if you look closely the gravy was ultra thick & very brownish. A little let down at first as there's no squid nor pork slices. Just prawns, but just one mouthful I understand it's ok without them. And the fresh and crispy pork lard and 2 pcs of abalone more than made up for it.

I think they are very focused on the prawn stock. It's heavenly good, very prawny & unami taste. Noodles were well cooked, portions great and there's really nice wok hei. Every mouthful goes perfect. Worth our long trip there.

Lu Heng Kee 盧興記 Hokkien Mee,5,"This is a well hidden gem of Fried Hokkien Prawn Noodles in Jurong West St 92. Long queues can be expected and they close by 1pm.

Servings are huge. Prices start at $5 for the small portion and $7 for the largest. For those with smaller appetites, the small portion is surely adequate for lunch.

Ordered the medium portion for $6. The noodles are fried in batches which explains the long queues. The Hokkien Mee here really conforms to my preference for wet, soupy type. Literally you can drink the left over broth. There is also ample wok heat and with the medium portion you get three shrimps, shell off tails on. The other major difference from other fried Hokkien Mee is that this stall does not use pork belly or squids. Instead they give you mock abalone which adds to the flavours of the noodles.

Speaking of flavours, my first mouthful imparted the Wow! factor. Coupled with the chilli sauce which packs quite the punch, the plate was slurped up within 10 mins, in spite of its size. Really didn’t regret ordering the medium portion.

In my opinion, this is definitely one of the best Fried Hokkien Mee in the west and I’ll be coming back for more! Strongly recommended.",2024-10-24T02:15:44.450Z,food and beverages

It was very moist, almost soupy. The broth is of pork bone and crustacean base, offering deep flavor. Egg wash gave it another depth. A good mix of yellow noodle and white vermicelli.

A squeeze of lime uplifted the dish. Lard was large and crisp while the chili was potent and went well with the overall dish.

Lu Heng Kee 盧興記 Hokkien Mee,5,"This hokkien mee would probably raise many red flags for hokkien mee lovers:

Thick bee hoon. Red flag.
Whole wok of pre-fried, ready-to-serve noodles sitting in the wok waiting for customers. Red flag
1 min of preparation time from order to serve. Red flag
Super wet version, noodles swimming in broth. Red flag.

In fact, the noodles were served to me before I could even get to the paynow confirmed payment page to show that I have paid. I was stopped from walking away to order my drinks after I have ordered, because my order was ready already. She merely scooped a huge ladle out of the ready wok for my $7 large order. Super red flag.

But all these red flags fell immediately upon my first sip of the broth. What in the world did they put into it? The crustaceans, wok hei, pork lard, seasonings, and the sambal belachan formed a formidable coalition force that penetrated deep into my taste buds. The full flavour was out of this world.

Mind you, the pork lard were not some fried pieces of pork fat lying around in a container. They were scooped out of bowl of pork oil, and it managed to retain its crispiness, and some. Similar to that used in bak chor mee, those dry pieces of mass-fried pork lard provided elsewhere, free-flow or not, cannot hold a candle to those served here.

The only gripe I have is that the noodles were a little soggy, probably owing to the fact that they have been sitting in the wok for a while, waiting for me. Sorry, I was late.

It is a huge pity that this stall closes so early in the day. In the parallel universe where you are situated in the east and closes only at night, you are crowned king of hokkien mee. Swee Guan bows down to you.",2024-05-30T16:45:01.948Z,food and beverages

This canteen excels in long term forecasting inflation. They priced their dishes so far into the future, you need at least two decades for other canteens to keep up.
The same combination of dishes for mixed vegetable rice will cost $6.40 in other canteens. Over here, it’ll cost a whopping $7.80. It’s not like a famous tire company gave them a star either (if they did then pls take it away, it’s trash tier quality).

NTU Canteen 4,4,"This is one of the smaller cafeteria in the NTU campus, smack in between one of its student dorms. Mostly advertises itself serving authentic Northern Chinese home-cooked cuisine and street food. There's not many stalls inside the cafeteria - only a cai png, jianbing guozi (savory crepe), drink stations, and interestingly, pizza stall.

I believe it's the only place where you can get authentic jianbing in NTU campus, or even perhaps in the entire West. The jianbing isn't particularly the cheapest thing (above $4.5 per serving), but it comes with pretty large portion. Big enough for heavy breakfast (I can see why it's popular among college kids) or even lunch. Soft in the outside, crispy in the middle, and rather generous filling of meat and cabbage in the center.

And at $4 a bowl, price is unbeatable.

And the taste is not too shabby too. We ordered Bak Kut Teh and Pig’s Organ Soup to share. The former was your quintessential peppery soup but it came with soft bone pork instead of prime ribs. The pig’s organ soup had more savoury and not peppery. There was stomach, liver, sliced pork, etc. We also ordered two bowls of rice. These came with a slab of braised Tau Pok on top and a ladle of braised sauce.

FP Juice,5,"FP Juice was obtained of fresh strawberries, apples and grapes. The FP juice was clarified and then cryoconcentrated to different water activities (0·96-0·87). A 60Co radiation source was used for treatment. The samples were stored at 20–22°C. The storage life, colour and sensory quality of the samples were studied as a function of radiation dose and water activity. It was established that a cryoconcentrate of 0·90–0·92 water activity when treated with 0·8–1·3 Mrad, dependent on the initial cell count, may be considered microbiologically stable at a storage temperature of 20–22°C and its organoleptic quality is satisfactory.",2023-04-11T17:27:07.304Z,food and beverages

Connect71 Cafe,1,"Rating this purely for the chocolate cake sold here. DISCLAIMER I SAY FIRST EVERYTHING ELSE HERE IS GOOD, I JUST WANT TO REVIEW THE CHOCOLATE CAKE. Let’s start off with looks cos it was what intrigued me and my friend to want to buy it. We agreed that it looked like the cake from the Mr Bean TV animated series and the cake from Mathilda that Miss Trunchbull made Bruce eat. It sounds like we’re glazing it’s looks but that was rly what sold us to buying it. Was only $4 dollars and was splitting it two ways so each oni paid $2 so not the worst as well. Now here is where it went downhill and sent us into the five stages of grief.

Act 1, DENIAL: First taste right off the bat, did not rly like it but still tried to convince myself that it’s decent.
Act 2, ANGER: The more we ate it, the more we realised how unexcusably bland it was. The texture screamed industrial cleaning sponge that’s never met moisture, the irony. And we were in disbelief and anger that we let our glutton appetite be fooled by the cake’s looks and price. It’s like we could use this to scrub a toilet and the toilet would’ve probably apologised for the inconvenience.
Act 3, BARGAINING: As we ate the cake, our anger turned into a struggle to find meaning of this cake. Saying how even cheap/ affordable cake stores like polar and primadeli can do a better job, cos their chocolate cakes actually have the taste of cocoa which doesn’t seem like a hard requirement. Calling it a chocolate cake might have been a big slap to the face of cocoa farmers worldwide.
Act 4, DEPRESSION: Reaching the end of the cake, we started to wallow in our thoughts and in our seats. Bloated from the amount of water we needed to drink to mask the weird aftertaste in our mouths after every bite. Saying, I miss how my mouth tasted before eating this.
Act 5, ACCEPTANCE: Finally finishing the cake, we left the place, with Phlegmy throats induced due to the dryness and weird texture of the cake. Accepting what we had eaten and there’s nothing we can do about it. So moving forward, we will not be ordering this cake anymore. BUT, we will still be coming back to eat the other food like the mains and the drinks, those are super solid 4/5. Staff are also rly friendly 5/5.

Xiao Di KKM & Hokkien Mee,5,"I’ve had my fair share of Hokkien Mee over the years, but every once in a while, you come across a plate that reminds you exactly why this dish is a local icon. Smoky, rich, and unapologetically messy, this version hit all the right notes.

The first thing that grabbed me was the wok hei, that elusive charred aroma that tells you the cook knows their way around a wok. It clung to every strand of noodle, wrapping the yellow noodles and bee hoon in a smoky hug. The gravy wasn’t overly wet or too thick, just the right amount to coat without drowning and packed with that deep, slow-cooked seafood umami that only comes from proper prawn stock.

The prawns were fresh and had that satisfying snap when you bite into them, while the bits of squid added a nice chew. But the real surprise? The crispy pork lard scattered generously on top. Golden, crunchy, and sinful in the best way possible.

Mix in the chilli and a squeeze of lime and the whole thing transforms spicy, tangy, and even more addictive. I found myself scraping the plate for every last bit.

Is it the healthiest meal? Definitely not. But if you’re after comfort food that delivers on bold flavours and that unmistakable wok-fired taste, this Hokkien Mee is hard to beat.",2025-08-10T16:32:40.230Z,food and beverages

Xiao Di KKM & Hokkien Mee,4,"Commendable fried hokkien mee by 2 young hawkers. It crossed over to the border of too much rock sugar in their stock to fry the noodle. Resulting in a little bit on the sweet side and noticeable sweetness.

Qun Fang Noodle House,4,"A humble friendly neighbourhood stall. Im picky abt the noodles and the sauce, first time trying as we passed by several times. Quite like their wanton noodles.

Saw someone reviewed that very little ingredient, i think maybe due to the 2 wantons so presentation wise looks abit sad but i would give up the 1 wanton for the tasty sauce haha. Tbh, wanton mee usually not much liao also. Taste is subjective, im glad i came :)",2025-07-05T12:31:04.615Z,food and beverages

Qun Fang Noodle House,2,"Can you really trust the earlier reviews? I relied on them and was deeply disappointed.

For sgd 5 wanton noodle, there was barely any ( any) ingredients.   While I understand many business owners may use rising costs as an excuse to save up on ingredients, but I do not think it's wise to charge people for sgd 5 with barely any 料。 the wantons are a joke.  The char siew are really just a few flat pcs. Vegetables are just a few pathetic pieces too.  Go if you are a Carbs lover ( not keen in ingredients)

For better comparison, I'm attaching screen shot of how OTHER STALLS are serving their customers by charging you only Sgd 5 a bowl.

Priced at $4.50 gravy is just night not too watery. Include skin, fried minced meat, fish cake, belly meat, fried wantan (it's thick and crispy still unlike other stalls where it's thin) and half egg. Pretty worth it.

Chef Kang’s Noodle House,4,"I was recommended this stall by a friend who mentioned that it had been awarded a Michelin Star. It’s located inside an industrial building canteen, and I queued for close to 20 minutes before getting my food.

I ordered their No. 1 Signature Wanton Mee ($7). The first thing that stood out was the noodles — noticeably more al dente compared to the softer, traditional style. The char siew came in five lean slices; personally, I would have preferred them a little fattier for more depth of flavor. The soup only had two wantons, but it was surprisingly rich and umami.

Overall, it’s a well-executed plate of Wanton Mee and certainly above average. That said, I still lean towards the more traditional version with its distinctive sauce base infused with subtle notes of dried octopus.",2025-08-19T15:15:24.872Z,food and beverages

Visited on a Sunday morning and coffeeshop is full and there were around 10 customers in the queue.. managed to get a table while still in the queue as the customers moved quite fast.

The chef cooks quite fast and the quite moved quite fast.

Orders the signature wanton noodles and wanton noodles with abalone slices. Added a plate of Char Siew which is$13

Char siew is superb and very tasty. The wanton is big and filled with meat.. the soup with the wanton is very tasty too. Noodles was a lot and very Q.

One of the best wanton noodle I've had ..

I wanna shout out to their soup n wanton which is usually not prioritize in wtm. The soup has a feel of double boiled soup where u normally experience in highend restaurants where u pay $50 for a portion. Hongkong style plump wanton fill with adequate ingredients n seasoning for the punch.

$7 for this bowl of comfort is 100% justifiable. For those Singaporeans always complain abt overprice n pricey , pls sometimes think n imagine how much work is put in at back of kitchen. The effort, sweat n heart that brings u a bowl of hearty noodle. Another $1-$2, cmon ! rate fairly ..",2025-08-14T03:43:20.180Z,food and beverages
Chef Kang’s Noodle House,5,You will almost definitely need to queue to order. The portion is large and will fill you. The noodles are well cooked and the nice sauce covers everything after tossing. The char siew quality is good and not too fatty. The dumpling is super delicious and is packed with lots of ingredients unlike other wanton noodles. The soup that the dumplings come with is also flavourful. Overall a lovely meal. No wonder they are a Michelin bib gourmand listing.,2025-08-14T03:18:34.717Z,food and beverages
Chef Kang’s Noodle House,1,"I was a first-time customer some time ago and saw a long queue, so I decided to return for a second visit. Unfortunately, my second experience was very disappointing due to poor hygiene practices. While preparing my food, a staff member used a straw to dig his teeth, did not wash his hands, and then handled my noodles with bare hands. When I asked him to wash his hands before continuing, he looked unhappy. I don’t mind what people do in their own time, but anyone handling food should wash their hands before touching it especially after such actions. This is basic hygiene. For a stall claiming to be Michelin-grade, the hygiene standards of the staff were far below expectations. Perhaps this is why there was no queue on my second visit.",2025-08-14T00:58:49.742Z,food and beverages

Basic is $7 ($12 if you add on shredded abalone) and cannot buy extra wontons.
1. Style - black sauce
2. Noodles - thin and crunchy. Not the type that absorbs sauce
3. Portion - generous veg, adequate noodles, 6 thick juicy slices of char siew, well fried pork lard
4. Char siew - was lucky to have a good balance of lean meat to fat ratio. But 1 slice was overly charred and I left it uneaten for cancer causing reasons.
5. Wonton - just 2 balls which in my opinion is better than 4 flat wontons elsewhere",2025-08-05T12:30:50.425Z,food and beverages

Chef Kang’s Noodle House,4,"Finally get to try their viral Noodles with Wanton and Char Siew after a 50 minutes queue on a Sunday noon. (Joined the queue from 11:55am, and placed my order at 12:45pm… waited for another 2 to 3 minutes for the noodles).

Anyway, it was worth the effort as for S$7.00, you get a restaurant standard Noodles with Char Siew and Wanton. The Noodles were firm and chewy, and tossed in a well-balanced savoury dark sauce with generous amount of lard.

Added a small scoop of sambal chilli to elevate the overall flavour further, however be advise not to add too much as it may be too salty for some.

Their Char Siew steals the spotlight with glistening caramelised edges, delicated balance of sweet, savoury and smoky too. Slices were slightly charred outside by tender and juicy inside, with a good mix of lean and fatty layers. Quite imilar to what was being served in Chef Kang’s Private Dining previously, but with even better ratio of lean and fatty layers, but cost about 3 times more. However i am not too sure if both are related, but both had similar logo.

Wantons were plump and filled with generous amount of minced pork plus other bits of ingredients, wrapped in silky skins and boiled till tender, served with rich and flavourful chicken broth on the side.

Will return again during off peak period on weekdays, as its too crowded on Sunday due to patronization of many families… Not only difficult to find seats due to the awkward seating arrangement of a canteen, but also uncomfortable to dine.",2025-08-04T13:24:50.220Z,food and beverages

Chef Kang’s Noodle House,4,"The good: Wanton was great (loved the inclusion of black fungus), wanton soup was unique (opaque and peppery), chili was fragrant (I can't really take spice so I usually skip chili but I compromised on this one by adding a bit with each spoonful!). Noodles did not have the alkaline taste (cause it's the bamboo one?). Lard was great, would recommend not stirring it into the sauce if you want to keep its crunch. Char siew was good!

The not-so-great: Noodles were a bit too soft for me, but then again I love extremely al dente noodles. But sadly these were just passable but not ""tiak"". The sauce also sadly did not stand out (probably why I felt the need to reach for the chili).

Too warm and sunny (it's ""indoors"" insofar as you're under shelter - it's at the corner of an industrial building), but if it was raining I imagine a good portion of the tables would get wet.

It's a good bowl of wanton noodles (one of the best according to Alderic), and I left feeling satiated and glad that I made a trip down to try. But given the queue and seating conditions, I don't see myself coming back just for it.",2025-07-31T00:00:00.373Z,food and beverages

It's basically a 1 man show, chef taking orders and cooking at the same time. Absolutely loved the noodles, it was al dente and doesn't have the alkaline taste. The wanton soup is also amazing. The char siew is a little bit too fatty for my liking. Some bites were almost pure fat.

Kokoro Izakaya,4,"Great ambience for japanese Restaurant. Food wise is also good, presentation is also pretty. 😊

One bad experience is that the Miso soup cover has formed a kind of vacuum and it makes the lid  difficult to open. And when opened , the soup tend to spill / lid fly away. I recommend to change to an easier to open lid, because not only did I experience this opening lid challenge, my colleague also experience similar case. The crew quickly changed new green tea for me when I accidentally bumped and dropped the Drink. Kudos to the great quick Service.

Kokoro Izakaya,3,"I didn’t realize they had a live band, I wasn’t quite prepared to be dining in a noisy loud environment. Food was really average and some below average. Service was so so. I ordered a bottle of Ozeki Umeshu but they ended up serving a different Yuzu bottle instead. Although server came back to inform the one I ordered was out of stock and they’d gladly refund the wrong bottle served to us but it’ll be good if this was done upfront instead ie inform us the one we ordered was outta stock and check if we wish to order some others. The eventual bottle that was served to us didn’t even offer me any buzz even though it showed 14% alcohol on the back of the bottle. Not sure if it was kept too long cos there were definitely some yellow stuff floating on the surface when we poured the drink into a cup.

Crave Nasi Lemak,1,"Hi CRAVE Nasi Lemak , Im referring this to your Joo Koon fairprice hub branch.

I ordered a nasi lemak ayam berempah today, meant to be given to the kids. However, I found it upsetting and off putting when i saw the following scene unfolded right before my eyes.

Your employee, who was packing the order was sneezing openly with no cover. Granted, the person tried to turn away from the food area but still sneezed openly, multiple times.

She then proceded to wear a black mask.

Subsequently, before she continued packing, she was wiping her nose with a tissue while having the food gloves on. I did not see which hand (gloved or not) which was used to wipe her nose. Nonetheless, she did NOT EVEN WASH HER HANDS prior to packing the food.

Looking at this disgusting behavior, i did not even want to inform your staff and walked away without collecting the food, even though payment had been made.

For an F&B business, i believe staff should be well aware of hygiene when operating the store. This was actually food meant to be given to kids and the lack of hygiene awareness is baffling.

Hope you would take the necessary actions to prevent this from happening. Thanks.",2025-08-24T13:48:26.189Z,food and beverages

Spicy braised chicken feet - The braised sauce is extremely fragrant and flavourful, with an umami flavour. It's not your usual salty braised sauce. The chicken feet were so soft that the bones fell off with ease.

Tried brown sugar bun and tomato with egg as well, but not too special.

Hi Noodle,4,"Surprised to spot this outlet inside this shopping mall. Should have guess that it is under the same management as haidilao. Already tried at their original outlet at Somerset 313 when they were newly opened. And then also tried at the outlet at Woodleigh mall. Totally new & differ concept from the other 2 outlets. More towards the traditional cai fan, yet can do it yourself to take the dishes. And make payment at the weighing machine. Thks for the free ice-cream again. And really small portion for the noodles. Felt so full after finished eating 😋

Updates : went back again. Still as yummy. Hope they have other outlets at city area with this similar concept. The lotus soup was tasty. First time ordered the soup. It was really good. But this time round, didn't collect the token for their free ice-cream.",2024-09-27T17:37:19.909Z,food and beverages

Payment is convenient, there’s someone there who helps with the machines as well. The tomato noodles were pretty good. They have a condiment station, be sure to get their signature chilli sauce!

At the end of your meal, return your trays and remember to get the coin from the dispenser! The coin can be exchanged for cotton candy or ice-cream.",2024-08-19T06:51:03.366Z,food and beverages

Hi Noodle,5,"This is my third time at Hi noodle, and I finally understand why it exists. It is everything that Haidilao isnt, for good reason.
Don't want people to talk to you? Check.
Want things fast? Check.
Want low sodium? Yes, yes, yes.
Don't want food scalding hot? Check.
Don't want food too spicy? Check.

Hi noodle is healthy fast food, for small crowd who wants to eat and leave. All the food start out a bit low-salt and low-spice. I've tried suan la fen and chicken liver noodles and I was quite disappointed initially, but then I saw the condiment counter with chilli, soya sauce, vinegar and then I realise - oh thats why. If you want healthy, you found the right place. If you want more seasoning, you've gotta masterchef it yourself.

For sides, I've tried a lot. Here are some personal favourites:
Potato 土豆丝 $3.90  vinegary, not spicy.
Braised Quail eggs $4
King oyster mushroom $2.50
Minced garlic pork 蒜泥白肉 $5.80 (fantastic!)
Mapo tofu $4.90 (not spicy, not salty)

Believe it or not, I ate all the above with brown rice ($2). I can't believe I'm eating brown rice at Haidilao chain, but yes. Healthy. If I didn't order pork, it felt like Greendot healthy. Nothing was salty, so those looking to cut salt, this place is for you.

Ice cream is fabulous. Better than mcdonalds. Wafer cone was crispy and sweet, and the ice cream wasnt icy, but very thick, rich and creamy.

Inclusive of GST, no service charge (no one dancing with noodles or singing bday song or giving your kids toys)

Ambience very nice and clean. You can pick and mix your own sauce on their sauce bar. Foods are nice, had their soup with rice and noodle and some vegetables. Get your free ice cream after returning your tray after dine in.

However as the chili provided was only chili soaked in oil, this did not help with the taste at all. Noodles were so hard I suspect they were under cooked. The only saving grace is the soup which had some taste to it. Spicy oyster mushrooms were normal tasting.
At least the service staff were nice, not the best but at least they did their job.

椿风满面 (Chun Feng Man Mian) Chun Noodle Bar - Amoy,5,"Rating: 4.8 / 5 stars

On first sight — a tiny bit pretentious, like the fusion ramens of Amoy. However, I was quickly proven wrong. This is easily the best char siew wanton mee in Amoy Street, hands down.

The store has few but solid offerings and at a reasonable price point. Here’s what to expect:
- Char Siew: an appropriate cut with a good amount of fat, the meat was well marinated and caramalised.
- Noodles: fairly standard, but executed well. The seasoning sauce mix used works
- Chilli: was slightly sambal-ish and smelt punchy, but turned out to complement the flavours of the dish really well. Noticeably, it didn’t add too much saltiness to the dish.
- Wanton: nothing to shout about.
- Soup: was essentially tonkotsu ramen soup, though milder. I feel ashamed asking for a refill.

Portions were fair, though I do wish that they were just a little more generous with the noodles. Additional noodles are available for $1.

Fan Ji Speciality Noodle,4,"Special Mushroom Mee Pok w/ Meat Ball (No.2)

Overall, the meepok is decent, however, the meepok he uses is thicker than most others, so that might throw some off, due to the textural difference. The saucing of the noodles was a tad too salty, but I'm still ok with it. But let me rave about the soup which is chock full of thinly sliced wongbok giving the broth a natural sweetness and the HerKio (Fish Dumplings) were on another level. Hard to come by a great HerKio these days, and this was awesome.",2025-08-05T07:55:59.354Z,food and beverages
Fan Ji Speciality Noodle,5,"Must go weekly BCM. If you have not tried Fan Ji (previously Ah Hoe Mee Pok), it's a delighfully fulfilling meal that tastes just different from everyone else. There's a variety of choice of different toppings & ingredient. It looks expensive, but I'd rather have this because of the exceptional value the meal provides. Firstly, you can ask for extra noodles (no extra charge). For set 5 ($9), my go to meal, I get 2 slices of abalone, 1 shrimp dumpling, 1 teochew dumpling, lots of cabbage, lean meat, minced meat & braised mushroom other than the SOP precision timing cooked noodles (mee pok) & a wonderfully hot & tasty soup which usually is an after-thought of the meal.

Fan Ji Speciality Noodle,3,"I ordered the prawn paste specialty noodle. Overall, the taste was pretty good. The noodles looked plump, but still had a nice bite, decently sauced. The soup was sweet, a little porky and there was a decent amount of prawn paste cubes, minced meat and cabbage.
However, the cabbage was a little too crunchy for my liking. It was not nuah enough and the cabbage juice was bitter with no vegetable sweetness. The prawn cubes were good, but could be bouncier and the texture could be better, such as tasting individual prawn pastes held together, rather than just one cube by itself. The overall dish was not proportioned very well. Both my dining companion and I finished the noodles way before the soup and ingredients were finished.
Basically, noodles done decently but have room for improvement.",2025-05-25T16:26:15.910Z,food and beverages

The noodles were perfectly al dente, the sliced pork tender and fresh, and the soup packed with rich, deep flavors. Their mushrooms are incredibly juicy, adding a nice texture to the dish. The dumplings also deserve praise, as they have a great balance between the delicate skin and flavorful fillings.

However the chili sauce and the base sauce for the noodles were very different from the original Ah Hoe Mee Pok. The pork lard used tasted factory made not hand made and the soupbase was blend. Overall it is still an ok noodle dish. However when i ate this, it brings back memories of the original ah hoe mee pok and how i wish this bowl of noodle could live up to it. I still have faith in Fan Ji Specialty Noodle. I just wish it did skew so far away from the original taste. I understand the young owner may want to put his own twist to this noodle, i get it.

Their noodles are specially made for them, and they won’t sell either. And this competitive edge stands out well. Their noodle combos are mostly seafood based, the homemade prawn paste version is  especially nice. Definitely worth the drive to Ayer Rajah.",2025-04-16T06:05:25.153Z,food and beverages
Fan Ji Speciality Noodle,2,"Update: Unfortunately this place does not use the thick Mee Pok noodles which Ah Hoe used, see old review below. Also the sauce was too salty. I had to literally dunk the noodles in the soup before I could eat it.  Don't understand why there is still a queue.

The noodles are thick and not the factory made kind. It's perfectly cooked giving it a lovely chewy texture (very Q). Had the $6 bowl which has lots of ingredients and comes with a large bowl of soup. You can ask for more noodles at no additional cost.
The only drawback is the soup is not as tasty as some of the famous BCM stalls in SG but the noodles are definitely the best and you don't have to queue like crazy. Photo shows lunch time queue.",2025-03-25T07:14:57.310Z,food and beverages

The broth was rich and deeply flavorful, with a perfect balance of umami and sweetness. It had that slow-cooked depth that comes from hours of many ingredients, making every sip satisfying.

The noodles were cooked just right—firm yet springy, soaking up the broth without turning mushy. As for the pork lard, it was very crunchy, with just the right amount of fat to keep things indulgent but not overwhelming.

Overall it was a heartwarming dish that delivered on both taste and texture. Whether you’re craving comfort food or just looking for a solid noodle dish, this is definitely worth trying.",2025-03-06T12:46:23.937Z,food and beverages

Best part was the chicken wing was bloody. I decided that it was not worth food poisoning over as the chicken wing wasn’t much to shout about either.

Let's start with the lemak gravy.
It was rich but not too sinful or else you know the cholesterol is gonna climb up. The vegetables in the lontong was generous. Then we move to the rice cake.
Rice cake was soft and fresh. What more can you ask for? Pretty straightforward. And the hard boiled egg to compliment lontong. Lastly, the sambal was on point. Not too spicy to a point where it will be uncomfortable, but it was balance. Good enough to give that gravy a kick!
